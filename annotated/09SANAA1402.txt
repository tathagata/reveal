( [ORG S/NF  ] ) SUMMARY . 
On June 20-22 , a PM/WRA delegation visited [LOC Yemen  ] to discuss [ORG MANPADS  ] threat reduction efforts with [ORG ROYG  ] officials . 
Since 2004 , US-ROYG cooperation has dramatically reduced the availability of [ORG MANPADS  ] on the black market in [LOC Yemen  ] . 
Although the program has likely recovered the bulk of the illicit [ORG MANPADS  ] available on the black market , several more will likely be collected in the coming years . 
[ORG MOD  ] insists that there are no official [ORG MANPADS  ] stocks , and that they have already implemented necessary stockpile security and inventory controls , but the intelligence community and the [ORG National Security Bureau  ] ( [ORG NSB  ] ) believe that is not the case . 
The [ORG USG  ] will offer the [ORG MOD  ] , through [ORG NSB  ] interlocutors , payment for destruction of [ORG MOD  ] [ORG MANPADS  ] and stockpile security upgrades . 
[ORG ROYG  ] officials seem more receptive to a [MISC TSA-sponsored  ] [ORG MANPADS Assist Visit  ] . 
END SUMMARY . 
BACKGROUND ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) After years of uncontrolled weapons imports and the chaos of the 1994 civil war , [ORG MANPADS  ] were widely available on the illicit arms market in [LOC Yemen  ] , making these systems a critical proliferation threat . 
[ORG MANPADS  ] that leaked from official [MISC Yemeni  ] stocks were used in al-Qaeda ( AQ ) operations in [LOC Kenya  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , and [LOC Yemen  ] in 2001 and 2002 . 
In 2003 , the [ORG ROYG  ] began collecting [ORG MANPADS  ] from weapons souks throughout the country , and in 2004 the [ORG USG  ] agreed to compensate the [ORG ROYG  ] for the acquisition and destruction of these and other black market [ORG MANPADS  ] . 
In February 2005 , US-ROYG cooperation resulted in the destruction of 1,161 [ORG MANPADS  ] . 
MEETINGS READOUT ---------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) On June 20-22 , a [ORG PM/WRA  ] delegation consisting of [PER Dennis Hadrick  ] , [ORG PM/WRA Program Manager  ] ; [PER Santo Polizzi  ] , DHS liaison ; [PER Nils Talbot  ] , [ORG PM/WRA  ] technical expert ; and [PER Laurie Freeman  ] , [ORG PM/WRA Foreign Affairs  ] Officer , visited [LOC Yemen  ] to discuss US-ROYG cooperation to reduce the threat of [ORG MANPADS  ] . 
The delegation began with a June 20 meeting at the [ORG NSB  ] with [LOC Col.  ] [PER Hefed Al-Jamrah  ] , the [ORG NSB  ] official in charge of airport security in [LOC Sana'a  ] . 
[PER Polizzi  ] briefed [PER Jamrah  ] on the [ORG MANPADS  ] threat to civilian aviation . 
He also offered a [ORG MANPADS Assist Visit  ] ( [ORG MAV  ] ) , in which experts from the [ORG Transportation Security Administration  ] ( [ORG TSA  ] ) identify airport vulnerabilities to [ORG MANPADS  ] attacks and recommend ways to mitigate them . 
Following the meeting , the delegation toured the current airport and the site of the new airport . 
During the tour , several lapses in airport security practices were observed regarding passenger screening , cargo security , and [ORG Secure Identification Display Area  ] ( [ORG SIDA  ] ) badge and access procedures . 
[PER Polizzi  ] recommended that the [ORG TSA  ] Representative ( [ORG TSAR  ] ) in [LOC Amman  ] , [LOC Jordan  ] be contacted for follow-on discussions with airport officials . 
[ORG NSB  ] officials seemed receptive to the [ORG MAV  ] offer. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) On June 21 , the delegation met with [ORG NSB  ] Deputy Director [PER Ammar Saleh  ] to discuss ongoing efforts to acquire [ORG MANPADS  ] from the black market in [LOC Yemen  ] . 
Since the program 's inception in August 2004 , this program had resulted in the destruction of 1,161 black market [ORG MANPADS  ] in 2005 . 
[PER Hadrick  ] thanked the [ORG ROYG  ] for its efforts , expressed the [ORG USG  ] 's continued interest in supporting the program , and pressed the [ORG ROYG  ] to destroy an additional 102 [ORG MANPADS  ] they had collected since 2005. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Ammar Saleh  ] agreed with [ORG USG  ] assessments that the majority of black market [ORG MANPADS  ] had been collected in [LOC Yemen  ] , and said that a few more might trickle in with the increase in price . 
( Note: In July 2008 , the price for first generation systems was increased from $7,700 to $15,000 . 
End Note . 
) The small quantity of illicit [ORG MANPADS  ] that still exist outside of state control in [LOC Yemen  ] are in the hands of tribal leaders or [ORG AQAP  ] , neither of which is likely to part with them at any price . 
He could not estimate how many [ORG MANPADS  ] [MISC Yemeni  ] tribal leaders possess , but he believes that [ORG AQAP  ] has six [ORG MANPADS  ] ( [ORG NFI  ] ) . 
Finally , he expressed skepticism that the [ORG MOD  ] would accept [LOC U.S.  ] assistance to destroy its official [ORG MANPADS  ] stocks ( an offer on the table since 2005 ) . 
He believes [ORG MOD  ] would want a more modern air defense system in return , not cash payment or stockpile security upgrades . 
He offered to attempt to broker a cash-for-destruction deal. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Accompanied by [ORG NSB  ] official [PER Akram al-Qassmi  ] , the delegation visited a warehouse to view 96 [ORG MANPADS  ] collected between 2005 and May 2009 that were awaiting destruction . 
( Note: These systems had already been verified by [LOC U.S.  ] personnel and disabled . 
End Note . 
) The delegation verified an additional six [MISC SA-7s  ] , four [MISC SA-7  ] gripstocks , and six batteries collected by the [ORG NSB  ] since May 2009 . 
The delegation disabled the six [ORG MANPADS  ] and expended the six batteries. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) On their last day , June 22 , the delegation accompanied the Ambassador to a meeting with Minister of Defense [PER Mohammed Nasser Ahmed  ] . 
[PER Ahmed  ] denied that the [ORG MOD  ] has any [ORG MANPADS  ] in its official stocks , saying that they had already been handed over to [ORG NSB  ] and destroyed . 
( Note: This is in direct contradiction to [ORG NSB  ] , s June 21 assertion that the [ORG MOD  ] had excess stocks of [ORG MANPADS  ] , but would part with them only in exchange for a more modern air defense system . 
End Note . 
) The Minister described the [ORG MOD  ] 's progress on SA/LW issues since [ORG S/E Bloomfield  ] 's July 2008 visit . 
He noted that more than 250 weapons souks had been closed and more than 140 weapons dealers prosecuted . 
Furthermore , he remarked that the [ORG MOD  ] has established an inventory system for all [ORG Armed Forces  ] and [ORG MOD  ] weapons , all of which are now marked . 
He invited [LOC U.S.  ] officials to visit the warehouses to see how the system works . 
Finally , the Minister shared the delegation , s concerns about the airport , s [ORG MANPADS  ] vulnerability , and said that as a member of the [ORG Supreme Security Committee  ] , he would support a [ORG MAV  ] . 
NEXT STEPS ---------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Post  ] worked with [ORG NSB  ] to ensure that all 102 collected [ORG MANPADS  ] were destroyed on July 27 ( septel ) . 
[ORG Post  ] has requested a meeting with the [ORG MOD  ] Chief of Staff to observe the stockpile security and inventory control system reportedly in place . 
[ORG Post  ] will follow up with [ORG NSB  ] to find out whether it will accept a [ORG MAV  ] and , if so , identify possible dates for the assessment . 
( Note: Despite ministerial-level support , the final decision on the [ORG MAV  ] will be made by President [PER Saleh  ] . 
End Note . 
) Finally , [ORG Post  ] will work with the Department to present a specific offer to the [MISC Yemeni  ] government for assistance with physical security and stockpile management ( [ORG PSSM  ] ) and destruction and marking of [MISC Yemeni  ] SA/LW . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) It is hard to know what to believe regarding the presence or absence of [ORG MOD  ] [ORG MANPADS  ] . 
In a subsequent meeting on June 27 , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [PER PolOffs  ] that the [ORG MOD  ] does indeed have [ORG MANPADS  ] , but would never speak of them because they are considered a state secret . 
While [ORG MOD  ] realizes their [ORG MANPADS  ] are of little military value , they consider them better than nothing and would turn them over for destruction only if they were able to get a modern air defense system in return , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[PER PolOffs  ] agreed to continue negotiating the destruction of [ORG MOD  ] [ORG MANPADS  ] through [ORG NSB  ] interlocutors , since the [ORG MOD  ] appears unwilling to discuss the issue with [ORG USG  ] officials directly . 
END COMMENT .
