BRIDGEWATER FOR REASONS 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: Recent discussions with [MISC Ghanaian  ] officials and [MISC Western  ] diplomats paint a disappointing picture of the [MISC Ghanaian  ] Government , s efforts to combat its increasing problem with illegal narcotics trafficking . 
Several [ORG GOG  ] officials and others question whether [LOC Ghana  ] , s leadership appreciates the magnitude of the problem and whether they have the will and/or resources to address the problem . 
The [ORG Narcotics Control Board  ] ( [ORG NACOB  ] ) appears to have little clear direction or initiative , and one [ORG NACOB  ] official told us he suspects some drug &barons8 have penetrated [ORG NACOB  ] . 
The [MISC British  ] Government is considering ending its successful [MISC Operation Westbridge  ] project at the [LOC Accra  ] , s international airport due to dissatisfaction with [ORG GOG  ] efforts . 
The apparently high level of corruption or ineptitude at the airport was demonstrated in July , when [LOC UK  ] officials found packets of cocaine taped under passenger seats on a [ORG KLM  ] flight before passengers boarded the plane . 
The situation has generated substantial frustration among officials working to combat trafficking , and as one [ORG GOG  ] official told us , the [ORG GOG  ] must &wake up8 soon to the narcotics trade before it is too late . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Recent conversations with the [ORG Narcotics Control Board  ] ( [ORG NACOB  ] ) , [LOC Ghana  ] Police , and diplomats have revealed little confidence in [ORG NACOB  ] and [ORG GOG  ] efforts to battle the flow of narcotics . 
Without exception , each indifidual with whom we spoke said the problem was increasing and that the [ORG GOG  ] is largely clueless as to how to combat it . 
Some sources cited a lack of political will , while others said that the [ORG GOG  ] fails to understand the magnitude of the crisis . 
All sources agreed that if the present trend continues , [LOC Ghana  ] would likely see a corresponding rise in crime and drug abuse present in most transit countries . 
NACOB: NOT ACTIVELY COMBATING NARCOTICS ---------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG NACOB  ] , according to one of its higher-ranking officials , is motionless . 
This official XXXXXXXXsaid that the [ORG GOG  ] has effectively neutered [ORG NACOB  ] since the embarrassing arrest in the [LOC U.S.  ] of [ORG NPP  ] MP [PER Eric Amoateng  ] in 2005 ( ref A ) . 
All of the high-ranking officials during that time have been removed [ORG XXXXXXXX  ] . 
He said the [ORG GOG  ] was upset with [ORG NACOB  ] since it cooperated closely with the [ORG USG  ] on the case , which resulted in [PER Amoateng  ] , s guilty plea and subsequent imprisonment in the [LOC U.S.  ] He added that no one at [ORG NACOB  ] wants to rock the boat , including the new director , [PER Ben Botwe  ] , who lacks experience with narcotics enforcement. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The current deputy at [ORG NACOB  ] , [PER Mark Ewuntomaah  ] , is also a problem , according to [PER Gary Nicholls  ] , Second Secretary at the [MISC British  ] Embassy , and we agree . 
According to [PER Nicholls  ] , Secretary to the President , Ambassador [PER D.K. Osei  ] , had SIPDIS commented that [PER Ewuntomaah  ] should have stayed a retired police officer rather than being recalled to [ORG NACOB  ] . 
Our experience also underlines [PER Ewuntomaah  ] , s apparent unresponsiveness and generally incompetence . 
Despite repeated promises , [PER Ewuntomaah  ] was unable to even organize a tour of the airport for poloff. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) While there has also been a long absence of an Operations Chief at [ORG NACOB  ] , Post learned recently that the [ORG GOG  ] has designated an official for this position , but he is being sent to [LOC Germany  ] for language training to take a course on combating narcotics . 
He is not expected to begin work for six more months . 
[PER Nicholls  ] noted that the [LOC UK  ] no longer shares intelligence with [ORG NACOB  ] , but rather deals directly with the [LOC Ghana  ] [MISC Police.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG NACOB  ] official expects the [ORG GOG  ] to do little to combat narcotics until after the 2008 presidential elections . 
The current policy , he said , is to go after couriers , but not the &barons8 who are behind the deals . 
The official claimed the &barons8 are generally large supporters of the [ORG NPP  ] and he suggested that the ruling party has no plans to pursue these individuals even though many of their identities are known . 
He even suggested that some of the &barons8 have penetrated [ORG NACOB  ] by recruiting [ORG NACOB  ] officers to keep them informed . 
He also said that the [MISC British  ] , with &Operation Westbridge8 at the [LOC Accra Airport  ] , [ORG ACCRA  ] 00002140 002 OF 003 are the only real forces attempting to apprehend smugglers. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Leadership at [ORG NACOB  ] is clearly lacking . 
Everyone Emboffs spoke with concerning [PER Ben Botwe  ] , the current head of [ORG NACOB  ] , had little positive to say . 
He has spoken frequently about awareness programs , and his comments have changed little since our first meeting with him in June ( ref B ) . 
In a recent conversation with poloff , he suggested he is &ready to move on.8 He has made similar comments to our [MISC British  ] colleagues and the senior official at [ORG NACOB  ] confirmed these sentiments . 
Despite his apparent desire to leave , it appears that [PER Botwe  ] will remain for at least another year since he was asked by the President to assume this role . 
POLITICAL WILL: IS IT THERE ? ---------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) In a separate conversation , [ORG XXXXXXXX  ] , questioned whether the [ORG GOG  ] leadership has the political will and human and financial capital to combat the drug trade . 
He said the [ORG GOG  ] must &wake up8 and recognize the severity of the problem . 
He also said he has repeatedly warned [ORG GOG  ] officials of the ever-increasing narcotics flow but said they do not listen . 
The politicians , he said , do not realize the level of violence and crime that will occur should the drug trade continue to increase . 
He also noted that the [ORG GOG  ] is creating a new unit to focus on the drug trade. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Gary Nicholls  ] echoed concerns about the lack of political will , and said the [LOC UK  ] is considering ending its successful [MISC Operation Westbridge  ] project at [LOC Kotoka International Airport  ] . 
[PER Nicholls  ] said the [LOC UK  ] is upset about [LOC Ghana  ] , s management of the program . 
One problem , he said , is that [ORG NACOB  ] has removed the [LOC UK  ] trained [ORG NACOB  ] officers from the airport and replaced them with untrained officers who lack basic counter-narcotics skills . 
More troubling , [PER Nicholls  ] said , is that when the [ORG Westbridge  ] team is outside [LOC Ghana  ] ( it travels in and out from [LOC London  ] ) no seizures are made in [LOC Accra  ] ; however seizures increase markedly in [LOC London  ] . 
He provided us with a spreadsheet showing seizures through the program , and pointed out that no seizures had occurred in [LOC Accra  ] since July 25 , the day the team left [LOC Accra  ] . 
However , 29 seizures were made in [LOC London  ] through September 17 . 
[PER Nicholls  ] also pointed out an egregious mistake by the monitors in which [ORG NACOB  ] officials &missed8 a two-ton shipment of cannabis , which , according to [PER Nicholls  ] , is nearly impossible to not see . 
[PER Nicholls  ] said [LOC UK  ] officials have decided to put out the message via the [MISC Ghanaian  ] media that it is dissatisfied with the program . 
( NOTE: One article has already appeared in the [ORG Daily Chronicle  ] . 
END NOTE ) <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The statistics from [MISC Operation Westbridge  ] are quite striking . 
The ages of arrestees range from 16 to 55 and hail from [LOC Ghana  ] , [LOC Nigeria  ] , [LOC Romania  ] , the [LOC Netherlands  ] , the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC New Zealand  ] . 
Many carriers swallow pellets and one [MISC Ghanaian  ] died in July when a pellet burst . 
Others have attempted to conceal narcotics in herbal tea , pictures , hair gel , or suitcases . 
Perhaps most disturbing , [ORG Westbridge  ] officials found , before passengers boarded the plane , 1.8 kg of cocaine taped under passenger seats on a [ORG KLM  ] flight . 
Seizures seem to occur daily when the [ORG Westbridge  ] team is present . 
In total , since November 2006 , the operation has netted 350 kg of cocaine , nearly 2,200 kg of cannabis , and 1.3 kg of heroin with a total street value of over USD 120,000. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Many [MISC Ghanaians  ] and nearly all [MISC Western Diplomats  ] agree that the narcotics flow will increase without greater efforts to stem it . 
Several western Embassies have assigned officials to assist the [MISC GOG:  ] the [MISC French  ] have a full time Police Liaison , the [MISC Germans  ] are sending one soon , and the [MISC Spanish  ] Ambassador said his mission is also paying close attention to the matter , adding that [LOC Spain  ] plans to open Embassies in [LOC Guinea  ] and [LOC Guinea-Bissau  ] to monitor narcotics and immigration . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The narcotics menace , if left unchecked , will definitely damage [LOC Ghana  ] , s international credibility and its economic and political gains . 
We know the problem is critical when the Secretary to the President says that there is no one he can trust in law enforcement to share sensitive narcotics [LOC ACCRA  ] 00002140 003 OF 003 intelligence with .
