( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: In the days before his November 16 departure for the [LOC United States  ] , where he will speak at the [ORG OAS  ] and [ORG UN  ] and meet with [LOC U.S.  ] representatives ( [PER Dodd  ] , [PER Lugar  ] , [PER Baukus  ] and possibly others ) , President [PER Evo Morales  ] and his closest cabinet advisors lashed out at a wide selection of [ORG USG  ] targets , claiming that the [ORG USG  ] has a strategy of supporting a united opposition front against [PER Evo  ] for the December 2009 elections . 
Following the November 1 expulsion of [ORG DEA  ] , Government Minister [PER Alfredo Rada  ] described the [ORG DEA  ] as " insignificant " and said , " the world will not end with the end of the presence of the [ORG DEA  ] . 
" [PER Evo  ] announced that he is " after the [ORG CIA  ] " last week , and in a November 14 interview the state news agency [ORG ABI  ] cited Presidency Minister [PER Quintana  ] as saying that the " civic prefectural conspiracy " was " fed by the empire ( the [LOC United States  ] ) , financed by organizations that originate in [LOC USAID  ] , the [ORG CIA  ] , and the [ORG DEA  ] . 
" Speaking from [LOC Venezuela  ] , [PER Quintana  ] added [ORG MILGROUP  ] to the mix , saying that state security fired on civilians in 2003 ( during the riots that led to the fall of ex-President [PER Gonzalo  ] " [LOC Goni  ] " [PER Sanchez de Lozada  ] ) because " no state security institution is not taught , indoctrinated , and intervened by the [ORG DEA  ] , the [ORG CIA  ] , and by [ORG MILGROUP  ] .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) At a November 15 rally in [LOC Cochabamba  ] , [PER Morales  ] accused the [ORG USG  ] of trying to help form an opposition " front " to oppose his next presidential run: " I am almost sure , sisters and brothers , that the next elections ( December 2009 if the draft constitution passes in January ) , all the right will unite on instructions from the Government of the [LOC United States  ] . 
" At the same time , [PER Evo  ] reiterated his allegations that [LOC USAID  ] finances " the opposition " . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Meanwhile , analysts are weighing in on the issue of a combined front against [PER Evo  ] , whether comprised solely of the " moderate left " ( that is , the left without [PER Evo  ] 's [ORG Movement Toward Socialism  ] party ) or united with less- conservative elements of what is now the conservative opposition party Podemos . 
Former president [PER Carlos Mesa  ] ( an oft-mentioned contender for leader of the elusive non-Evo front ) opined recently that " a single front ( combining left and right ) is not viable in the sense that there are very distinct ideological positions between which , eventually , there would be opposition , but this doesn't eliminate the possibility of a front.. . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Evo  ] 's pre-emptive strike against a potential opposition front--aligning them without evidence with " the empire " --appears to be an effort to set the stage for discrediting anyone who runs against him as a [LOC U.S.  ] stooge . 
As of now the opposition is far from united , with as many as seven potential presidential candidates: former president [PER Carlos Mesa  ] , former prefect [PER Manfred Reyes Villa  ] , [PER Tarija Prefect  ] [PER Mario Cossio  ] , [PER Potosi Mayor  ] [PER Rene Joaquino  ] , [ORG Unidad Nacional  ] party leader [PER Samuel Doria Medina  ] , former president [PER Tuto Quiroga  ] and even indigenous guerrilla [PER Felipe Quispe  ] . 
It is hard to envision how this disparate group would come together , in fact , many of the strategists for potential candidates complain to us that other groups and leaders will not step aside for the good of the opposition as a whole .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to press reports , Minister of Presidency [PER Juan Ramon Quintana  ] met in [LOC Venezuela  ] on November 14 to propose a multilateral " strategic alliance " of governments and academics to defend the process of revolutionary change . 
[PER Quintana  ] reminded his audience of [LOC Bolivia  ] 's recent " torturous civic prefectural conspiracy " which he claimed had been " fed by the empire ( the [LOC United States  ] ) , financed by organizations that originate in [LOC USAID  ] , the [ORG CIA  ] , and the [ORG DEA  ] . 
" Back in [LOC Bolivia  ] , Minister of Government [PER Alfredo Rada  ] was also leveling accusations at [ORG USG  ] agencies , claiming that the [MISC Bolivian  ] government must deeply review the actions of agencies such as [ORG USAID  ] and [ORG DEA:  ] " it is a process that demands a more-global evaluation to take the decision to normalize this relation , and that means new rules of pay , transparency in relations and respect for sovereignty . 
" [PER Rada  ] said that [ORG DEA  ] was welcome to share information in the counternarcotics fight , but the [ORG DEA  ] is mistaken if it thinks it can " continue in the country or will return to the country to continue diverting resources of the fight against drugs to work of political destabilization or political investigation--that can't continue . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Rada  ] announced on November 16 that the [MISC Bolivian  ] [ORG National Police  ] who worked with [ORG DEA  ] will be reviewed and those that might have worked " on the margin of the interests of the country " will be fired . 
[PER Rada  ] warned that if " the police acted as a foreign embassy in their own institution , there will be a separation of these people . 
" He added , " If there are police who worked correctly , with good results , you can be secure that...they will be able to continue their work . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) From [LOC Venezuela  ] , Presidency Minister [PER Quintana  ] added new accusations against [LOC U.S.  ] agencies , claiming that [LOC US  ] agencies were behind the 2003 decision of the government of then-president [PER Gonzalo  ] " [LOC Goni  ] " [PER Sanchez de Lozada  ] to fire on civilians . 
" They consummated the most repugnant genocide in [LOC Bolivia  ] , which was the genocide of the year 2003 , when [PER Sanchez de Lozada  ] was expelled from the country . 
In the face of a lack of moderation , in the face of the doubts of the high military command to massacre the comrades en [LOC El Alto  ] , the [ORG Military Group  ] ( [ORG MILGROUP  ] ) occupied the highest levels of the armed forces and took the decision that the armed forces had to massacre the people of [LOC El Alto  ] to liberate a caravan that had to supply the city of [LOC La Paz  ] with fuel . 
Therefore , this is not indirect intervention , this is not interference , ( it is ) direct participation in the genocide of the year 2003 . 
" ( [PER Note: Over  ] 60 people were killed in clashes between followers of [PER Evo Morales--who  ] had blockaded the capital city of [LOC La  ] Paz--and government forces . 
The [PER Morales  ] government has repeatedly accused [PER Sanchez de Lozada  ] of genocide and recently began processing papers to request the former president 's extradition . 
End note . 
) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Following President Morales' November 11 statement that he and the government " are after the [ORG CIA  ] too , " Vice Minister of [ORG Social Movements  ] [PER Sacha Llorenti  ] announced on November 17 that the presence of [ORG CIA  ] agents is " prohibited " in [LOC Bolivia:  ] " there exists no norm that would allow the presence of those agents in the national territory and to verify their presence in the country would be a grave action against our sovereignty . 
" According to [PER Llorenti  ] , the government is investigating the possible presence of " external agents or of [MISC Bolivians  ] who serve external agents....the government is decided , and in this there will be no step backwards , on the dignification of our country and of its institutions . 
" - - - - Comment - - - - <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Morales  ] is already campaigning hard for both the constitution and his re-election , as can be seen by his standard attacks on the [ORG USG  ] . 
His rhetorical attacks have now led to the expulsion of both the Ambassador and the [ORG DEA  ] , and cannot be ignored as mere campaign stumping . 
[ORG USAID  ] could be next , as there have been repeated high-level attacks and social-movement calls for its expulsion . 
Morales' new focus on [MISC Bolivian  ] " co-conspirators " ( either police working with the [ORG DEA  ] or any political enemy [PER Evo  ] decides to describe as a [ORG CIA  ] collaborator ) will almost certainly instill fear among our contacts , who may become more cautious about meeting with us . 
His threat to expel the [ORG CIA  ] from [LOC Bolivia  ] means that any one of us can be ( mis ) identified as a spy and kicked out should we do--or be falsely accused of doing--anything that displeases [PER Evo  ] .
