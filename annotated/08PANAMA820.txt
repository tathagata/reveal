( U ) This cable contains sensitive proprietary business information concerning on-going negotiations . 
Please handle accordingly. ------- Summary ------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The [ORG Panama Canal Authority  ] ( [ORG ACP  ] ) announced on October 24 that the deadline for submission of bids on the contract for the third set of locks , centerpiece of the overall $5.25 billion [LOC Panama  ] Canal expansion , will be extended from December 10 , 2008 to March 3 , 2009 . 
This third delay marks turbulence in the bidding process for this mega-project and allows the [ORG ACP  ] to reconsider the key issue of the balance of risk between the [ORG ACP  ] and the consortia . 
Furthermore , the bidding consortia claim that the net effect of the [ORG Panama Canal Authority  ] 's ( [ORG ACP  ] ) 18 amendments to the original request for proposal added complexity to an already complex project . 
Despite the bidding complications , there is no indication of a decrease in the level of transparency and fairness in the process . 
While the [ORG Panama Canal Authority  ] ( [ORG ACP  ] ) enjoys a record of efficiently , safely , and profitably operating the canal and overseeing incremental improvements , constructing a project of this scope and complexity demands a different skill set and effective [ORG ACP  ] cooperation with its project management advisor . 
Regarding funding for the expansion , the Government of [LOC Panama  ] trumpeted its success in securing a $2.3 billion financing package despite construction cost estimates that exceed original projections. ------------------------- Expanding a [ORG Canal  ] is Hard ------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) [PER Jhan Schmitz  ] of the [MISC American  ] firm [ORG CH2MHill  ] , the [ORG Project Management Advisor  ] to the [ORG ACP  ] , stated on September 8 , " Nobody has done this ( the [ORG Canal Expansion Project  ] ) before , but all the pieces have been done before . 
" He noted that the coordination of all the contractors and the scale of the $3.35 billion project combined with the seven year construction timeline will be challenging . 
Although rolling gates have been constructed before , the scale is unprecedented . 
The design calls for 4,000 ton , 50 foot thick , 60 foot high rolling gates with a lifespan of 100 years that must move across 200 feet of water in ten minutes or less . 
The complexity of the expansion combined with the fact that the [ORG ACP  ] has never managed a multi-billion dollar project has created delays in the bidding process due to numerous amendments . 
While the [ORG ACP  ] does not have experience in mega-projects , the [MISC Panamanian  ] people and world-wide maritime transport industry recognize that the [ORG ACP  ] transparently and successfully operates the [ORG Canal  ] and implements incremental infrastructure improvements to the [ORG Canal  ] - see ref [PER C. -------------- Issues  ] of Risk -------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The [ORG ACP  ] will likely institute changes to its " draconian " " liquidated damages " clause , according to President of [MISC Bechtel Civil  ] , [PER Michael Adams  ] on October 5 . 
This view was confirmed in an October 20 conversation between Administrator [PER Aleman  ] and the Ambassador when the Minister stated the [ORG ACP  ] will review the full status of the bidding process to encourage participation of all consortia and to examine flexibility on the bidding deadline , the budget , and issues of risk . 
For the third set of locks contract , the original bidding documents placed every possible risk ( financial and technical ) onto the consortia . 
Subsequent amendments shifted some of the risk burden from the consortia to the [ORG ACP  ] , such as price escalation clauses for some construction commodities . 
However , the possible deal killer for the bidders remains liquidated damages - a specified amount of damages by a contractor for non-performance . 
For example , the rolling gates must close in 10 minutes . 
The liquidated damages clause , if enforced , would cost the winning consortium hundreds of millions of dollars if the gates close a just few seconds over 10 minutes . 
Usually , liquidated damages clauses apportion damages according to the severity of non-performance . 
There is no incentive if the gate is faster than the requirement . 
[PER Adams  ] stated the [ORG ACP  ] is creating an adversarial relationship and is fostering the conditions for future litigation. ----------------------------------------- [ORG ACP  ] Appears to Listen to Advisor 's Advice ----------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The [ORG ACP  ] and its project management advisor ( [ORG CH2MHill  ] ) are struggling over the control of the contracting process . 
The fierce independence and control of details that have made the [ORG ACP  ] an effective manager of the [ORG Canal  ] are impeding the management of the bidding process , according to [ORG CH2MHill  ] , which cautions that the project cannot continue to a successful completion on its current course . 
It appears that the [ORG ACP  ] is listening. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) In its most recent round of talks on October 9 , [ORG CH2MHill  ] representatives [PER Joe Cazares  ] , [ORG Canal Construction Advisor  ] , and [PER Michael Kennedy  ] , President of [ORG Transportation Business Group  ] report that [ORG CH2MHill  ] issued an " early warning notice " as specified in the contract between [ORG CH2MHill  ] . 
In order to correct the process , [ORG CH2MHill  ] outlined options for [ORG CH2MHill  ] to gain control of the contracting process . 
[PER Kennedy  ] told the Ambassador on October 16 that [ORG CH2MHill  ] would not walk away from the project , because that is " not who we are . 
" -------------------------------------------- Bidding Process - 18 Amendments and Counting -------------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The original specifications for the contract for the third set of locks , the primary contract of the expansion , were publicly released on December 21 , 2007 . 
To date , the [ORG ACP  ] amended the document 18 times , which is higher than the normal two or three modifications for a project of this complexity , according to [PER Schmitz  ] . 
The amendments resulted from the [ORG ACP  ] and the four prequalified consortia refining the original specifications . 
On the one hand , [ORG ACP  ] Administrator [PER Aleman  ] asserts the refining process provides " value engineering " - cooperatively designing plans with bidders ( which shifts extra costs to the bidders ) . 
[ORG ACP  ] Administrator [PER Aleman  ] in several meetings has stated that the process will reduce the likelihood of future litigation , improve the design , and achieve the best price for the [ORG ACP  ] . 
While meeting with [PER Aleman  ] on August 27 , a delegation of [ORG U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  ] ( [ORG USACE  ] ) personnel lauded the [ORG ACP  ] 's value engineering process as having the potential to be a model for extremely large [ORG USACE  ] projects in which there are only a few bidders in order to reduce the likelihood of legal disputes . 
On the other hand , the [ORG ACP  ] 's failure to incorporate " tracked changes " in over a thousand pages of specifications in each of the 18 amendments has created confusion , uncertainty , and deadline delays ( from August 22 to October 8 to December 10 and now to March 3 ) . 
Due to the delay , all four consortia are spending a million dollars per month , according to [PER Bechtel  ] ( one of the four prequalified consortia - see ref B for information on the four prequalified consortia ) and [ORG CH2MHill  ] Representatives. ------------------------------------------ [MISC Bidders' Dilemma  ] - Lowball , Value , or Punt ------------------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) [PER Adams  ] of [PER Bechtel  ] outlined three possible bidding strategies for [PER Bechtel  ] and the other consortia for the locks contact which the [ORG ACP  ] publicly expects to be $3.35 billion or less: bid lowball , bid value , or punt . 
-- Lowball Bid: [PER Bechtel  ] assumes that governments ( the [ORG ACP  ] is quasi-statal ) are only able to accept the lowest bid due to political reasons ; therefore , [PER Bechtel  ] must be the lowest bidder in order to win , regardless of their technical design . 
[PER Bechtel  ] anticipates that the " lowball strategy , " which would entail bidding low enough to win this highly prestigious contract yet not high enough to cover contingencies ( much less profits ) could lead to crippling losses . 
However , [PER Adams  ] believes that the two weakest consortia , [ORG Sacyr  ] led [MISC Spanish  ] consortium ( which is reportedly close to bankruptcy ) and the [MISC French-led  ] consortium , might lowball the bid with the intention of securing the contract and attempt to renegotiate the price during construction . 
[PER Bechtel  ] has been worried about this concern since April - see ref B . 
-- Value Bid: [PER Bechtel  ] bids what they believe is the proper cost of the contract to construct the third set of locks which is in the $4-8 billion range depending on which [PER Bechtel  ] official provides the number . 
[PER Adams  ] noted that traditionally [PER Bechtel  ] 's services are more expensive than its competitors , but that [PER Bechtel  ] finishes all of their projects and has high quality engineering . 
-- [PER Punt: Bechtel  ] decides that bidding on the locks contract creates too much risk for the company and bids $10 billion dollars . 
By putting in such a high bid , [PER Bechtel  ] would not expect to win the contract , but exchange ownership of [PER Bechtel  ] 's engineering plans for a several million dollar stipend from the [ORG ACP  ] and the right to walk away without any legal obligations. --------- Financing --------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) President [PER Torrijos  ] secured $2.3 billion in financing for the already initiated $5.25 billion overall [ORG Canal  ] expansion ( construction of the locks and related dredging and excavation projects ) ; the [ORG ACP  ] plans to fund the remaining cost out of its operating budget . 
During a October 14 press conference , [PER Torrijos  ] announced that five governmental financial institutions offered loans with a 20 year term with a 10-year grace period and an average annual interest rate of 5.49% . 
The lenders and amounts committed are: [ORG Japan Bank  ] for [ORG International Cooperation  ] , $800 million ; [ORG European Investment Bank  ] , $500 million ; [ORG Inter-American Development Bank  ] ( [ORG IDB  ] ) , $400 million ; [ORG Andean Development Corporation  ] , $300 million ; and [ORG International Finance Corporations  ] , $300 million . 
Minister of [ORG Canal Affairs  ] [PER Dani Kuzniecky  ] was pleased that the cost of financing fell below [ORG ACP  ] projections and that these lenders remained committed to the [ORG ACP  ] despite the on-going financial crisis . 
We understand that [ORG First Vice-President  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Samuel Lewis Navarro  ] told [ORG EEB A/S Sullivan  ] that President [PER Torrijos  ] wants to announce the consolidation of financing for the [ORG Canal  ] expansion at the December 9-10 Pathways to Prosperity Ministerial. ----- Price ----- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The $5.25 billion cost estimate for the [ORG Canal  ] expansion was established by the [ORG ACP  ] in 2005 when commodity prices , financial environment , and world economy were more favorable than they are at present . 
An [ORG IDB  ] independent consultant estimated the total cost to be $5.9 billion and [PER Bechtel  ] representatives believe the price could be $5.9 to $9.9 billion dollars if all risk in the locks contract is placed upon the consortia . 
The [ORG IDB  ] analysis of alternative scenarios for the [ORG IDB Loan Proposal  ] states that under the worst case scenarios the [ORG ACP  ] has a strong capacity to repay the outstanding debt due to its strong balance sheet. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) Post believes the bidding extension provides time for the [ORG ACP  ] , the [ORG Project Management Advisor CH2MHill  ] , and the consortia to iron out the fundamental issues outlined above . 
The [MISC Panamanians  ] realized that a project of this scope , complexity , and duration requires flexibility , even if that flexibility entails finishing the expansion beyond the summer 2014 deadline . 
It is noteworthy to mention that the announcement of the winner now likely will occur after the May 3 elections .
