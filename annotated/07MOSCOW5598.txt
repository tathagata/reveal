End summary . 
The Facts --------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Statistics of print and broadcast coverage devoted to political parties and politicians during the election campaign have been produced by multiple groups from across the political spectrum as well as non-governmental organizations . 
Taken together , a clear consensus emerges that [PER Putin  ] , his administration , and his party [ORG United Russia  ] receive the overwhelming majority of news and campaign coverage in the print and broadcast media . 
According to unpublished statistics from [ORG Transparency International Russia  ] , from September 1 to November 23 television and newspapers mentioned [ORG United Russia  ] nearly three times more ( 1371 mentions ) than Just [PER Russia  ] ( 490 mentions ) or the [ORG Liberal Democratic Party  ] of [PER Russia  ] ( [ORG LDPR  ] ) ( 437 mentions ) . 
The print media covered more parties than the broadcast media , although [ORG United Russia  ] still received double the attention given to any other party in the country 's national newspapers , taking one-third of the total print press political coverage. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG United Russia  ] also dominated the national television airwaves ; the opposition parties Union of [ORG Right Forces  ] ( [ORG SPS  ] ) and [ORG Yabloko  ] each received one tenth of the television coverage given to [ORG United Russia  ] ( 370 stories about [ORG United Russia  ] , and only 31 about [ORG SPS  ] and 36 about [ORG Yabloko  ] ) , according to [ORG Transparency International Russia  ] . 
A recent survey by the [ORG Center for Research  ] on the Political Culture of [LOC Russia  ] showed that [ORG United Russia  ] received -- on average -- 64 percent of the total political coverage on [MISC Russian  ] national television from November 1 to 13 , and up to 80 percent of the prime time coverage . 
The television dominance of the president , his administration , and [ORG United Russia  ] becomes clear when added together: according to the [ORG Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations  ] ( [ORG CJES  ] ) , it accounted for more than 86 percent of state-owned [ORG First Channel  ] 's evening news in October and November , 81 percent of state-owned [ORG RTR  ] 's coverage , 90 percent of Gazprom-owned [ORG NTV  ] 's political coverage , 77 percent of Mayor [PER Luzhkov  ] 's [ORG TV Center  ] 's coverage , and 54 percent of independent [ORG REN-TV  ] 's political coverage . 
Almost all of the coverage was positive ( with the exception of the arrest of Deputy Finance Minister [PER Storchak  ] and the [ORG REN-TV  ] broadcasts ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) According to [ORG CJES  ] statistics , November differed slightly from October , as some national networks aired news about parties other than [ORG United Russia  ] . 
The coverage , however , was almost universally negative: [ORG First Channel  ] devoted 0.8 percent of its political coverage to [ORG SPS  ] , and [ORG REN-TV  ] broadcast negative stories about [PER Putin  ] , members of his cabinet , [ORG United Russia  ] , [ORG LDPR  ] , the [ORG Communist Party  ] ( [ORG KPRF  ] ) and [ORG SPS  ] . 
[ORG REN-TV  ] 's audience share is small compared to the major networks , resulting in [MISC Russian  ] television viewers being fed overwhelmingly positive stories about [PER Putin  ] and [ORG United Russia  ] almost exclusively in October and November. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The political discussion on the internet has been more open , but [ORG Transparency International Russia  ] 's [PER Yelena Panfilova  ] claims that participants in the on-line political discussions are unlikely to vote . 
" Most of the people who vote don't read news on the internet , " [PER Panfilova  ] told us . 
She pointed to an on-line survey in which bloggers indicated that they were not inclined to go to the polls on December 2 as evidence . 
Kremlin Influence MOSCOW 00005598 002 OF 003 ----------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG United Russia  ] benefited from the president 's control of the government-owned media , particularly TV channels [ORG First Channel  ] and [ORG RTR  ] . 
[ORG NTV  ] 's news director [PER Petr Orlov  ] told us that [ORG NTV  ] had provided relatively little coverage of the election campaign , because ( 1 ) as a commercial station ( not directly state-owned ) they are not obligated to place paid political advertising , and ( 2 ) there was " no real debate or discussion " happening in the elections and therefore , [ORG NTV  ] 's viewers were not interested . 
[PER Orlov  ] conceded that the majority of [ORG NTV  ] 's political stories during news programs could be credited to [ORG United Russia  ] , but he claimed the amount of coverage was a trick of methodology . 
" If there is a four minute segment on health in [LOC Russia  ] , and the final 20 seconds is a quote from the head of the [ORG Duma Committee  ] on Health , who is a member of [ORG United Russia  ] , " [PER Orlov  ] said , " do you count four minutes or 20 seconds ? 
" [PER Orlov  ] told us [ORG NTV  ] is keeping its own accounting of how much time is given to politicians and political parties as they expect a spate of lawsuits after the [ORG Duma  ] elections. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG First Channel  ] 's popular anchor [PER Vladimir Pozner  ] was forthcoming in his assessment of why the television coverage is so skewed . 
He said that [ORG First Channel  ] 's Director , [PER Konstantin Ernst  ] , received several phone calls from the [LOC Kremlin  ] in November telling him to increase negative coverage of other parties , whereas in October he had been mostly prodded to provide positive coverage of [ORG United Russia  ] . 
[PER Pozner  ] pushed the envelope during this election season and [PER Ernst  ] instantly felt the sting: When [PER Pozner  ] told a joke on his weekly program about [PER Putin  ] and the [ORG CEC  ] 's support of [ORG United Russia  ] , [PER Ernst  ] received five angry phone calls from the [LOC Kremlin  ] telling him to pull [PER Pozner  ] 's show or edit out the joke . 
The show had been broadcast live ( and would rebroadcast later in the day to enable viewers in other time zones to see it ) , and so [PER Pozner  ] says he refused to edit the show and told [PER Ernst  ] that if his show was canceled , he would hold a news conference and make a big stink . 
[PER Pozner  ] believes himself to be a special case , and knows his actions jeopardize [PER Ernst  ] 's job . 
That , he said , is the only thing which keeps him from going " too far " on his show . 
He candidly told us that he does not see how [LOC Kremlin  ] influence and [MISC Russian  ] media self-censorship could get any worse than it is. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The [MISC Russian  ] Government is also forcing the state-run channels to air political advertising during prime viewing hours . 
According to [ORG NTV  ] 's [PER Orlov  ] , [ORG First Channel  ] 's [PER Ernst  ] complained during a media meeting with the [ORG Central Election Commission  ] that his channel hadn't been paid from the 2003 campaign , and was later " forced " to air 2007 advertising for [ORG United Russia  ] without any promise of payment . 
[PER Orlov  ] speculated that [PER Ernst  ] had relented because he had been threatened with losing his job . 
Self-Censorship --------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Not all broadcast outlets admitted to phone calls and [LOC Kremlin  ] instructions , and some suggested that such tactics are not necessary . 
TV Center 's [PER Mikhail Ponomarev  ] told us , " Our priority is [ORG United Russia  ] . 
If I do not cover them , I will be fired , and my successor will cover them . 
" [PER Aleksey Simonov  ] of the [ORG Glasnost Defense Fund  ] reinforced [PER Ponomarev  ] 's thesis that the media doesn't need instructions , because , " By now , everyone understands what to do . 
" According to [ORG CJES  ] Director [PER Oleg Panfilov  ] , many news editors rely on their own " sound " judgment when determining who to feature on their news programs . 
Of the national networks , only [ORG REN-TV  ] has slightly bucked the trend and produced its own political footage ( other channels often take prepared news reels ) on [ORG United Russia  ] , [ORG KPRF  ] , [PER Yabloko  ] , and [ORG SPS.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Aleksey Venediktov  ] , Editor-in-chief of the editorially independent radio station [PER Ekho Moskvy  ] , told us the [LOC Kremlin  ] complained about [PER Ekho  ] giving air time to opposition candidates . 
Since [ORG United Russia  ] prohibits its members from appearing on the station 's programs , [PER Venediktov  ] noted that the only people to talk to were from parties other than [ORG United Russia  ] . 
" They are afraid to come on our programs because we will ask them questions , " [PER Venediktov  ] told us . 
Local authorities recently closed the [PER Ekho  ] affiliate in [LOC Penza  ] until December 5 , citing " technical reasons , " but [PER Venediktov  ] said its [LOC Penza  ] affiliate had booked opposition candidates for programs , something the government didn't want to allow . 
[PER Venediktov  ] also noted that [PER Ekho  ] 's ratings had recently sky-rocketed , possibly owing to its independent editorial stance . 
Does it Matter ? --------------- [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00005598 003 OF 003 <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Media insiders are divided about whether any of this matters . 
[ORG NTV  ] 's [PER Orlov  ] told us it wouldn't matter if more coverage was given to smaller parties because politically active [MISC Russians  ] want to vote for winners . 
[ORG First Channel  ] 's [PER Pozner  ] claimed that more air time for all parties would lead to a real democratic competition . 
" This is not a popular election , " [PER Pozner  ] said , " it 's a selection by the media . 
" [PER Pozner  ] stated this has been common practice since 1995 , when ( then-President ) [PER Boris Yeltsin  ] had five percent popular support going into the 1996 campaign . 
[PER Pozner  ] recounted how then-media moguls [PER Vladimir Gusinskiy  ] , [PER Boris Berezovskiy  ] , and others , met in [LOC Davos  ] and decided to wage a media war on [PER Yeltsin  ] 's behalf because they could not accept that [ORG Communist Party  ] leader [PER Gennadiy Zyuganov  ] had 30 percent popular support . 
[PER Pozner  ] was adamant that if there was a level playing ground , [ORG United Russia  ] might not even exist . 
" Who are its members ? 
" he asked . 
" No one other than those in power . 
It has no broader party base . 
" <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Those we spoke with almost universally agreed that the media environment will get worse before the presidential elections in March , yet they all revealed a degree of uncertainty . 
[PER Venediktov  ] was characteristically nervous about [PER Ekho  ] 's future , saying , " These are dicey times . 
" [PER Orlov  ] is keeping his head down , and said [ORG NTV  ] is staying below the radar and away from unpleasant stories -- such as the November 24 - 25 demonstrations in [LOC Ingushetiya  ] ( reftel ) -- so as not to give the [LOC Kremlin  ] an excuse to crack down on them . 
Several regional newspaper editors shook their heads in bewilderment when we asked about the future . 
Conventional wisdom is that the government will wait until after the [ORG Duma  ] election to see how things come out , and then decide whether to be even more restrictive in its approach to the media in the run up to the presidential race .
