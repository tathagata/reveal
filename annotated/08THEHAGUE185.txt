( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] The [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MOD  ] is facing several defense issues leading up to and beyond the [ORG NATO  ] Bucharest summit in April . 
[MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MOD  ] senior leadership is facing criticism over the way it is handling the investigation into three possible friendly fire incidents in January . 
The [ORG MOD  ] continues to review a possible [MISC Georgian  ] contribution to its [ORG ISAF  ] extension in [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
Defense officials remain hopeful that funding can be found to allow the [MISC Dutch  ] to participate fully in the [MISC C-17  ] strategic airlift initiative , but are doubtful they will be able to sign the [ORG MOU  ] prior to the summit . 
Noise pollution associated with [MISC AWACS  ] aircraft at [LOC Geilenkirchen Air Base  ] continues to cause political problems for the [MISC Dutch  ] , who are looking for creative ways to address parliamentary concerns . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] also are looking to contribute 60 marines to the [ORG EU  ] mission in [LOC Chad  ] , although parliamentary support at this point is questionable . 
Finally , the [ORG MOD  ] is leading a 18-month long task force designed to examine the possibility of defense budget increases as a fixed percentage of GDP . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On February 26 , [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MOD  ] working level contacts discussed defense issues leading up to the [ORG NATO  ] Bucharest Summit in April . 
[MISC Dutch  ] participants included CAPT [ORG Turnhout  ] ( [ORG MOD  ] Policy Officer for the [LOC United States  ] ) , [PER LTC Parthesius  ] ( [MISC Dutch  ] military liaison for the [LOC United States  ] ) , and [PER COL Vermeij  ] ( acting head of the [ORG Joint Chiefs International Military Cooperation Directorate  ] ) . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] ----------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Vermeij  ] and [ORG Turnhout  ] addressed recent parliamentary and public criticism of [MISC Dutch  ] CHOD Gen. [PER Berlijn  ] 's interim report regarding three possible friendly fire incidents in mid-January . 
[PER Berlijn  ] 's report found that all three incidents were likely the result of friendly fire in which [MISC Dutch  ] forces did not " " fully comply in accordance with tactical procedures . 
" " Defense Minister van [ORG Middelkoop  ] is awaiting the results of a separate investigation by the prosecutor 's office before releasing the " " final " " [ORG MOD  ] report on the incidents in question. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Parliament and public criticism has lambasted [PER Berlijn  ] for issuing a report that is not yet final , while [MISC Dutch  ] troops in [LOC Afghanistan  ] are incensed the report does not take into account the " " extreme circumstances " " ( night time , inclement weather , lack of radio equipment ) under which the incidents transpired , and depicts [MISC Dutch  ] troops as " " rank amateurs . 
" " [PER Vermeij  ] argued that [PER Berlijn  ] and van [ORG Middelkoop  ] would equally have been criticized for " " keeping parliament in the dark " " if they had decided to wait until the investigation had been completed before releasing any findings -- essentially , the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MOD  ] senior leadership is " " damned if you do , damned if you don't . 
" " <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) On the possible [MISC Georgian  ] contribution to the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG ISAF  ] extension in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , [PER Vermeij  ] acknowledged the [MISC Dutch  ] are still determining whether they will be able to use the [MISC Georgians  ] , and expected an answer in three to four weeks -- any questions regarding potential [MISC Dutch  ] funding of task force training will have to wait until after the [MISC Dutch  ] assess whether the [MISC Georgian  ] offer was more than " " just a political facade " " to bolster [ORG NATO  ] membership action plan aspirations . 
He understood " " high interest " " in [LOC Washington  ] -- and potentially [LOC Canada  ] -- to use the [MISC Georgians  ] elsewhere should the [MISC Dutch  ] determine they are not a good fit for the [MISC Dutch  ] task force . 
[MISC C-17  ] ---- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG Turnhout  ] still expected the [MISC Dutch  ] to be able to participate in the [MISC C-17  ] strategic airlift initiative , but noted that funding remains an issue within the [ORG GONL  ] . 
He understood that the [LOC United States  ] and others seek to soon sign the [MISC C-17  ] [ORG MOU  ] so that it may be announced as a deliverable for the [LOC Bucharest  ] summit . 
[ORG Turnhout  ] said the timing is unfortunate for the [MISC Dutch  ] -- and for the [MISC Swedish  ] and [MISC Italians  ] for different reasons -- especially since the [MISC Dutch  ] will not be able to resolve their internal budget funding questions until after the summit . 
[MISC AWACs  ] Re-Engining ----------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG Turnhout  ] raised [MISC Dutch  ] efforts to reduce the noise pollution associated with [ORG NATO  ] Airborne Warning and [ORG Control System  ] ( [MISC AWACS  ] ) aircraft flying into and out of the [ORG NATO  ] air base just across the border in [LOC Geilenkirchen  ] , [LOC Germany  ] . 
He acknowledged that the " " business case " " to replace the noisy E-3 engines is proving difficult to make to [ORG NATO  ] Allies . 
As a result , the [MISC Dutch  ] have been forced to think creatively , including van [ORG Middelkoop  ] 's proposal at the [ORG NATO  ] Defense Ministerial in [LOC Vilnius  ] to replace 1,380 training sorties with a flight simulator . 
Unfortunately , [ORG Turnhout  ] doubted the [MISC Dutch  ] would receive an official answer from [ORG NATO  ] until the next [ORG NAMSO  ] board of directors meeting in June -- and the [ORG GONL  ] is on the hook to report to the [MISC Dutch  ] parliament by the end of March " " progress by [ORG NATO  ] " " on resolving the noise pollution . 
[ORG Turnhout  ] appreciated any assistance from [ORG NATO  ] Allies -- and the [ORG USG  ] specifically -- to indicate in advance that the flight simulator proposal might prove acceptable . 
[ORG Turnhout  ] also said that the [MISC Dutch  ] Minister for the Environment was taking a more proactive role on this issue , and has tried to gain support from other [ORG EU  ] environment ministers for the [MISC Dutch  ] cause . 
( Note: On February 21 , the [MISC Dutch  ] floated a paper at the [ORG EU Environmental Council  ] requesting [ORG EU  ] legislation assistance in restricting noise pollution associated with the [MISC AWACS  ] aircraft . 
End note . 
) [LOC Chad  ] ---- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Vermeij  ] noted that the [ORG MOD  ] has proposed contributing a reconnaissance unit of 60 marines as part of an [MISC Irish  ] battalion to the [ORG EU  ] mission in [LOC Chad  ] . 
He expected the Cabinet to approve the deployment on February 29 , followed by a parliamentary debate the following week . 
[PER Parthesius  ] confirmed strong opposition in both parliament and the military labor unions , noting the argument that the [MISC Dutch  ] military is already stretched too thin by its deployment to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
( Note: Members of the previous coalition government [ORG Liberal Party  ] ( [ORG VVD  ] ) approved the extension in [LOC Afghanistan  ] under the condition that no other significant [MISC Dutch  ] military deployment happen concurrently . 
[ORG VVD  ] traditionally has frowned upon [MISC Dutch  ] involvement in [LOC Africa  ] . 
End note . 
) [PER Vermeij  ] expected parliament to ultimately agree with the deployment given coalition party support for the mission , including especially efforts by the [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) to engage in [LOC Africa  ] . 
Defense Budget Review --------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG Turnhout  ] has been picked to lead the working level of an interagency task force to examine whether the defense budget should be structurally increased as a fixed percentage of the GDP ; the 18-month long task force will officially begin work on March 5 . 
[ORG Turnhout  ] explained that from the [ORG MOD  ] perspective , the aim of the task force is to lay the foundation necessary to effectively make the case to the next coalition government that the defense budget should be increased . 
He noted , however , that the issue is politically sensitive: the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] -- headed by [ORG PvdA  ] party leader [PER Wouter Bos  ] -- will argue in favor of decreasing the defense budget . 
He said the results of the task force will be highly scrutinized , and may carry significant weight in determine the future direction of the [MISC Dutch  ] military .
