REASONS: 1.4 ( B , D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) SUMMARY: There have been a few tentative steps on accountability for crimes allegedly committed by [MISC Sri Lankan  ] troops and civilian officials during the war with the [ORG LTTE  ] . 
President [PER Rajapaksa  ] named a committee to make recommendations to him on the [LOC U.S.  ] incidents report by April , and candidate [PER Fonseka  ] has discussed privately the formation of some form of “truth and reconciliation” commission . 
Otherwise , accountability has not been a high-profile issue -- including for [MISC Tamils  ] in [LOC Sri Lanka  ] . 
While [MISC Tamils  ] have told us they would like to see some form of accountability , they have been pragmatic in what they can expect and have focused instead on securing greater rights and freedoms , resolving the [ORG IDP  ] question , and improving economic prospects in the war-ravaged and former [MISC LTTE-occupied  ] areas . 
Indeed , while they wanted to keep the issue alive for possible future action , [MISC Tamil  ] politicians with whom we spoke in [LOC Colombo  ] , [LOC Jaffna  ] , and elsewhere said now was not time and that pushing hard on the issue would make them “vulnerable.” END SUMMARY . 
ACCOUNTABILITY AS A POLITICAL ISSUE ----------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Accountability for alleged crimes committed by [ORG GSL  ] troops and officials during the war is the most difficult issue on our bilateral agenda . 
( NOTE: Both the [ORG State Department Report  ] to [ORG Congress  ] on Incidents during the Conflict and the widely read report by the [ORG University Teachers for Human Rights  ] ( [LOC Jaffna  ] ) also detailed many incidents of alleged crimes perpetrated by the [ORG LTTE  ] . 
Most of the [ORG LTTE  ] leadership was killed at the end of the war , leaving few to be held responsible for those crimes . 
The Government of [LOC Sri Lanka  ] ( [ORG GSL  ] ) is holding thousands of mid- and lower-level ex-LTTE combatants for future rehabilitation and/or criminal prosecution . 
It is unclear whether any such prosecutions will meet international standards . 
END NOTE . 
) There have been some tentative steps on accountability on the [ORG GSL  ] side . 
Soon after the appearance of the [ORG State Department  ] report , President [PER Rajapaksa  ] announced the formation of an experts’ committee to examine the report and to provide him with recommendations on dealing with the allegations . 
At the end of the year , the president extended the deadline for the committee’s recommendations from December 31 until April . 
For his part , General [PER Fonseka  ] has spoken publicly of the need for a new deal with the [MISC Tamils  ] and other minorities . 
Privately , his campaign manager told the Ambassador that [PER Fonseka  ] had ordered the opposition campaign to begin work planning a “truth and reconciliation” commission ( ref B ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) These tentative steps notwithstanding , accountability has not been a high-profile issue in the presidential election -- other than President Rajapaksa’s promises personally to stand up to any international power or body that would try to prosecute [MISC Sri Lankan  ] war heroes . 
While regrettable , the lack of attention to accountability is not surprising . 
There are no examples we know of a regime undertaking wholesale investigations of its own troops or senior officials for war crimes while that regime or government remained in power . 
In [LOC Sri Lanka  ] this is further complicated by the fact that responsibility for many of the alleged crimes rests with the country’s senior civilian and military leadership , including President [PER Rajapaksa  ] and his brothers and opposition candidate General [PER Fonseka  ] . 
THE [MISC TAMIL  ] PERSPECTIVE --------------------- [ORG COLOMBO  ] 00000032 002.2 OF 003 <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) For different reasons , of course , accountability also has not been a top priority for most [MISC Tamils  ] in [LOC Sri Lanka  ] . 
While [MISC Tamils  ] have told us they would like to see some form of accountability , they have been pragmatic in what they can expect and have focused instead on securing greater rights and freedoms , resolving the [ORG IDP  ] question , and improving economic prospects in the war-ravaged and former [MISC LTTE-occupied  ] areas . 
Indeed , while they wanted to keep the issue alive for possible future action , [MISC Tamil  ] leaders with whom we spoke in [LOC Colombo  ] , [LOC Jaffna  ] , and elsewhere said now was not time and that pushing hard on the issue would make them “vulnerable.” <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) The one prominent [MISC Tamil  ] who has spoken publicly on the issue is [ORG Tamil National Alliance  ] ( [ORG TNA  ] ) [ORG MP  ] , self-proclaimed presidential candidate , and [MISC Prabhakaran  ] relative [PER M.K. Sivajilingam  ] . 
Breaking from both the [ORG TNA  ] mainstream and the pro-government [MISC Tamil  ] groups , he launched his campaign because he believed neither the government nor the opposition was adequately addressing [MISC Tamil  ] issues . 
[PER Sivajilingam  ] has focused on creating a de-centralized federal structure in [LOC Sri Lanka  ] with separate prime ministers for the [MISC Sinhalese  ] and [MISC Tamils  ] , but he also has spoken about accountability , demanding an international inquiry to get justice for the deaths and suffering of the [MISC Tamil  ] people. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) Other [MISC Tamil  ] politicians have not made public statements on accountability and are generally more pragmatic in their thinking . 
In our multiple recent discussions with [ORG TNA  ] leader [PER R. Sampanthan  ] , he said he believed accountability was important and he welcomed the international community’s -- especially the diaspora’s -- interest in the issue . 
But [PER Sampanthan  ] was realistic about the dim prospects for any [MISC Sri Lankan  ] government to take up the issue . 
Granting that governments in power do not investigate their own , [PER Sampanthan  ] nevertheless said it was important to the health of the nation to get the truth out . 
While he believed the [MISC Tamil  ] community was “vulnerable” on the issue and said he would not discuss “war crimes” per se in parliament for fear of retaliation , [PER Sampanthan  ] would emphasize the importance of people knowing the truth about what happened during the war . 
We also have asked [PER Sampanthan  ] repeatedly for his ideas on an accountability mechanism that would be credible to [MISC Tamils  ] and possible within the current political context , but he has not been able to provide such a model. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) [PER Mano Ganesan  ] , [ORG MP  ] and leader of the ethnic [MISC Tamil  ] [ORG Democratic People’s Front  ] ( [ORG DPF  ] ) , is a Colombo-based [MISC Tamil  ] who counts as supporters many of the well-educated , long-term [LOC Colombo  ] and [ORG Western Province  ] resident [MISC Tamils  ] , and was an early supporter of [PER Fonseka  ] . 
The general made promises that convinced him that if [PER Fonseka  ] were to win , ethnic reconciliation issues would then be decided by parliament , not the Executive President . 
On accountability , [PER Ganesan  ] told us that while the issue was significant XXXXXXXXXXXX accountability was a divisive issue and the focus now had to be on uniting to rid the country of the [MISC Rajapaksas.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) [ORG TNA  ] MP [PER Pathmini Sithamparanathan  ] told us in mid-December that the true story of what happened in the final weeks of the war would not go away and would come out eventually , but she also said now was not the time for war crimes-type investigations . 
Finally , on a recent trip to [LOC Jaffna  ] , [LOC PolOff  ] found that local politicians did not raise accountability for events at the end of the war as an issue of immediate concern , focusing instead on current bread-and-butter issues , such as [ORG IDP  ] releases , concerns about [LOC Sinhala  ] emigration to traditional [MISC Tamil  ] regions , and [LOC COLOMBO  ] 00000032 003.2 OF 003 re-developing the local economy . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) Accountability is clearly an issue of importance for the ultimate political and moral health of [MISC Sri Lankan  ] society . 
There is an obvious split , however , between the [MISC Tamil  ] diaspora and [MISC Tamils  ] in [LOC Sri Lanka  ] on how and when to address the issue . 
While we understand the former would like to see the issue as an immediate top-priority issue , most [MISC Tamils  ] in [LOC Sri Lanka  ] appear to think it is both unrealistic and counter-productive to push the issue too aggressively now . 
While [MISC Tamil  ] leaders are very vocal and committed to national reconciliation and creating a political system more equitable to all ethnic communities , they believe themselves vulnerable to political or even physical attack if they raise the issue of accountability publicly , and common [MISC Tamils  ] appear focused on more immediate economic and social concerns . 
A few have suggested to us that while they cannot address the issue , they would like to see the international community push it . 
Such an approach , however , would seem to play into the super-heated campaign rhetoric of [PER Rajapaksa  ] and his allies that there is an international conspiracy against [LOC Sri Lanka  ] and its “war heroes.” BUTENIS</pre></code>
