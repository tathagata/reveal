( [ORG SBU  ] ) Introduction: Following the exchange of Ambassadors in January 2009 , the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Libya  ] have embarked on a new period of engagement . 
With the restoration of full diplomatic relations for the first time in more than three decades , we are engaging [MISC Libyans  ] on a vast range of public diplomacy and democracy building initiatives , including education and [MISC English  ] language , human development , cultural outreach , entrepreneurship , and science and technology programs . 
These nascent programs are widely viewed by the [MISC Libyan  ] public as a sign of the mutual respect and partnership that are developing with the normalized relationship . 
The President 's June 4 speech in [LOC Cairo  ] added momentum to this new partnership , and many [MISC Libyans  ] welcome the change in rhetoric and policy included in that speech . 
However , the [MISC Libyan  ] Government remains extremely suspicious about some aspects of our public diplomacy and outreach programs and , in the past three years , has blocked some programs that included direct interaction with the local population . 
There is an influential group who oppose the process of normalization with the [LOC United States  ] and make their voices heard in decision-making circles . 
Although there has been a growth in " charitable organizations " in recent years , true civil society in [MISC Libyan  ] is nonexistent . 
" Non-governmental " organizations require Prime Minister-level approval to operate and retain close ties to the government ; many are chaired by close relatives of leading government figures . 
Both of these factors make it difficult for the Embassy to carry out the far-ranging , consultative process outlined in reftel , yet we seek every opportunity to engage our key partners in a discussion of [LOC U.S.  ] policy and initiatives . 
We are incorporating key aspects of the President 's [LOC Cairo  ] initiatives in our public diplomacy programming ; an outline of our specific ideas follows . 
We also note that normalization -- within the fullest legal extent possible -- of visa regimes and entry requirements for [MISC Libyan  ] citizens is necessary to convey and implement the full extent of respect and partnership laid out in the President 's [LOC Cairo  ] speech . 
End introduction . 
[ORG HUMAN DEVELOPMENT  ] 2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In the area of [ORG Human Development  ] and [ORG Rule of Law , Post  ] will assist indigenous non-governmental organizations calling for reform and greater transparency . 
Through capacity-building exercises and exchanges with [LOC U.S.  ] and international non-governmental organizations , [PER Post  ] will help [MISC Libyan  ] organizations develop the expertise required to effectively lobby and implement political and economic reforms . 
More specifically , [PER Post  ] will target its outreach on the development of linkages between [MISC Libyan  ] cadre and international professional associations such as the [ORG American Bar Association  ] . 
With [ORG MEPI  ] funding , [PER Post  ] was able to establish the [ORG U.S. Department of Commerce  ] 's [ORG Commercial Law Development Program  ] ( [ORG CLDP  ] ) in [LOC Libya  ] , working mainly with the General People 's [ORG Committee  ] for [ORG Justice  ] and the General People 's [ORG Committee  ] for Industry , Economy , and [ORG Trade ( Ministry of Economy-equivalent  ] ) . 
[PER Post  ] has facilitated three assessment and program planning trips for [ORG CLDP  ] staff to [LOC Libya  ] , as well as a visit by a [LOC U.S.  ] Federal Judge . 
[PER Post  ] will implement follow-up workshops with the judges in [LOC Libya  ] , a study tour for the judges to visit the [ORG Arbitration Center in Tunisia  ] , and a trip to visit the [LOC U.S.  ] Federal Judge at the [ORG U.S. Court of International Trade  ] in [LOC New York  ] . 
Proposals for future activities include: Fostering the creation of a [ORG Commercial Law Inter-agency Task Force  ] and providing training in safeguarding intellectual property rights of small- and medium-sized businesses . 
These programs will strengthen judicial independence and help develop a society that comes to respect the rule of law . 
Finally , [PER Post  ] will undertake specific programs to push [LOC Libya  ] to formalize and rationalize its policies regarding labor and migration management . 
We will focus our engagement on conducting workshops for policy makers to develop migration management , rationalize guest worker programs , increase law enforcement capacity to combat trafficking in persons and smuggling , and regularizing care for at-risk populations . 
[PER Post  ] also plans to increase its cooperation with the [ORG MEPI Regional Office  ] in [LOC Tunis  ] to expand programs in the areas of [ORG Pediatric HIV/AIDS Care and Treatment  ] programs , media development initiatives , and education system enhancement . 
We have found that soliciting [MISC Libyan  ] government requests and identification of various programs and needs through dialogue ensures better prospects for success . 
[ORG ENGLISH LANGUAGE  ] PROGRAMS 3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG English Language  ] Outreach has been one of our most successful initiatives in [LOC Libya  ] , and the way in which we have reached the most people with the least amount of host government intervention . 
[PER Post  ] will continue working with [ORG English Language Fellows and Specialist Programs  ] and will shift from government institutions to working directly with the ever increasing number [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000739 002.2 OF 004 of private language and training centers . 
Fostering this kind of people-to-people contact is at the heart of the President 's [LOC Cairo  ] message . 
We will continue to execute short term ( 2 to 6 weeks programs ) in [MISC English  ] language instruction that will focus either on direct [ORG English Language Instruction  ] or on Training Future [ORG English Language Teachers  ] . 
It is our goal to expand these programs beyond [LOC Tripoli  ] and [LOC Benghazi  ] into [LOC Southern  ] and [LOC Western Libya  ] , while especially targeting underprivileged minority groups . 
4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG ACCESS Micro-Scholarship Program  ] is designed to provide [ORG English Language  ] instruction to under-privileged children from 14 to 18 years of age with particular emphasis on underprivileged minority groups . 
Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] has implemented with tremendous success the [ORG ACCESS Micro-Scholarship Program  ] at the [LOC Success School  ] in [LOC Benghazi  ] . 
We will expand the program to two schools in [LOC Tripoli  ] and at least three schools in southern [LOC Libya  ] . 
Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] would like to double this program over the next four years ; with a goal of providing 100 scholarships per year by 2015 . 
EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL OUTREACH 5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Embassy continues to work to bridge the substantial gap created by the 24-year break in [MISC U.S.-Libyan  ] relations , and the most effective way to do this is to continue to focus on [ORG Exchange  ] and Speaker programs . 
[MISC Libyans  ] are slowly returning to the [LOC United States  ] for study , tourism , and business ; enthusiasm to do so is high , but [MISC Libyans  ] have little practical knowledge of [LOC U.S.  ] systems and practices , which vary considerably from those present in [LOC Libya  ] . 
Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] hopes to increase the number of participants in the [ORG International Visitors Leadership Program  ] , the [ORG Fulbright Foreign Student Program  ] , the [ORG Fulbright Foreign Language Teaching Assistant Program  ] , the [ORG Study of the U.S. Institutes  ] , and the [ORG Undergraduate Exchange Program  ] . 
6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) With the exception of [ORG English Language Specialists  ] , [PER Post  ] has been less successful in programming [MISC American  ] speakers and visitors in [LOC Libya  ] . 
Programs have been fully scheduled and then cancelled due to lack of support by the [ORG Government of Libya  ] by not issuing visas . 
Over Fiscal Years 2008 and 2009 , Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] had more than 15 [MISC American  ] visitors and speakers programs cancelled . 
[PER Post  ] will actively work to further develop its relationships with Government of [MISC Libyan  ] institutions in order to secure the support necessary to execute speaker programming . 
[PER Post  ] hopes to match the success of [ORG English Language Fellows and Specialists  ] in the fields of music , sports , education , archaeology , science , and technology and will leverage regional Speakers and programs planning to visit other posts in the [LOC Middle East  ] and [LOC North Africa  ] . 
EDUCATIONAL ADVISING AND INFORMATIONAL RESOURCE CENTER 7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Post  ] remains engaged in an active [ORG Public Diplomacy  ] program to re-establish a strong relationship between [MISC Libyans  ] and [MISC Americans  ] , to promote a positive vision of the [LOC United States  ] , and to cultivate common interests outlined in the President 's [LOC Cairo  ] speech . 
[PER Post  ] is actively engaged in the educational sector , working with the [ORG Government of Libya  ] to assist [MISC Libyans  ] who wish to pursue studies in the [LOC United States  ] and establishing relationships with local universities to conduct targeted workshops on the Test of [MISC English  ] as a [ORG Foreign Language  ] ( [ORG TOEFL  ] ) , [ORG Graduate Record Examination  ] ( [ORG GRE  ] ) , and the college and university application process . 
Compared to its small population ( around 5.5 million ) , [LOC Libya  ] has a large number of students studying overseas ( more than 30,000 ) . 
During the late 1970 's and early 1980 's there were more than 5,000 [MISC Libyan  ] students in the [LOC United States  ] . 
That number was reduced to almost zero during the sanctions period , but fortunately has seen large increases since the reestablishment of full diplomatic relations . 
8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to the [ORG Ministry of Higher Education  ] , there are now nearly 1,700 [MISC Libyan  ] students studying at [MISC American  ] Colleges and Universities and the [ORG Government of Libya  ] intends to increase that number to 6,000 through its own scholarship and grant programs . 
Due to suspicion on the part of the [ORG Government of Libya  ] , [PER Post  ] has had limited access to [MISC Libyan  ] students headed to the [LOC United States  ] . 
The absence of appropriate educational advising , cultural advising sessions , and pre-departure orientations has left many [MISC Libyan  ] students unprepared for their experience in the [LOC United States  ] . 
In academic year 2008-2009 , nearly one-third of all [MISC Libyan  ] students studying in the [LOC United States  ] returned without having finished the first year of their program . 
This is a problem of which the [ORG Government of Libya  ] and Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] are acutely aware , and through a campaign of sustained outreach to the [ORG Government of Libya  ] , [PER Post  ] has slowly gained access to students interested in studying in the [LOC United States  ] in the academic year 2009-2010 . 
In addition to [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000739 003.2 OF 004 Government of [LOC Libya  ] obstacles , the [ORG Public Affairs Section  ] currently has no publicly accessible space . 
By the end of this calendar year , the [ORG Public Affairs Section  ] will establish an [ORG Information Resource Center  ] which will give us greater access to students . 
Given the high interest in studying in the [LOC United States  ] , [PER Post  ] plans to hire additional staff members to provide regular educational advising sessions within the [ORG Embassy  ] 's [ORG Information Resource Center  ] . 
In addition to properly outfitting the [ORG Information Resource Center  ] , Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] will establish a network of [MISC American Corners  ] throughout [LOC Libya  ] that will serve as its regional outreach centers . 
The [MISC American Corners  ] will provide Education Advising and information on the [LOC United States  ] and will leverage current relationships with regional [MISC Libyan  ] institutions . 
Entrepreneurship . 
9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Within the area of Entrepreneurship , [PER Post  ] will train [ORG Corporate Boards of Directors in Strategic Planning/Roles and Responsibilities  ] to help facilitate the transition from public ownership to private management . 
[PER Post  ] will implement programs to train board members in free-market principles , business ethics , market strategies , and shareholder rights and responsibilities , all of which are essential to ensure a more transparent system . 
[PER Post  ] 's efforts to couple [MISC Libyan  ] organizations with international partners will help to raise awareness of anti-corruption programs and resources . 
10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) With [MISC MEPI  ] funding , the [ORG Financial Services Volunteer Corps  ] ( [ORG FSVC  ] ) conducted three professional workshops from Fall 2008 to the present , at the invitation of the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Central Bank  ] . 
The workshops covered Banking Supervision , Banking Controls , and [ORG IT Systems  ] for Banks . 
The Director of the [ORG Libyan Stock Exchange  ] met with [ORG FSVC  ] leadership in [LOC New York  ] in 2009 , and requested training for his staff , which has been scheduled in [LOC Libya  ] but is contingent upon [ORG FSVC  ] receiving the required [MISC Libyan  ] visas . 
[PER Post  ] has established a good track record in with entrepreneurial and banking programs in [LOC Libya  ] and we are well-poised to expand our training to include consulting in banking and securities regulations , and to assist with [LOC Libya  ] 's ongoing efforts to privatize its banking sector . 
11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Entrepreneurship programs for women and the expansion of economic opportunities for women remain two key areas for [PER Post  ] . 
[LOC Libya  ] remains a largely traditional society , with economic activity generally limited to male participation . 
As [LOC Libya  ] 's economy modernizes , it is crucial that women seize entrepreneurial opportunities and that frameworks exist by which women have equal access to finance and business-management technical assistance . 
Current data on the role of women in the commercial sector are incomplete ; an assessment will be necessary to determine which programs will be most successful . 
With [MISC MEPI  ] funding , [PER Post  ] will undertake a needs assessment on women economic activity and areas for improvement . 
[PER Post  ] has identified the [ORG Waatasimu Foundation  ] ( headed by [PER Aisha  ] al-Qadhafi ) and [ORG UNDP  ] as potential implementers of this proposed program . 
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As highlighted in the President 's [LOC Cairo  ] Speech , science and technology presents a unique opportunity for government to government cooperation , citizen exchanges , and capacity-building programs . 
[PER Post  ] , in combination with the [ORG Bureau of Oceans  ] , [ORG Environment  ] , and Science has very successfully engaged the [MISC Libyan  ] government in the area of science and technology . 
One of our most exciting and successful programs has been the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Space Camp  ] project where [PER Post  ] and OES combined to send twenty-four [MISC Libyan  ] high school students , two [MISC Libyan  ] teachers , and a professional [MISC Libyan  ] film crew to take part in [ORG NASA  ] 's [ORG Advanced Space Academy  ] in [LOC Huntsville  ] , [LOC Alabama  ] . 
The program was carried out under the [ORG U.S.-Libya Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement  ] , signed in January 2008 . 
At the [ORG Academy , the  ] students and teachers learned about the mental , emotional , and physical demands astronauts face and were able to see [MISC American  ] science and technology up-close . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] students and teachers represent the first group from [LOC North Africa  ] to attend [ORG U.S. Space Camp  ] , and only the second group from the [MISC Arab  ] world since 1982 . 
A film recording the students' experience at camp will be produced by a [MISC Libyan  ] film crew . 
The film will be shown on [MISC Libyan  ] television , in [MISC Libyan  ] classrooms , and throughout the region to spark an interest in science and discovery , demonstrate [LOC U.S.  ] goodwill , and inspire future participation in science and technology exchanges . 
Given the success of the program , [PER Post  ] intends to continue the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Space Camp  ] project and in the coming year will specifically target under-represented groups and non-traditional audiences for participation in this program . 
13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Post  ] and other local embassies built a partnership comprising members of the [ORG European Union  ] , private companies , the [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000739 004.2 OF 004 [ORG U.S. Government  ] , and the [ORG Government of Libya  ] to improve the quality of care and treatment for victims of [MISC AIDS  ] . 
Expanding these successes to the broader goals of infectious disease prevention and increased public awareness will improve the overall quality of healthcare , and provide much-needed professional employment for [MISC Libyans  ] entering the workforce . 
VISAS AND ENTRY PROCEDURES 14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) One aspect of the relationship that continues to present a significant obstacle to building full , flourishing people-to-people ties is the current restrictive visa reciprocity schedule and the additional procedures required for [MISC Libyans  ] upon entry into the [LOC United States  ] by the [ORG National Security Entry/Exit Registration System  ] ( [ORG NSEERS  ] ) . 
The lack of multiple-entry long-term visas in addition to the additional security and registration requirements are viewed by [MISC Libyans  ] as a symbol of a lingering lack of respect from the difficult days in our bilateral relationship . 
The current requirements allow little flexibility and result in even [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Government-sponsored  ] visitors being subjected to long delays for their travel and arrival . 
For example , the participants of [ORG Space Camp  ] missed an entire day of their exchange program due to a missed flight caused by a six hour [ORG NSEERS  ] registration process at the [ORG Atlanta International Airport  ] . 
A change in both the visa reciprocity schedule and [ORG NSEERS  ] registration process are needed in order to fully realize the President 's [LOC Cairo  ] goals of mutual respect , peace , advancement , and partnership . 
We are currently working with the [MISC Libyans  ] to establish a bilateral working group to liberalize both the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Libyan  ] visa schedules . 
COMMENT 15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Libya  ] has made great strides towards rejoining the community of nations by renouncing weapons of mass destruction and international terrorism and is a top partner in combating terrorism . 
However , years of isolation and stagnation have taken their toll . 
[MISC Libyans  ] must undertake significant political , economic , and civil society reforms , as well as the basic institution-building necessary to allow [LOC Libya  ] to make up for decades of underdevelopment . 
In February 2004 , [LOC U.S.  ] diplomats arrived back in [LOC Tripoli  ] ready to implement a wide range of programs in step with [MISC Libyan  ] actions to fulfill its commitments and reopen to the [LOC West  ] . 
The pace of reform has gone slower than expected and the reform process in [LOC Libya  ] will be generational . 
During that span , continued public diplomacy and assistance programming will be necessary to build the trust and cooperation necessary to achieve the objectives laid out by the President in [LOC Cairo  ] . 
Recognizing the extreme sensitivities on the part of the government to the kind of interaction we anticipate , the [MISC Embassy  ] will move forward in a deliberate but careful manner to ensure that the scope and intensity of our activities push up against , but do not cross , the red lines that are part and parcel of the political fabric here . 
The current controversy regarding the return of convicted [MISC Pan Am 103  ] bomber [PER Abdel Basset  ] al-Megrahi may impact on the short and near term prospects of [MISC Embassy  ] programs to affect the range of activities that we have laid out in this cable .
