End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
In a bid to solidify control of its extensive acreage holdings in [LOC Libya  ] , [ORG Occidential Petroleum  ] ( [ORG Oxy  ] ) is set to announce a 25-year extension to its contracts in [LOC Libya  ] . 
[ORG Oxy  ] 's CEO is expected to travel to [LOC Tripoli  ] during the week of November 25 to sign the new deal with the [ORG National Oil Corporation  ] ( [ORG NOC  ] ) . 
Under the terms of the extension , which has been under negotiation between [ORG Oxy  ] and the [ORG NOC  ] since January 2007 , more than a dozen contracts set to expire in the 2009-10 timeframe will be extended for 25 years past 2007 . 
[ORG Oxy  ] has agreed to pour more than $13 billion into exploration , field development and infrastructure upgrades as part of this arrangement . 
[ORG Oxy  ] will also reportedly gain additional production rights with its current NOC-owned partner [PER Zuetina  ] , as well as [LOC Sirte Basin  ] production from another [ORG NOC  ] company , the [ORG Arabian Gulf Oil Company  ] ( [ORG AGOCO  ] ) . 
The general terms of the new agreement will follow the [ORG NOC  ] template used in the most recent Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement ( [ORG EPSA  ] ) rounds , although there will reportedly be some flexibility on the terms of the production share of production that [ORG Oxy  ] will receive from future discoveries. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
This deal will solidify [ORG Oxy  ] 's position as one of the top , if not the top , international oil company ( [MISC IOCs  ] ) in [LOC Libya  ] . 
[ORG Oxy  ] resumed operations in [LOC Libya  ] in July 2005 , nineteen years after departing the country following its conclusion of a " standstill " agreement with [MISC Libyan  ] authorities . 
Thanks in part to its success in the January 2005 [ORG EPSA  ] bid round ( in which it won acreage in nine different areas ) , [ORG Oxy  ] is the largest net total of oil and gas acreage in [LOC Libya  ] , with a total exploration and production acreage in [LOC Libya  ] of approximately 130,000 square kilometers . 
[ORG Oxy  ] is both the largest holder of onshore acreage in [LOC Libya  ] , with over 30 million acres , and also has whole or partial interest over more than 12 million acres of offshore territory , which it either controls outright or as a 35% shareholder in partnership with [LOC Australia  ] 's [ORG Woodside  ] ( 55% ) and [ORG UAE  ] 's [PER Liwa  ] ( 10% ) . 
Also , although it subcontracts all of its field operations , [ORG Oxy  ] is one of the largest employers of [MISC American  ] citizens in [LOC Libya  ] , with anywhere from 15 to 20 employees at any given time . 
[LOC Libya  ] is a critical market for [ORG Oxy  ] . 
The company expended more than 70% of its worldwide exploration budget in [LOC Libya  ] in 2006 . 
The $13 billion work plan envisioned under this new deal will only increase [LOC Libya  ] 's importance to [ORG Oxy  ] .
