Brennan  ] for reason 1.4 ( d ) . -------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) " [LOC Ecuador  ] is causing instability for all [LOC America  ] " since it dropped its tourist visa requirements for all nationalities in June , according to [PER Mario Zamora  ] , head of the [ORG GOCR General Directorate of Immigration  ] ( [ORG DGI  ] , [MISC Spanish  ] acronym ) . 
[ORG GOCR Immigration  ] officials that traveled to [LOC Ecuador  ] in October reported that approximately 10,000 [MISC Chinese  ] had entered [LOC Ecuador  ] over the last four months . 
[PER Zamora  ] feared that these [MISC Chinese  ] were heading for [LOC Costa Rica  ] and for the [LOC United States  ] and that many could fall victim to forced labor trafficking or human smuggling " coyotaje . 
" Some had applied for [MISC Costa Rican  ] permanent residency in [LOC Beijing  ] and then asked that their notification be sent to them in [LOC Ecuador  ] , suggesting the beginning of an organized fraud pattern . 
[PER Zamora  ] told us that flights from [LOC Ecuador  ] through [LOC Costa Rica  ] ( a [ORG TACA Airlines  ] hub for flights headed north ) had become " very cosmopolitan , " and he feared an influx of irregular migration of [MISC Eastern Europeans  ] , [MISC Arabs  ] , [MISC South Americans  ] and [MISC Africans  ] . 
END SUMMARY. ------------------------------------------ CHINESE: INCREASED NUMBERS ; POSSIBLE FRAUD ------------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [ORG DGI  ] became concerned recently when officials noticed a pattern among non-related [MISC Chinese  ] " family reunification " residency petitions . 
Approximately 10 to 15 cases surfaced , involving young males aged 17 to 20 , in which the applicants filed petitions in [LOC Beijing  ] to come to [LOC Costa Rica  ] , but requested that status notifications be sent to [LOC Ecuador  ] . 
[PER Zamora  ] admitted that it did not make sense for [MISC Chinese  ] to await [MISC Costa Rican  ] residency in [LOC Ecuador  ] , and he offered as hypotheses that an organized fraud ring was smuggling or trafficking [MISC Chinese  ] , or that such a ring was arranging valid residencies for [MISC Chinese  ] but then using the documents for impostors waiting in [LOC Ecuador  ] . 
[PER Zamora  ] , following a policy of " caution and prevention , " dispatched two officials to [LOC Quito  ] last month to reinforce training for [ORG GOCR  ] consuls and to meet with [MISC Ecuadorian  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] officials . 
The [ORG DGI  ] halted the above-mentioned residency cases ; the applicants will have to reapply under tighter documentary requirements , including signatures of both parents on application forms , and [ORG GOCR  ] consuls in [LOC Beijing  ] and [LOC Quito  ] will take a closer look at the underlying [MISC Chinese  ] documents , such as birth certificates , for evidence of fraud. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) According to a [ORG DGI  ] report provided to us , [ORG Ecuadorian Immigration  ] Director [PER Luis Ordonez Sanchez  ] told the [ORG GOCR  ] [ORG DGI  ] that between June 20 and the October meeting , 10,748 [MISC Chinese  ] had entered [LOC Ecuador  ] and 4826 of those had departed , compared to 2007 statistics showing only 4776 [MISC Chinese  ] entries and 4417 departures . 
[PER Ordonez  ] reported that even with those statistics , it was too early to determine the positive or negative effect that dropping the visa requirement had , even though officials were aware that many of the [MISC Chinese  ] were looking to the [LOC U.S.  ] as their final destination . 
[PER Ordonez  ] said that the measure was designed to increase tourism , investment and trade , as well as to " increase the free movement of people into and out of the country . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) According to the [ORG DGI  ] report , in a separate meeting with [MISC Chinese  ] Political Counselor in [LOC Ecuador  ] [PER Gu Jiafeng  ] , [PER Gu  ] told [ORG DGI  ] officials that the majority of [MISC Chinese  ] who had entered since June 20 came from the poorest provinces , [LOC Fujian  ] and [LOC Guadong  ] , and the [MISC Chinese  ] government was concerned that they would fall victim to trafficking and smuggling rings in [LOC Ecuador  ] . 
[PER Gu  ] reportedly said that only a third had departed [LOC Ecuador  ] " regularly " and that the rest stayed in [LOC Ecuador  ] or sought to go illegally to [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Colombia  ] , [LOC Peru  ] or to their most desired destination - the [LOC United States.  ] ----------------------------------- FLIGHTS FROM [LOC ECUADOR  ] " [LOC COSMOPOLITAN  ] " ----------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Zamora  ] noted that daily flights arriving to [LOC San Jose  ] from [LOC Ecuador  ] had recently become " very cosmopolitan " and were receiving more scrutiny . 
Before , these flights carried more " local " clientele but now included many [MISC South Americans  ] and [MISC Eastern Europeans  ] , among others . 
[PER Zamora  ] explained that [LOC San Jose  ] is a hub for [ORG TACA Airlines'  ] northbound flights . 
The [ORG DGI  ] detected a pattern that these more " diverse " flights from [LOC Ecuador  ] were generally transiting [LOC Costa Rica  ] and headed to [LOC Guatemala  ] or [LOC Belize  ] - two countries with extremely porous [MISC Mexican  ] borders - as their final destination. -------------------------------------------- OTHER NATIONALITIES USING [LOC ECUADOR  ] AS BRIDGE ? -------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) According to [PER Zamora  ] , [ORG Ecuadorian Immigration  ] officials told [ORG DGI  ] officials that an unspecified number of [MISC Arabs  ] were now arriving in [LOC Ecuador  ] . 
Anecdotally , [PER Zamora  ] told us that he was concerned regarding [MISC Iraqis  ] , [MISC Afghans  ] and [MISC Iranians  ] transiting [LOC Ecuador  ] to [LOC Colombia  ] via land , moving to an unspecified destination " north , " who were caught and deported from [LOC Colombia  ] . 
[ORG Ecuadorian Immigration  ] told the [ORG DGI  ] that the administration 's decision to drop visa requirements came as a surprise to the [ORG Immigration department  ] . 
[ORG GOCR  ] consuls in [LOC Ecuador  ] reported an increase in all types of visa applications since June 20. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Lastly , [PER Zamora  ] expressed concern about a potential influx of [MISC African  ] migration to the region . 
Whereas before [ORG Brazilian Immigration  ] was an obstacle even though there were direct flights from [LOC Africa  ] , now [MISC Africans  ] could transit [LOC Brazil  ] and land in [LOC Ecuador  ] . 
From there , they could migrate over land. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) COMMENT: [PER Zamora  ] 's efforts at " caution and prevention " are welcome and are in keeping with his efforts to enforce [MISC Costa Rican  ] immigration law more vigorously and to work with regional counterparts ( and us ) more closely . 
We sense that his instincts are correct , and we appreciate his more " strategic " view of immigration throughout the region . 
Though [PER Zamora  ] told us that there had thus far been no indication that the emerging immigration patterns included terrorist activity , he remains attentive to [LOC U.S.  ] concerns , and he continues to work closely with us on these issues . 
We would be interested in Embassy [LOC Quito  ] 's /ConGen [LOC Guayaquil  ] 's read of the [MISC Chinese  ] immigration picture . 
Please advise .
