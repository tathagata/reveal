( C ) Summary . 
The [MISC Cuban  ] Government has been able to stonewall its independent civil society from foreign visitors who have , for the large part , been all too ready to give in to [MISC Cuban  ] bullying and give up on these encounters . 
A series of recent visits has shown the different approaches that foreign governments have taken to highlight , or not , [MISC Cuba’s  ] sorry human rights record . 
The [MISC Asutralian  ] Foreign Minister , [ORG Switzerland’s Human Rights Special Envoy  ] and the [MISC Canadian  ] Cabinet-level Minister of the [ORG Americas  ] not only failed to meet with non-government [MISC Cubans  ] , they didn’t even bother to publicly call for more freedoms after visiting [LOC Cuba  ] in November . 
Though also shunning [ORG NGOs  ] , recent emissaries from the [LOC Vatican  ] and the [ORG EU  ] , at least called out publicly for greater rights . 
Some holdouts remain , refusing to bring anyone of note if the [MISC Cubans  ] insist on conditioning access . 
Regardless of the approach , the result tends to be the same . 
There is little of substance to be gained from a “friends-at-all-costs” approach to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
End Summary . 
THE “BEST-FRIENDS-FOREVER” APPROACH: DO , SAY NOTHING --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Practitioners of this approach to [LOC Cuba  ] include most countries , including all [MISC Latin Americans  ] and [MISC Africans  ] , [MISC Russians  ] and [MISC Chinese  ] , and many [MISC Europeans  ] . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] Polcouns in [LOC Havana  ] best summed up this style: “We don’t raise ( human rights ) in public or private.” No wonder , the [LOC U.K.  ] number-two in [LOC Havana  ] grumbled , that “Cuba would love nothing more than to have the same relationship with us that they have with [ORG Brazil.” Most  ] of these countries would not raise human rights even if the Government of [LOC Cuba  ] ( [ORG GOC  ] ) did not object to them doing so . 
This group apparently now includes the [MISC Swiss  ] and [MISC Australians.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG Swiss Human Rights Special Envoy  ] [PER Rudolf Knoblauch  ] met with his [MISC Cuban  ] counterparts on November 12 , government-organized groups ( GONGOs ) and the [MISC Catholic  ] Cardinal . 
He did not meet with civil society leaders nor make any public reference to [MISC Cuba’s  ] human rights record ( “not the [MISC Swiss  ] way to do things , ” they told us ) . 
More surprisingly , however , the [MISC Swiss  ] admitted that [PER Knoblauch  ] did not raise [MISC Cuba’s  ] human rights situation in private . 
As part of the “Periodic Review , ” under their bilateral Dialogue , the [MISC Swiss  ] and the [MISC Cubans  ] discussed multilateral human rights issues , such as accession to international conventions and the [ORG UNCHR  ] , but did not touch upon [MISC Cuba’s  ] political prisoners , access to prisons or the still-unscheduled visit of the [ORG United Nations Special Rapporteur  ] on Torture ( Ref A ) . 
They invited [MISC Cuban  ] officials to tour [MISC Swiss  ] jails , something the [MISC Swiss  ] said “had worked” in their relations with [LOC Vietnam.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [MISC Australian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Stephen Smith  ] met with [MISC Cuba’s  ] Vice President [PER Jose Ramon Machado  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Bruno Rodriguez  ] on November 23 . 
According to [MISC Australian  ] press reports , [PER Smith  ] said how “pleased” he was with [MISC Australia-Cuba  ] relations and praised bilateral “friendship and cooperation , ” while [PER Rodriguez  ] thanked [LOC Australia  ] for its support against the [LOC U.S.  ] embargo at the [ORG United Nations  ] , the [MISC Cuban  ] press reported . 
Nothing was said in public about political or economic reforms , or human rights . 
THE “KEEP-IT-PRIVATE” APPROACH: SAY NOTHING PUBLICLY --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) It is hard to gauge how many countries really bring up [ORG HAVANA  ] 00000706 002.3 OF 003 the tough subjects when they meet in private with the [MISC Cubans  ] , but many claim to do so . 
Although nothing of substance stops visitors from engaging with civil society quietly ( the way , for instance , we managed to do with our [LOC U.S.  ] visitors in September , Ref B ) , most countries opt to shun meetings altogether , bowing to [MISC Cuban  ] pressure . 
[LOC Spain  ] falls mostly in this group , although to their credit , Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] spoke of the need for “gestures” after his meetings here in September . 
[LOC Canada  ] laid a claim on this group after the November visit of [ORG Americas  ] Minister [PER Peter Kent.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [MISC Canadians  ] also failed to meet with the independent civil society or make public pronouncements after the visit of Minister [ORG Kent  ] . 
This was surprising , since [ORG Kent  ] and Prime Minister Harper had been publicly critical of [MISC Cuba’s  ] human rights record , something that led the [ORG GOC  ] to cancel [ORG Kent’s  ] visit last April . 
[MISC Canadian  ] officials in [LOC Havana  ] told us that [ORG Kent  ] raised the issue of [MISC Cuba’s  ] political prisoners but that the [ORG GOC  ] had immediately turned the discussion into one of definitions . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The [ORG GOC  ] claims all of its prisoners of conscience are common criminals . 
Its stock answer to the topic is to deny it holds political prisoners . 
) It’s an interesting debate , our [MISC Canadian  ] counterparts claimed , “If someone takes money from the [LOC U.S.  ] , does that make him a political prisoner ? ” <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In his meetings with [MISC Cuban  ] Foreign Minister [PER Bruno Rodriguez  ] , [ORG Kent  ] reportedly asked also about the visit of the [ORG Special Rapporteur  ] , but again the [MISC Cubans  ] changed the subject. “How many [ORG Rapporteur  ] visits has [LOC Canada  ] had ? , ” [PER Rodriguez  ] was said to have shot back . 
[ORG Kent  ] left town saying little , a style that “works better for the ( [ORG GOC  ] ) , ” our northerly neighbors assured us . 
THE “WE-RESPECTFULLY-DISAGREE” APPROACH: GOING PUBLIC --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The missions that air their concerns publicly are in the minority . 
Although the official press ignores it , the [ORG GOC  ] frowns upon these utterances and often acts offended . 
[LOC Countries  ] that go public usually also meet with civil society , but others don’t . 
Outspoken visitors sometimes step out of their missions’ carefully managed talking points , as was apparently the case , for instance , of the latest high-level visitors to [LOC Cuba  ] from the [ORG European Union  ] and the [LOC Holy See.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [ORG EU  ] Commission in [LOC Havana  ] sits snuggly in the “Best-Friends-Forever” camp . 
Their functionaries share with us their reproach of the “radical” [MISC Swedes  ] and [MISC Czechs  ] , with their human rights priorities , and can’t wait for “moderate” [LOC Spain  ] to take over the [ORG EU  ] Presidency . 
The former Development Commissioner , [PER Louis Michel  ] , keenly followed that line during his visits to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Not so his successor. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) On an early November visit to [LOC Cuba  ] , the [MISC Belgian  ] [PER Karel de Gucht  ] put aside [MISC Cuban  ] equivocations and declared that “there is a set of fundamental rights that are universal , ” and called on [LOC Cuba  ] to “create the right conditions” to enact these rights . 
In respectful tones and emphasizing that the [ORG EU  ] was not after “regime change , ” [PER De Gucht  ] put the [ORG GOC  ] on notice that , if it did not begin to improve its human rights record , it could give up any hope of normalizing relations with the [ORG EU  ] . 
Despite this , in a November 23 interview with [ORG CNN  ] , de [PER Gucht  ] seemed to soften this line and called for normalization without demanding prior gestures from [LOC Cuba.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The [ORG Vatican’s Social Communications Council  ] President Archbishop [PER Claudio Cello  ] , a grizzled veteran of [MISC China-Vatican  ] negotiations , also mixed praise with tough love . 
Originally calling on the [ORG GOC  ] to allow further radio access to [MISC Cuban  ] churches , [PER Celli  ] went off script , and called on greater information and internet access for all [MISC Cubans  ] . 
He even [LOC HAVANA  ] 00000706 003.3 OF 003 singled out [MISC Cuba’s  ] blogger community for praise , something the [ORG GOC  ] “didn’t like at all , ” according to [LOC Holy See  ] diplomats in [LOC Havana  ] ( leading [PER Celli  ] to “clarify” his comments upon his return to [LOC Rome  ] ) . 
THE “TAKE-YOUR-VISIT-AND-SHOVE-IT” APPROACH: LITTLE LOST --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Some countries refuse to let the [ORG GOC  ] dictate to them when it comes to visitors . 
Although they will accommodate [ORG GOC  ] petulancy by hosting dual national day ceremonies ( and spare [MISC Cuban  ] officials the “affront” of sharing space with [MISC Cubans  ] it deems unworthy ) and cordon off their ambassadors from civil society engagement , the holdout countries resist pressure to disengage from civil society altogether . 
In many cases they have chosen to keep their principals at home if the price is kowtowing to the [ORG GOC  ] . 
[LOC Germany  ] , the [LOC Czech Republic  ] and the [LOC United Kingdom  ] may pay a price in terms of lost business and access from their principled stance . 
Others who stand in this camp have less to lose from sticking it to the [MISC Cubans  ] , and include [LOC Poland  ] and [LOC Sweden.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) In November , the Ambassador for the [ORG Order of Malta  ] ( a [MISC Catholic  ] church [ORG NGO  ] given diplomatic status by the [ORG GOC  ] ) took the “take-it-and-shove” it approach to new heights . 
After the [ORG GOC  ] told him that he could only bring in the [MISC Belgian  ] Ambassador ( firmly in the “BFF” camp ) but not the USINT Chief of Mission to a humanitarian event he was organizing at a leper hospital , he cancelled the event and left town. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) COMMENT . 
The [LOC Cuba  ] overwhelming majority of the 100 foreign missions in [LOC Havana  ] do not face a human rights dilemma in their dealings with the [MISC Cubans  ] . 
These countries wouldn’t raise the issue anyway . 
The rest , a group that includes most of [LOC Europe  ] , [LOC Canada  ] , [LOC Australia  ] , [LOC Japan  ] and the [LOC United States  ] , claim to employ different approaches to address their human rights concerns in [LOC Cuba  ] -- but the truth is that most of these countries do not press the issue at all in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
The [ORG GOC  ] does not like to talk about its human rights situation , and even less to be lectured publicly . 
It deploys considerable resources to bluff and bully many missions and their visitors into silence . 
For the most part the rewards for acquiescing to [ORG GOC  ] demands are risible: pomp-full dinners and meetings and , for the most pliant , a photo-op with one of the [PER Castro  ] brothers . 
In terms of substance or economic benefits , they fare little better than those who stand up to the [ORG GOC  ] .
