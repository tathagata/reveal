( C ) On August 22 , Ambassadors [PER Eikenberry  ] , [PER Holbrooke  ] , and [PER Ricciardone  ] met with [ORG UNAMA SRSG Kai Eide  ] , DSRSG [PER Peter Galbraith  ] , and [ORG UNDP  ] Chief [ORG Electoral Advisor  ] [PER Margie Cook  ] . 
The focus of the meeting was scenario planning for the outcome of the election results . 
Principals exchanged views on the outcomes that were likely in terms of the two key candidates . 
They noted that the two rationales that would likely be used by the leading candidate camps to challenge the legitimacy of the elections would be fraud and the disenfranchisement of [MISC Pashtuns  ] . 
While there are various accounts of voter turnout in [LOC Pashtun  ] areas , the general view is that the numbers were far lower than in the rest of the country. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) S/SRAP [PER Holbrooke  ] , evaluating the prospect of the election being stolen through fraudulent behavior , expressed concern that this would undermine the legitimacy of the government and paralyze it from carrying out the priorities the government urgently needs to address . 
[PER Ms. Cook  ] noted that fraud had already been detected , including in the [LOC Pul-e-Charkhi  ] area of [LOC Kabul  ] where ballot boxes had been stuffed days before the elections . 
[ORG UNDP  ] and [ORG IEC  ] have already decided to nullify these ballots , she reported . 
She expected fraud occurred in a number of insecure areas of the country . 
[PER Ms. Cook  ] reassured the group that there were seven different trigger points in the IEC’s tally process to detect fraud and expressed confidence that this process could quarantine and make void fraudulent ballots , even those from insecure areas . 
She expressed confidence that the [ORG ECC  ] would have the will to disqualify a large percentage of votes , even if there would be significant political consequences. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The principals agreed that it was important not to say anything publicly about the probability of either [PER Hamid Karzai  ] or [PER Abdullah Abdullah  ] securing the “50 plus one” percentage of votes necessary for a first round win . 
There was general concern about one of the campaigns preemptively declaring victory and potentially setting off a chain of disruptive events as witnessed in [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Kenya  ] , or [LOC Zimbabwe  ] . 
There was particular concern that one of the candidate’s supporters might orchestrate protests and unrest in the major provincial centers . 
There was concurrence about the importance of stressing to all of the major candidates that they should not make announcements claiming victory until the results were announced by the [ORG IEC  ] and that they would respect the process . 
Ambassador [PER Holbrooke  ] noted that he would stress this point with all three candidates. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The meeting participants also agreed that it was important to ensure the Chairperson of the [ORG IEC  ] not make any predictions about the outcome of the elections until the preliminary results were announced . 
It was agreed that Ambassador ( Ret . 
) [PER Tim Carney  ] would visit Dr. [PER Ludin  ] to reinforce the point that he should stay on message for the sake of integrity of the process . 
( Note: Amb . 
[PER Carney  ] delivered this message on August 24 . 
End Note . 
) [PER Ms. Cook  ] expressed concern that [ORG IEC  ] Chairman [PER Ludin  ] had indicated to the press that he would start providing some details of results elections on August 22 and she opined it would take at least until August 25 for enough information to be collected to make a correct preliminary partial announcement . 
The [ORG IEC  ] now plans to announce partial preliminary results , perhaps of ten percent of the tally , late afternoon of August 25 .
