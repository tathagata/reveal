( C ) Summary: A delegation of [MISC Dutch  ] parliamentary [ORG Defense Committee  ] members intends to keep an " " open mind " " during their upcoming " " fact-finding " " trip to [LOC Washington  ] and Ft . 
Worth to discuss the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) program . 
Parliamentary supporters and critics alike voiced concerns during an August 14 lunch with the Ambassador , including the [LOC U.S.  ] political commitment to the program and affiliated budget discussions , technology transfer issues , prospects for [MISC Dutch  ] business , defense acquisition priorities , the unit price of the aircraft , other technology advances such as unmanned aerial vehicles , and the creation of a " " maintenance valley " " in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] met August 14 for lunch with members of the Parliamentary [ORG Defense Committee  ] delegation traveling to [LOC Washington  ] and Ft . 
Worth on Aug. 27-30 to discuss the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) program . 
In attendance for the [MISC Dutch  ] were Parliamentary [ORG Defense Committee Chair  ] [PER Nebahat Albayrak  ] ( [ORG Labor Party  ] ) , [PER Luk Blom  ] ( [ORG Labor  ] ) , [PER Mat Herben  ] ( [ORG List Pim Fortuyn  ] ) , and [PER Gonnie de Boer  ] ( [ORG Defense Committee  ] staffer ) . 
[PER Roland Kortenhorst  ] ( [PER Christian Democrats  ] ) , and [MISC Willibrord  ] van [PER Beek  ] and [PER Zsolt Szabo  ] ( [ORG VVD  ] ) also will participate in the trip , but were not able to attend the lunch . 
[LOC U.S.  ] attendees included ODC Chief COL [PER David Kelly  ] and polmiloff [PER Jason Grubb.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Amb . 
[PER Arnall  ] stressed that the purpose of the lunch was to sound out parliamentary concerns in order to ensure [LOC Washington  ] and [ORG Lockheed Martin  ] were prepared to answer their questions during their upcoming trip . 
[PER Albayrak  ] noted that the delegation was maintaining an " " open-mind , " " and hoped to use the trip as a fact-finding mission in order to arrive at " " well-informed " " positions on the program . 
She explained that [ORG JSF  ] is a somewhat controversial issue , as it will be discussed in the campaign leading up to the parliamentary elections scheduled for November 22 . 
She added that while delegation members [PER Kortenhorst  ] , [PER Szabo  ] , and van [PER Beek  ] could not attend the meeting , the two extremes of those supporting and opposing the mission were represented in the attendance of [PER Herben  ] and [PER Blom  ] . 
( [PER Note: Szabo  ] , van [PER Beek  ] , and [PER Kortenhorst  ] support the [ORG JSF  ] program . 
End note . 
) Supporter 's Concerns -------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Herben  ] stressed that he was a strong supporter of the [ORG JSF  ] program , noting that he had voted in favor of it twice -- " " no one doubts that [ORG JSF  ] is the best bang for the buck , " " he said . 
He believed that the program was " " healthy , " " and would benefit the [MISC Dutch  ] . 
He added that he was in favor of signing the follow-on [ORG MOU  ] in the near future . 
However , [PER Herben  ] said he did have some concerns -- most of them related to the [LOC U.S  ] political process . 
He described various [ORG JSF  ] budget discussions in [ORG Congress  ] and the deliberation over the second , back-up engine as vexing -- he hoped to receive a strong indication during meetings in [LOC Washington  ] that the [ORG USG  ] was strongly committed to the program . 
He also raised the issue of technology transfer -- like the [LOC United Kingdom  ] , the [LOC Netherlands  ] would like access to technology such as strategic software , [PER Herben  ] said . 
Critic 's Questions ------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Blom  ] presented a critical assessment of the program . 
While he agrees [ORG JSF  ] is the " " best plane for the best price , " " he said his [ORG Labor Party  ] would prefer to buy the plane off the shelf rather than participate further in the program . 
In his mind , he sees " " too many red stop lights " " in the program -- these concerns could be turned to " " orange or even green , " " but for now , he advocates leaving the program . 
Several concerns that he hoped would be addressed during the trip included: -- Prospects for [MISC Dutch  ] business: [PER Blom  ] argued that [MISC Dutch  ] industry had not received enough contracts to warrant further participation in the program . 
He dismissed claims that non-participation in the program would signify the demise of the [MISC Dutch  ] aerospace industry , and noted that most contracts were going to [MISC Dutch  ] industrial giant [ORG Stork  ] rather than [MISC Dutch  ] small- and medium-sized businesses . 
Amb . 
[PER Arnall  ] and COL [PER Kelly  ] noted that [ORG Stork  ] had subcontracted out to 40 [MISC Dutch  ] industries , laboratories , and technical universities . 
Nevertheless , [PER Blom  ] said " " if you want to change my mind , then give us more contracts , " " and claimed that participation in the program thus far has not generated any new additional jobs for [MISC Dutch  ] industry . 
-- [ORG Strategic Defense: Blom  ] noted that the [ORG Labor Party  ] supported [MISC Dutch  ] military deployments to [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and will likely support future deployments overseas to places like [LOC Africa  ] . 
He questioned , however whether the [ORG JSF  ] was the weapons system needed for such missions , or whether it made more sense to continue to upgrade the [MISC Dutch  ] F-16s for a number of years , and spend money now on transport and armored vehicles . 
He reiterated that he supports buying [ORG JSF  ] aircraft , but said the [ORG GONL  ] must prioritize , and other needs should come first at the expense of [ORG JSF  ] . 
-- Technology transfer issues: [PER Blom  ] repeated arguments made by [PER Herben  ] that the [MISC Dutch  ] should be granted access to critical program technologies like strategic software . 
-- [ORG Aircraft Unit Price: Blom  ] said he has repeatedly asked [ORG USG  ] and [ORG Lockheed Martin  ] representatives for the unit price of the plane , and has been told " " not to worry " " as the price of the plane will be approximately 40-50 million euros . 
[PER Blom  ] questioned whether this was accurate , especially as earlier line versions of the aircraft are estimated to be three times more expensive , and pointed to similar conclusions in a General [PER Accounting Office  ] ( [ORG GAO  ] ) report . 
He has asked frequently for the " " end of the road , " " " " not to exceed " " ( [ORG NTE  ] ) cost of the plane -- " " just tell me the ceiling , " " [PER Blom  ] said . 
-- Other technological advances: [PER Blom  ] noted new advances in unmanned aerial vehicles ( [MISC UAVs  ] ) might suggest that the [MISC Dutch  ] delay or even forego purchasing [ORG JSF  ] . 
[PER Polmiloff  ] said the delegation would receive a brief in [LOC Washington  ] making clear that [MISC UAVs  ] were complimentary to -- but could not replace -- manned systems . 
Maintenance Valley ; [ORG Grippen Fighter  ] ? ------------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Albayrak  ] suggested that the program was more complicated than just a [MISC Dutch-U.S.  ] bilateral issue , and pointed to [MISC Dutch  ] discussions with other [MISC European  ] partners to potentially form a [MISC European  ] footprint " " maintenance valley " " in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
[PER Blom  ] and [PER Albayrak  ] acknowledged that a maintenance valley could be a factor in determining whether the [ORG Labor Party  ] could support the [ORG JSF  ] program . 
However , [PER Blom  ] questioned what the maintenance valley would entail . 
He argued that a facility focused on just engine maintenance and sustainment might mean an additional 300 new jobs for the [LOC Netherlands  ] , and therefore not worth continued [MISC Dutch  ] participation in the program . 
However , if the facility were to involve development and production of the second back-up engine , then this might mean an additional 1,500-2,000 jobs -- this would be hard to ignore . 
[PER Albayrak  ] also said that [MISC Dutch  ] parliamentarians are interested in discussions with [LOC Norway  ] regarding a new [ORG Grippen  ] " " [MISC Nordic  ] " " fighter , and asked if the technical air optimization report would be released by the end of 2006 . 
[ORG Transatlantic Ties  ] ------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) While [PER Herben  ] agreed that [ORG JSF  ] program participation exceeded just the [MISC U.S.-Dutch  ] relationship , he nevertheless pointed to the program 's significance to the transatlantic relationship . 
[PER Blom  ] stressed that he was a strong proponent of transatlantic ties , and said his opposition to the [ORG JSF  ] program should not cast any doubts in that regard . 
Interpreter Requested --------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) [PER Blom  ] noted that his [MISC English  ] was perhaps not as strong as other delegation members . 
Given the importance of the trip , he asked if it might be possible for an interpreter to be available during the delegation 's meetings .
