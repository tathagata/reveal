Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The [MISC Serbian  ] government continues to publicly emphasize its efforts to capture war crimes indictee [PER Ratko Mladic  ] , and [MISC Serbian  ] officials responsible for cooperation with the [ORG International Criminal Tribunal  ] for the [LOC Former Yugoslavia  ] ( [ORG ICTY  ] ) privately tell us the current government is very supportive of their work . 
[ORG ICTY Belgrade  ] , s chief , who sits in on operations discussions , agreed that [LOC Serbia  ] was looking hard for [PER Mladic  ] and was also providing all document and witness assistance required , in contrast to the previous government , s efforts . 
[LOC Serbia  ] also continued to prosecute domestic war crimes cases , and the war crimes court recently issued verdicts and sentences in two high-profile cases . 
The current government clearly wants to find [PER Mladic  ] , a prerequisite for moving ahead with [ORG EU  ] accession and [LOC Serbia  ] , s future . 
End Summary . 
Looking for [PER Mladic  ] ------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) With the upcoming visit of [ORG ICTY  ] Chief Prosecutor [PER Serge Brammertz  ] , the main question regarding [LOC Serbia  ] , s [ORG ICTY  ] cooperation -- and the key to the [MISC Dutch  ] unblocking [LOC Serbia  ] , s frozen [ORG Stabilization and Association Agreement  ] ( [ORG SAA  ] ) with the [ORG EU  ] -- is whether [LOC Serbia  ] is really doing all it can to find the remaining two [ORG ICTY  ] indictees , particularly [MISC Bosnian Serb  ] wartime military leader [PER Ratko Mladic  ] . 
Government officials continue to state publicly that [LOC Serbia  ] is making every effort to find [PER Mladic  ] and fellow indictee [PER Goran Hadzic  ] . 
Chief of the [ORG War Crimes Investigation  ] police [PER Aleksandar Kostic  ] told visiting [MISC S/WCI  ] representative [PER Julie Vibul-Jolles  ] May 5 that the current government had the will to find the fugitives , but that so much time had passed that it was hard to track them down . 
He said there was no information to suggest [PER Mladic  ] was in [LOC Serbia  ] but there was no information that he was anywhere else either . 
Police continued to search for leads , including surveilling known associates and family members . 
Regional intelligence sharing was helpful and had led to the arrests of [PER Stojan Zupljanin  ] and [PER Radovan Karadzic  ] , [PER Kostic  ] said. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG ICTY Belgrade Office Head  ] [PER Deyan Mihov  ] told us May 5 that he believed that the search for [PER Mladic  ] was very active . 
The current government was engaged with [ORG ICTY  ] , a “big change compared to the past.” [PER Mihov  ] said the [ORG Security Information Agency  ] ( [ORG BIA  ] ) and [ORG Military Intelligence Agency  ] ( [ORG VBA  ] ) were now working well together and supporting each other , s efforts . 
[PER Mihov  ] said he attends weekly meetings of the [ORG Action Team  ] as an observer and receives detailed operational information and plans concerning the search for both fugitives . 
[PER Mihov  ] told us that the meetings of the [ORG Action Team  ] , which was officially co-headed by President of the [ORG National Council for Cooperation  ] with the [ORG Hague Tribunal Rasim Ljajic and War Crimes Prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic  ] , were really led by Presidential Chief of Staff and [ORG National Security Council  ] Secretary [PER Miki Rakic  ] , which he viewed as a strong indication that the search for [PER Mladic  ] was a personal priority of President [PER Tadic  ] . 
[PER Mihov  ] said [PER Rakic  ] had provided the same information to [PER Brammertz  ] each time he visited and also requested [PER Brammertz  ] , s help obtaining specific intelligence assistance . 
[PER Mihov  ] emphasized that the government could use any additional intelligence assistance the [LOC U.S.  ] could provide . 
[PER Mihov  ] said he was impressed that the [ORG Action Team  ] was trying equally hard to find [PER Hadzic  ] , even though the political payoff for [LOC Serbia  ] from his capture would be much less than for [PER Mladic  ] . 
[ORG Technical Cooperation  ] with [ORG ICTY  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Serbia  ] , s technical cooperation with the [ORG ICTY  ] , while not as high-profile , is also essential . 
Director of the [ORG ICTY Cooperation Council Office  ] [PER Dusan Ignjatovic  ] told us May 4 his office had granted all of [ORG ICTY  ] , s and defense lawyers , archive access requests , delivered all subpoenas to witnesses , addressed all witness protection issues [ORG ICTY  ] had identified , and complied with more than 98% of document requests . 
[PER Mihov  ] confirmed that technical cooperation was close to 100% with no outstanding problems over documents , another improvement over the past government . 
Domestic Trials ---------------- [LOC BELGRADE  ] 00000399 002 OF 002 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Domestic war crimes trials also continue , with verdicts recently in two high-profile cases . 
[ORG War Crimes Prosecutor Vukcevic  ] told us May 5 the current government was much more supportive of domestic war crimes trials . 
On April 23 , the court convicted four former policemen for murdering 50 ethnic [MISC Albanian  ] civilians in [LOC Suva Reka  ] , [LOC Kosovo  ] in March 1999 . 
Two of the defendants were sentenced to 20 years in prison , one to 15 years , and the fourth to 13 years . 
Three of the defendants , including the principal defendant , were acquitted . 
[ORG Vukcevic  ] told us that he was pleased that the case had established that a crime had been committed but that he would appeal the acquittals . 
The [ORG War Crimes Court  ] also completed on March 12 a retrial in the [ORG Ovcara  ] ( [ORG Vukovar  ] ) case , convicting 13 members of the [ORG Vukovar Territorial Defense  ] for torturing and killing in November 1991 200 [MISC Croatian  ] prisoners of war who had surrendered . 
Five individuals were acquitted , and one received a much lighter sentence in the retrial ( 6 years versus the original 15 ) , and the [ORG War Crimes Prosecutor  ] , s spokesman announced the prosecutor would appeal that sentence and the acquittals . 
Comment ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In contrast to the approach of the previous government , the current [MISC Serbian  ] government is working hard on [ORG ICTY  ] cooperation . 
The pressing domestic political need to unblock the [ORG SAA  ] and move closer to [ORG European Union  ] membership is clearly a major motivating factor , made all the more important by the worsening economic situation . 
While the term “fully cooperating” may be elusive , it is important to acknowledge the current government’s efforts and not allow the dead weight of the past to hinder [LOC Serbia  ] , s future .
