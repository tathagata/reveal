( C ) After multiple extensions to the bid deadline ( now at March 3 , 2009 ) and soon-to-be 19 amendments fo the contract for the third set of locks of the [ORG Panama Canal  ] expansion , [ORG Bechtel  ] and [ORG ACS  ] , a [MISC Spanish  ] led consortium , have expressed concern about the [ORG Panama Canal Authority  ] 's ( [ORG ACP  ] ) ability to complete the bidding process in a fully successful manner . 
According to these two consortia , the extensions , along with the [ORG ACP  ] 's continuing failure to conclusively address risk allocation issues , have diminished confidence in a successful outcome to the bidding process . 
Additionally , while the [ORG Panama Canal  ] expansion remains a high prestige project , members of the consortia and potential suppliers may begin to turn to more lucrative projects. ---------------------------------------- Diminished Confidence in Bidding Process ---------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Due to repeated extensions in the bid deadline and the [ORG ACP  ] 's unwillingness or inability to seriously address risk issues , [ORG Bechtel  ] and [ORG ACS  ] , the two most capable prequalified bidding consortia , have diminished confidence in a successful outcome of the [ORG ACP  ] bidding process for the contract for the third set of locks , centerpiece of the overall $5.25 billion [ORG Panama Canal  ] expansion , according to [ORG Bechtel  ] Vice-President of Finance [PER Paul Gibbs  ] , on October 31 . 
See reftel for information on the delays , issues of risk , and consortia . 
[ORG ACS  ] senior representatives did not attend the latest [MISC ACP-Consortia  ] meeting ; a meeting [ORG ACP  ] Director of Engineering [PER Quijano  ] described as important to signaling the intentions of the consortia . 
[ORG Bechtel  ] signaled its reluctance to pour more resources into the project by closing its [ORG Panama Office  ] and reassigning personnel to other countries . 
While [ORG Bechtel  ] remains intent on bidding on the locks contract it will not continue to prepare detailed modifications to its bid specifications in reaction to changing [ORG ACP  ] requirements . 
Amendment 18 alone had 30 attachments and great uncertainty exists concerning the content of upcoming ( and " final " according to the [ORG ACP  ] ) 19th [ORG Amendment.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) While [PER Gibbs  ] recognizes that the extension provides the opportunity for the [ORG ACP  ] to iron out risk problems , that task has not been fully completed . 
[ORG Bechtel  ] is not fully certain of the outcome of the hydraulic risk as well as the selection of a cement price index. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Based upon conversations with representatives of [ORG Bechtel  ] , [ORG ACS  ] , and [ORG Project Management Advisor CH2MHill  ] , these organizations believe that only [ORG Bechtel  ] and [ORG ACS  ] are credible bidders , because the [MISC Spanish  ] consortium led by [PER Sacyr  ] is reportedly close to bankruptcy and half of the members of the [MISC French  ] consortium led by [ORG Bouygues  ] are not actively working towards submitting a bid . 
[PER Gibbs  ] stated that the deadline extension and uncertainty regarding risk favor [PER Sacyr  ] and [ORG Bouygues  ] , because these " weaker consortia " are more willing to submit a lowball bid and accept greater risk on the assumption they will be able to renegotiate key issues after the contract is awarded. ------------------------------------------ Potential Equipment Shortage due to Delays ------------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) According to a [ORG Caterpillar  ] 's Regional Manager for [LOC Latin America  ] [PER E. Hopkinson  ] on October 31 , the repeated extensions in the bid deadline already caused suppliers to evaluate maintaining equipment production slots for equipment for the winning consortium . 
[ORG Caterpillar  ] , who is pursuing equipment sales to the winning consortia , already reserved production slots for equipment to be used in the expansion . 
However , due to " lost patience " with the extensions , [ORG Caterpillar  ] may instead use those production slots for large mining companies which are long term customers that also use service contracts . 
The prestige and resulting increased business of working on the [LOC Panama  ] [ORG Canal  ] may not outweigh greater business opportunities elsewhere . 
According to [PER Hopkinson  ] , some large excavation equipment is not currently available due to a worldwide shortage of equipment and parts caused by a mining industry that remains healthy despite global financial crisis. ------------------------------- Control Over [ORG Project Management  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The attempt by [ORG CH2MHill  ] , the project management advisor for the entire [ORG Canal  ] expansion , to take greater control over the bidding process is still in flux - see reftel . 
[ORG CH2MHill  ] 's Construction Manager , [PER Joe Cazares  ] , is now the acting senior engineer-in-charge for the design and construction of the locks for the [ORG ACP  ] . 
[ORG CH2MHill  ] and the consortia positively view this change ; the preference is for [ORG CH2MHill  ] to take control over the bidding process and to produce a biddable document of interest to credible bidders. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The turbulence in the [LOC Panama  ] [ORG Canal  ] expansion bidding is only discussed in tight circles and is not present in the public domain . 
The messaging and press discipline of the [MISC Panamanians  ] on the biggest economic story in [LOC Panama  ] is stunning .
