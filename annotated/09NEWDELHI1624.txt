( C ) Summary: In a candid conversation with the Ambassador during the July 20 lunch hosted by Prime Minister [PER Singh  ] for the Secretary , [ORG Indian Congress Party  ] General Secretary [PER Rahul Gandhi  ] described his focus on upcoming state and local elections , expressed concerns regarding the challenges surrounding the [ORG UPA  ] coalition’s ability to implement its programs , and speculated about radicalization among [MISC Hindus  ] and [MISC Muslims  ] . 
[PER Gandhi  ] was interested in engaging with the Ambassador and could become a key interlocutor , along with other young members of Parliament , as we pursue a [ORG Strategic Dialogue  ] with [LOC India  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) During the Secretary’s July 20 meetings in New [LOC Delhi  ] ( see reftel ) , Prime Minister [PER Singh  ] hosted a lunch in honor of the Secretary . 
Among the invitees was [ORG Indian Congress Party  ] General Secretary [PER Rahul Gandhi  ] , as well as other prominent figures from politics , business and civil society . 
[PER Gandhi  ] , who was seated next to the Ambassador , shared his views on a range of political topics , social challenges , and electoral issues for the [ORG Congress Party  ] in the next five years . 
[ORG Rural Strategy  ] ---- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Gandhi  ] stressed that his focus in the upcoming months would be on state assembly elections in [LOC Maharashtra  ] and party building efforts at the local level . 
He was busy trying to recruit more appealing candidates to run for Member of [ORG Legislative Assembly  ] ( [ORG MLA  ] ) positions nationwide . 
Gandhi’s focus was on finding younger party members who would not carry some of the baggage of older [ORG Congress  ] candidates . 
He aimed at rebuilding party structures in small towns and rural areas to attract voters and believed the main opposition [ORG Bharatiya Janata Party  ] ( [ORG BJP  ] ) was vulnerable there . 
He did not seem to be as focused on electoral efforts in bigger cities , such as [LOC Delhi  ] and [LOC Mumbai  ] . 
Honeymoon is Over ---- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Noting that the [ORG Congress Party  ] victory in this past spring’s parliamentary elections had put the [ORG United Progressive Alliance  ] ( [ORG UPA  ] ) government in a comfortable position , [PER Gandhi  ] still expressed concerns about the numerous challenges regarding the UPA’s ability to implement its programs in Parliament . 
He said that the honeymoon period had been short and he now expected the [ORG BJP  ] and [ORG Left Parties  ] would be unrelenting critics of the government’s program . 
Speaking while the budget session of Parliament was ongoing , [PER Gandhi  ] touched on the difficulties in keeping the [ORG UPA  ] coalition on the right track . 
( Note: This conversation took place before the full scope of opposition to the July 16 [MISC Indo-Pakistani  ] joint statement in [LOC Sharm el Sheikh  ] had become apparent . 
End Note . 
) Creeping Radicalization ? ---- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Responding to the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] query about [MISC Lashkar-e-Taiba’s  ] activities in the region and immediate threat to [LOC India  ] , [PER Gandhi  ] said there was evidence of some support for the group among certain elements in India’s indigenous [MISC Muslim  ] community . 
However , [PER Gandhi  ] warned , the bigger threat may be the growth of radicalized [MISC Hindu  ] groups , which create religious tensions and political confrontations with the [MISC Muslim  ] community . 
( [PER Comment: Gandhi  ] was referring to the tensions created by some of the more polarizing figures in the [ORG BJP  ] such as Gujarat Chief Minister [PER Narendra Modi  ] . 
) The risk of a “home-grown” extremist front , reacting to terror attacks coming from [LOC Pakistan  ] or from [MISC Islamist  ] groups in [LOC India  ] , was a growing concern and one that demanded constant attention . 
Comment ---- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Gandhi  ] was forthright in describing the challenges faced by the [ORG Congress Party  ] and the [ORG UPA  ] government in the months ahead . 
Over the past four years , he was an elusive contact , but he could be interested in reaching out to the [LOC United States  ] , given a thoughtful , politically sensitive and strategic approach on our part . 
We will seek other opportunities to engage with him and with other promising NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00001624 002 OF 002 young members of the new generation of parliamentarians . 
[PER Gandhi  ] mentioned that in the recent election 60 members of the new Parliament were 45 or younger . 
In a system long viewed as relatively static , the influx of new faces and the rising profile of young leaders like [PER Rahul Gandhi  ] provides us an opening to expand the constituency in support of the strategic partnership with a long term horizon .
