Following a two-week workshop lead by [ORG U.S. Forest Service  ] ( [ORG USFS  ] ) experts , the [ORG Brazilian Center  ] for [ORG Forest Fire Fighting and Prevention  ] ( [ORG PREVFOGO/IBAMA  ] ) agreed to take the lead in forming a [ORG National Wildfire Coordination Group  ] , which will be responsible for elaborating and implementing a [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Incident Command System  ] . 
Improvement of resource efficiency and constructive inter-agency engagement in forest fire fighting and prevention are critical needs for [LOC Brazil  ] , a country where forest fires currently account for 75% of its greenhouse gas emissions . 
[ORG USFS  ] continued collaboration and assistance with institutional strengthening will be critical to moving these plans forward . 
END SUMMARY --------------------------------------- HISTORY OF [ORG USFS  ] COLLABORATION IN [LOC BRAZIL  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
Since 1991 , the [ORG U.S. Forest Service  ] ( [ORG USFS  ] ) and the [MISC Brazilian  ] Government have had an excellent collaborative program focused on exchanging experiences with fire management , sustainable forest management , forest administration and the conservation of biodiversity . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Natural Resources Agency  ] ( [ORG IBAMA  ] ) has been a primary [ORG USFS  ] partner since an implementing arrangement ( [ORG MOU  ] ) was first signed in 1992 . 
The collaboration has produced beneficial results for both countries and established long-lasting professional and personal relationships between [MISC Brazilian  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] natural resource managers and scientists. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
In the spring of 2007 , the [ORG Brazilian Center  ] for [ORG Forest Fire Fighting and Prevention  ] ( [ORG PREVFOGO/IBAMA  ] ) requested assistance from the [ORG USFS  ] to facilitate [MISC Brazilian  ] formation of a program similar to the [ORG U.S. National Wildfire Coordinating Group  ] ( [ORG NWCG  ] ) . 
This group would provide the umbrella coordination for all agencies involved in forest fire management in [LOC Brazil  ] , in order to maximize resource efficiency and build constructive inter-agency engagement . 
NOTE: [ORG PREVFOGO  ] is responsible for protecting the country 's natural protected areas from fire ; when a fire takes place in an [LOC Indigenous Reserve  ] , for example , the agency responsible ( [ORG FUNAI  ] ) does not have a coordinated incident response plan with any other agency but instead relies on help from [ORG PREVFOGO  ] . 
This lack of a structured response has seriously affected the efficiency of fire fighting and has led to unnecessary human and ecological losses . 
END NOTE. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
The threat of increased forest fires due to land use change and global climate change , predicted to decrease rainfall patterns and increase temperatures , is a serious concern for [LOC Brazil  ] , which is currently ranked as the fourth highest greenhouse gases emitting nation ( 75% due to fires ) . 
NOTE: Despite the [ORG GOB  ] having recognized the importance of forest fire fighting and prevention , the recently launched [ORG National Climate Change Plan  ] focuses on reducing deforestation without explicit reference to fighting fires . 
As was debated throughout the workshop , deforestation is a more interesting theme for media attention . 
END NOTE. --------------------------------------------- - DEVELOPING A [MISC BRAZILIAN  ] INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
Between September 29 and October 10 , three [ORG USFS  ] experts ( [PER Jacque Buchanan  ] - Forest Supervisor of the [ORG Lincoln National Forest  ] in [LOC New Mexico  ] ; [PER Paul Schmidtke  ] - Chief for [ORG Cooperative Fire Programs  ] for the [ORG US Forest Service  ] in [LOC Washington DC  ] ; and [PER Hugh Safford  ] - senior vegetation ecologist for the [ORG Forest Service  ] 's [LOC Pacific Southwest Region  ] ) traveled to [LOC Brazil  ] to discuss strategies for wildfire prevention and inter-agency fire coordination in a workshop setting , with the following specific objectives: 1 ) analyze the infrastructure and organization of [MISC Brazilian  ] agencies involved in forest fire fighting ; 2 ) provide information on the organization and operation of the [ORG USFS  ] forest fire management program ; and 3 ) assist [MISC Brazilian  ] partners in developing measures to improve the organization , standardization , and efficiency of the [MISC Brazilian  ] forest fire fighting and prevention system . 
The [ORG Regional Environmental HUB Office  ] assisted with workshop organization and implementation ; USAID/Brazil financially supported the workshop. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
The workshop brought together representatives from different [MISC Brazilian  ] governmental and non-governmental institutions to debate the appropriate structure for forest fire fighting and prevention in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The targeted outcomes of the workshop were twofold: --To develop a standardized , integrated , interagency three-tier system for forest fire fighting and prevention in [LOC Brazil  ] , at [LOC Federal  ] , State , and Local levels ; and --To develop a standardized forest fire incident response system. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
An [ORG Incident Command System  ] ( [ORG ICS  ] ) is a standardized , on-scene , all-hazard incident management concept used in the [LOC United States  ] , as well as in other countries worldwide . 
[ORG ICS  ] creates a flexible , scalable response organization providing a common framework within which people can work together effectively , providing standardized operating procedures and responses , with reduced potential for miscommunication . 
[ORG ICS  ] staff may be drawn from multiple agencies that do not routinely work together. ---------- NEXT STEPS: PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE ----------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
At the conclusion of the two-week workshop , a path forward was established that will lead the way toward improved [MISC Brazilian  ] inter-agency coordination . 
As part of the time-line drafted , [ORG PREVFOGO  ] agreed to define participants for the three-tiered , inter-agency coordination group by December 2008 . 
In May 2009 , [ORG PREVFOGO  ] is planning to arrange for signature of an [ORG Interagency Agreement  ] officially creating a [ORG National Wildfire Coordination Group  ] . 
The [ORG Coordination Group  ] is expected to create and/or strengthen State and Local coordination groups by May 2010 . 
NOTE: Nearly every [MISC Brazilian  ] state has a coordination group established , but only [LOC Minas Gerais  ] state seems to be advanced enough to coordinate a forest fire response efficiently . 
END NOTE. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
According to the time-line , the [ORG Brazilian National Coordination Group  ] will set standards for a [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Incident Command System  ] ( [ORG BICS  ] ) by December 2009 . 
In May 2010 the roles within this [ORG BICS  ] will be well-defined and standardized nationwide ; a data bank of personnel qualified to carry out each role will be created and accessed nationwide . 
10 . 
In addition , by May 2010 , a standardized incident reporting system will be established using a Web platform that will enable posting of information on fire and shared data. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
COMMENT: [ORG USFS  ] 's continued active support of these efforts would increase the prospects for [LOC Brazil  ] to meet the ambitious deadlines the [ORG GOB  ] has set for itself . 
Post believes that it would be valuable to have technical experts from the [ORG USFS  ] return for the [ORG First Meeting of the Brazilian National Wildfire Coordination Group  ] in May 2009 in order to identify what type of assistance and institutional strengthening will be needed to create the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Incident Command System  ] .
