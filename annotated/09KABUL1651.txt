( C ) SUMMARY: Assistant Ambassador [PER Mussomeli  ] discussed a range of issues with Minister of Interior ( [MISC MoI  ] ) [PER Hanif Atmar  ] on June 23 . 
On the [ORG Kunduz Regional Training Center  ] ( [ORG RTC  ] ) [ORG DynCorp  ] event of April 11 ( reftel ) , [PER Atmar  ] reiterated his insistence that the [LOC U.S.  ] try to quash any news article on the incident or circulation of a video connected with it . 
He continued to predict that publicity would “endanger lives.” He disclosed that he has arrested two [MISC Afghan  ] police and nine other [MISC Afghans  ] as part of an [MISC MoI  ] investigation into [MISC Afghans  ] who facilitated this crime of “purchasing a service from a child.” He pressed for [MISC CSTC-A  ] to be given full control over the police training program , including contractors . 
[PER Mussomeli  ] counseled that an overreaction by the [MISC Afghan  ] goverment ( [ORG GIRoA  ] ) would only increase chances for the greater publicity the [MISC MoI  ] is trying to forestall. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On armored vehicles and air transport for presidential candidates , [PER Atmar  ] pitched strongly to have the [ORG GIRoA  ] decide which candidates were under threat and to retain control of allocation of these assets . 
He agreed with the principle of a level playing field for candidates but argued that “direct support by foreigners” demonstrated a lack of confidence in [ORG GIRoA  ] . 
If [ORG GIRoA  ] failed to be fair , international assets and plans in reserve could be used . 
On another elections-related issue , [PER Atmar  ] claimed that two [LOC Helmand  ] would-be provincial candidates ( and key [PER Karzai  ] supporters ) disqualified under DIAG rules had actually possessed weapons as part of a [ORG GIRoA  ] contract to provide security for contractors. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Atmar  ] also was enthusiastic about working out arrangements with the 2nd [ORG Marine Expeditionary Brigade  ] ( [ORG MEB  ] ) in [LOC RC-South  ] to partner with the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Border Police  ] ( [ORG ABP  ] ) on training and joint operations to extend [ORG GIRoA  ] governance south . 
He is considering giving [PER BG Melham  ] , a highly regarded [MISC Afghan  ] officer , responsibility for [ORG ABP  ] in [LOC Nimruz  ] and [LOC Helmand  ] provinces . 
END SUMMARY . 
[ORG KUNDUZ RTC DYNCORP UPDATE  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) On June 23 , Assistant Ambassador [PER Mussomeli  ] met with MOI Minister [PER Hanif Atmar  ] on a number of issues , beginning with the April 11 [ORG Kunduz RTC DynCorp  ] investigation . 
[PER Amb Mussomeli  ] opened that the incident deeply upset us and we took strong steps in response . 
An investigation is on-going , disciplinary actions were taken against [ORG DynCorp  ] leaders in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , we are also aware of proposals for new procedures , such as stationing a military officer at [LOC RTCs  ] , that have been introduced for consideration . 
( [MISC Note: Placing  ] military officers to oversee contractor operations at [LOC RTCs  ] is not legally possible under the currentDynCorp contract . 
) Beyond remedial actions taken , we still hope the matter will not be blown out of proportion , an outcome which would not be good for either the [LOC U.S.  ] or [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
A widely-anticipated newspaper article on the [LOC Kunduz  ] scandal has not appeared but , if there is too much noise that may prompt the journalist to publish. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Atmar  ] said he insisted the journalist be told that publication would endanger lives . 
His request was that the [LOC U.S.  ] quash the article and release of the video . 
[PER Amb Mussomeli  ] responded that going to the journalist would give her the sense that there is a more terrible story to report . 
[PER Atmar  ] then disclosed the arrest of two [ORG Afghan National Police  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) and nine other [MISC Afghans  ] ( including [ORG RTC  ] language assistants ) as part of an [MISC MoI  ] investigation into [MISC Afghan  ] “facilitators” of the event . 
The crime he was pursuing was “purchasing a service from a child , ” which in [LOC Afghanistan  ] is illegal under both [ORG Sharia  ] law and the civil code , and against the [ORG ANP Code of Conduct  ] for police officers who might be involved . 
He said he would use the civil code and that , in this case , the institution of the [ORG ANP  ] will be protected , but he worried about the image of foreign mentors . 
[PER Atmar  ] said that President [PER Karzai  ] had told him that his ( Atmar’s ) “prestige” was in play in management of the [ORG Kunduz DynCorp  ] matter and another recent event in which Blackwater contractors mistakenly killed several [MISC Afghan  ] citizens . 
The President had asked him “Where is the justice ? ” <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Atmar  ] said there was a larger issue to consider . 
He [LOC KABUL  ] 00001651 002 OF 003 understood that within [ORG DynCorp  ] there were many “wonderful” people working hard , and he was keen to see proper action taken to protect them ; but , these contractor companies do not have many friends . 
He was aware that many questions about them go to SRAP [PER Holbrooke  ] and , in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , there is increasing public skepticism about contractors . 
On the other hand , the conduct of the [ORG Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan  ] ( [MISC CSTC-A  ] ) is disciplined . 
Looking at these facts , he said , he wanted [MISC CSTC-A  ] in charge . 
He wanted the [ORG ANP  ] to become a model security institution just like the [ORG Afghan National Army  ] ( [ORG ANA  ] ) and [ORG National Directorate for Security  ] ( [ORG NDS  ] ) , and the contractors were not producing what was desired . 
He suggested that the [LOC U.S.  ] establish and independent commission to review the mentor situation , an idea he said Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] had first raised . 
[PER Atmar  ] added that he also wanted tighter control over [MISC Afghan  ] employees . 
He was convinced that the [LOC Kunduz  ] incident , and other events where mentors had obtained drugs , could not have happened without [MISC Afghan  ] participation . 
ARMORED VEHICLES ( AND AIR TRANSPORT ) FOR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Atmar  ] expressed strong opinions about the use of armored vehicles for travel by presidential candidates that he has requested be provided to [MISC MoI  ] by the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] . 
He said it was up to [MISC MoI  ] to decide whether a candidate was under threat or not . 
[PER Atmar  ] opined that it should be an [ORG MoD  ] responsibility to provide air transport for presidential candidates . 
[PER Amb Mussomeli  ] explained that we want a level playing field , which [PER Atmar  ] agreed was necessary . 
However , [PER Atmar  ] said there were two important considerations: 1 ) some of the electorate will view that the candidates are controlled by foreigners if provided non-GIRoA transport ; and 2 ) bypassing the [MISC MoI  ] or [ORG MoD  ] with “direct support by foreigners” demonstrated a lack of confidence in the [LOC Afghanistan  ] government . 
When [PER Amb Mussomeli  ] said [ORG MOD  ] lacked adequate aircraft to cover all candidates , [PER Atmar  ] responded that [ORG MoD  ] could ask ISAF for help but should retain control of the travel . 
[PER Amb Mussomeli  ] pointed out that some reasonably worried that such a plan will falter or will not be fairly implemented . 
[PER Atmar  ] answered “Just give us a chance . 
If we fail , then you have your own planes and plans in reserve.” DIAG-DISQUALIFIED CANDIDATES IN [LOC HELMAND  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) In a discussion on two would-be provincial election candidates in [LOC Helmand  ] who were disqualified by the Disbandment of [ORG Illegally Armed Groups  ] ( DIAG ) program , [PER Atmar  ] said he had looked into requests to stand firm against their reinstatement , but it was a “big , contentious issue that is not explainable to President [PER Karzai.” Atmar  ] said that the only reason these two candidates were barred was for having weapons , apparently against DIAG rules . 
In fact , he said , they were “contracted by the state” to have those weapons in order to provide security for contractors . 
He acknowledged that the “contract” had not been properly registered , and suggested that the [ORG GIRoA  ] would take care of the registration . 
[MISC AFGHAN  ] BORDER POLICE ( [ORG ABP  ] ) AND PARTNERING WITH THE MARINES IN [LOC RC-SOUTH  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Atmar  ] enthusiastically proposed an [MISC MOI  ] meeting with the leadership of the 2nd [ORG Marine Expeditionary Brigade  ] ( [ORG MEB  ] ) and [MISC CSTC-A  ] to work out arrangements for good partnering , training , and joint operations with [MISC Afghan  ] security forces in [MISC RC-South  ] . 
The [ORG MEB  ] would like two [ORG ABP  ] companies ( approximately 250 police ) currently located near [LOC Lashkar Gah  ] to move south , and to be mobile enough to move further south when opportunities arise . 
The [ORG MEB  ] would like a customs officer to be attached to these [ORG ABP  ] companies so that the reach of [ORG GIRoA  ] governance can be extended when insurgent-controlled or dominated territory is opened . 
[PER Atmar  ] stopped short of making a final promise to give a highly-regarded [MISC Afghan  ] officer , [PER BG Melham  ] ( whom he personally respects ) , responsibility for the [ORG ABP  ] in [LOC Nimruz  ] and [LOC Helmand  ] provinces , but he was aware of concerns about the current responsible officer ( [PER BG Noorzai  ] ) . 
[LOC KABUL  ] INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL ( [ORG ISK  ] ) <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) [PER Amb Mussomeli  ] expressed concern over a plan by a [ORG District Police  ] Chief to remove security barriers at [ORG ISK  ] ( an primary and secondary school partially dependent on [ORG USAID  ] and other [MISC Mission  ] funding support ) that keep the road closed to [LOC KABUL  ] 00001651 003 OF 003 normal traffic . 
Removing the barriers could endanger the kids and teachers who walk between two compounds . 
[PER Atmar  ] said that he was very familiar with [ORG ISK  ] and “no barriers would be touched , ” although he added that perhaps an arrangement could be made to unblock the road and have the [ORG ISK  ] security personnel search vehicles .
