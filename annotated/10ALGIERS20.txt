Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S/NF ) [ORG MFA Americas  ] Director General [PER Sabri Boukadoum  ] expressed to the Ambassador January 6 the [MISC GOA’s  ] “profound dismay” regarding [ORG Algeria’s  ] inclusion on the [ORG TSA  ] list for enhanced screening . 
He said this message came directly from President [PER Bouteflika  ] . 
The [ORG TSA  ] decision , [PER Boukadoum  ] stressed , did not accurately reflect the level and quality of our bilateral relations , especially in regard to counterterrorism cooperation . 
[ORG Algeria’s  ] placement on the list had created the impression that [LOC Algeria  ] was part of the problem , a misunderstanding that is now circulating in the international press . 
[PER Boukadoum  ] told the Ambassador that [ORG Algeria’s  ] leadership would like an official [LOC U.S.  ] statement to correct this impression . 
Ambassador replied that the intent of the new measures was to ensure air travel safety and not to discriminate or embarrass our friends and partners . 
Ambassador emphasized that the [LOC U.S.  ] valued its counterterrorism cooperation with [LOC Algeria  ] and hoped the bilateral relationship would continue to grow and develop . 
END SUMMARY . 
GOA Not Pleased , Seeks Removal from List ---------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG MFA Americas  ] Director General [PER Sabri Boukadoum  ] called the Ambassador to the [ORG MFA  ] on January 6 to deliver instructions expressing the “profound dismay” of [ORG Algeria’s  ] highest authorities at [ORG Algeria’s  ] inclusion in the [ORG TSA  ] list of countries subject to new air passenger screening measures . 
[ORG MFA  ] Director for the Protection of [MISC Algerian  ] [ORG Citizens Overseas Hocine Sahraoui  ] , a representative of the presidency , [PER Houria Khiari  ] , and [LOC U.S.  ] desk officer [PER Abdulmutalib Bouacha  ] also attended . 
[PER Boukadoum  ] stressed several times at the outset of the meeting that his demarche instructions came directly from the “highest authority” -- i.e. , President [PER Bouteflika.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Boukadoum  ] told the Ambassador that he had been asked to convey two main points . 
The first concerned [ORG Algeria’s  ] inclusion on the [ORG TSA  ] list . 
[LOC Algeria  ] respected and understood the [LOC U.S.  ] need to secure the safety of its citizens and interests . 
But [ORG Algeria’s  ] inclusion on this list did not accurately reflect either the level or the quality of our bilateral relations , and especially the nature of those relations with regard to the fight against terrorism . 
The placement of [LOC Algeria  ] on a list that includes state sponsors of terrorism and countries of interest creates the impression that [LOC Algeria  ] is part of the problem and less than a full partner in the fight against terrorism . 
GOA Seeks [LOC U.S.  ] Statement on [LOC Algeria  ] as [ORG Key CT Partner  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The second point , he said , besides the [MISC GOA’s  ] desire to be removed from the list , was that the country’s leadership hoped to see an official [LOC U.S.  ] statement that would underscore [ORG Algeria’s  ] important counterterrorism partnership with the [LOC U.S.  ] -- in order to help correct the erroneous image of [LOC Algeria  ] that had been created by coverage of the [ORG TSA  ] story in the international media and on the [MISC Internet.  ] “We are partners , ” he said. “The highest levels did not appreciate this.” <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Boukadoum  ] said [ORG Algeria’s  ] Ambassador to the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Abdullah Baali  ] would deliver the same message in [LOC Washington  ] . 
[PER Baali  ] also had instructions to see Secretary of [ORG Homeland Security Napolitano  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] Focus is on [ORG Air Travel Safety  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The Ambassador said GOA views would be reported fully and immediately to [LOC Washington  ] . 
He told [PER Boukadoum  ] that President [PER Obama  ] had addressed the issue squarely in a statement the previous day . 
The problem was that on [MISC Christmas Day  ] a terrorist had gotten through . 
This had been a systemic failure , and as a result the President had ordered two reviews -- one of our watch list system , and another of aviation screening procedures . 
The intent of the new measures was not to discriminate against or embarrass any persons , groups , or countries , and most especially not our friends and partners . 
The intent was to do the necessary to ensure air travel safety , for everyone . 
President [PER Obama  ] had thus made clear on January 5 that he had personally ordered , and approved , the new measures . 
And he had promised that more steps could be on the way in coming days , whether with regard to information integration or passenger screening . 
[ORG U.S. Values Counterterrorism Cooperation with Algeria  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) At the same time , the Ambassador continued , the President also had made clear that an important part of our approach would be to deepen cooperation with our international partners . 
This was where [LOC Algeria  ] , and [MISC US-Algerian  ] cooperation , came in . 
The Ambassador noted that we have worked together to improve both the quality and level of our bilateral exchanges in recent years , and he hoped that trend would continue . 
It was unnecessary to say how much the [LOC United States  ] valued its counterterrorism cooperation with [LOC Algeria  ] , as well as our overall relationship with [LOC Algeria  ] . 
We hoped to continue to develop and build on the progress that has been made. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Boukadoum  ] reiterated that [ORG Algeria’s  ] disagreement was not with the measures themselves . 
Rather [LOC Algeria  ] protested its inclusion on TSA’s list because it gives the impression that [LOC Algeria  ] is not cooperating. “We are cooperating on counterterrorism , and we will continue to do so , ” he stated . 
Meanwhile , [PER Boukadoum  ] asserted that other countries with nationals who have committed terrorist acts have not been placed on the list . 
[PER Boukadoum  ] argued that to suggest that [LOC Algeria  ] is part of the problem is simply unfair . 
He regretted that international press coverage of the [ORG TSA  ] screening measures had cast [LOC Algeria  ] in this light and not as country that is a victim of terrorism . 
Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S/NF ) A key line in this demarche was the point that [ORG Algeria’s  ] inclusion on the [ORG TSA  ] list “does not reflect the level and quality of our relations , or the nature of our relations in the fight against terrorism” . 
With this , the GOA implicitly brought the quality of the entire relationship into play . 
What grates is that , instead of being seen as a nation that has suffered from terrorism and as an active leader in combating it , they feel instead cast as part of the problem and associated with state sponsors . 
This sense of damage to [ORG Algeria’s  ] international reputation , and especially by the way the story has pinged around in the press and on the [MISC Internet  ] , is what undoubtedly fueled President [PER Bouteflika’s  ] “profound dismay” . 
That said , it is encouraging that [LOC Algeria  ] carefully separated the meeting yesterday -- to inform us of their approval of [MISC EP-3  ] overflights by [ORG Africa Command  ] against [ORG AQIM  ] in the [LOC Sahel  ] -- and the meeting today on the [ORG TSA  ] issue . 
This suggests they are trying to separate issues and limit damage . 
But domestic and regional public opinion does count , so the leadership will want to redress somehow what they perceive as a blow to their national dignity and international prestige . 
Hence the request that a senior [LOC U.S.  ] official make a statement that will help turn around the negative image in the international media. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S/NF ) It is worth remembering that no country is more important than [LOC Algeria  ] in the fight against [ORG al-Qa’ida  ] in the [LOC Sahel  ] and [LOC Maghreb  ] . 
So it is probably worth looking for a good chance to make that point publicly , and at as high a level as possible . 
If we do not , it is doubtful that we would see any dramatic gestures or sudden moves by [LOC Algeria  ] . 
On the contrary , counterterrorism cooperation would probably continue , to the extent it is in the interest of both sides . 
It would more likely be a matter of what we don’t see - mil-mil relations frozen instead of advancing , efforts to expand law enforcement cooperation slowed , large commercial contracts going to non-U.S. bidders , reduced Embassy access to senior officials , and generally less receptivity to coordination on regional issues and in multilateral fora .
