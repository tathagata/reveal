This first group will be assigned to [ORG Regional Embassy Offices  ] ( [ORG REOs  ] ) and the [ORG Regional  ] and Provincial Reconstruction Teams where [ORG DS  ] has [ORG PSD  ] responsibilities .

( C ) STATUS: NO CHANGE . 
[ORG RSO  ] has engaged [ORG MNF-I  ] on this issue and reviewed the operational security ( [ORG OPSEC  ] ) concerns with respect to readable vehicle number signage . 
It is the collective assessment of the [ORG Embassy  ] and [ORG MNF-I  ] that a vehicle numbering system is only viable if all [MISC USG PSDs  ] adopt the same numbering scheme and non-USG PSDs also agree to voluntarily adopt the same system . 
[ORG MNF-I  ] is not inclined to support a numbering system solely for [ORG US Embassy Baghdad PSCs  ] as it may offer enemy forces the ability to identify them as such and bring greater risk to [ORG COM  ] movements . 
Post recommends that this recommendation be reconsidered in light of the extensive communications and de-confliction measures that have been put into effect by [ORG RSO  ] , [ORG MNF-I  ] , and [ORG MNC-I  ] which are proving to be effective. --------------------------------------------- --------- [ORG Kennedy Recommendation  ] 11 - Investigations and [ORG RSO Response Unit  ] --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 .

The [ORG FIU  ] will be responsible for the investigation of all serious incidents involving DOS-affiliated PSCs to include Tier I and Tier II private security contractors . 
Position descriptions have been written and funding is being pursued .

All claimants accepted the payments . 
In addition , the [MISC Iraqi  ] who suffered an injury informed the [ORG DCM  ] that he had been punished for his absence at work when he was recovering from his injury . 
The [ORG DCM  ] apologized and offered to write a letter to his employer explaining the cause of his absence , which was provided to the claimant at a later date. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) On December 27 , 2007 , the Deputy Chief of [LOC Mission  ] , [ORG RSO  ] , and Acting [ORG Embassy  ] Legal Adviser made condolence payments to three [MISC Iraqis  ] who had been injured and the widow of an [MISC Iraqi  ] who had been killed in the incident . 
All claimants accepted the payments . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] is continuing to work to obtain contact information for all of the potential claimants from the September 16 incident and plans to make additional payments in the future as it locates those claimants . 
To date , the [ORG Embassy  ] has paid 132,500 dollars to claimants: 40,000 dollars to the families of 4 killed , 65,000 dollars to 13 injured , and 27,500 dollars to 11 claimants for vehicle damage. ------------------------------ [ORG Blackwater Condolence Payments  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) On January 18 , 2007 , the [ORG DCM  ] and [ORG RSO  ] met with [ORG Blackwater  ] representatives and were briefed on [ORG Blackwater  ] , s intentions to make condolence payments to the victims of the September 16 Nisur Square incident and to obtain an operating license from the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] . 
In a change from [ORG Blackwater  ] 's previous position , the representatives said that [ORG Blackwater  ] has hired a number of [MISC Iraqi  ] attorneys , including one who has had significant experience dealing with [ORG MNFI  ] on [MISC Iraqi  ] claims cases , to work with local courts on payment issues and plans to follow procedures for payments as determined by local laws and regulations . 
[ORG Blackwater  ] has set aside " a generous pot " of money for these payments and the [MISC Iraqi  ] attorneys will be contacting survivors and relatives of the deceased . 
Representatives said that they intended to make payments to all claimants , including those with lawsuits pending in the [LOC United States  ] , largely because they did not expect those lawsuits to be successful . 
They also said that they would take into account the specific requests and circumstances of the claimants where possible. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) [ORG Blackwater  ] is also moving ahead with efforts to obtain an operating license from the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] ( [ORG MOI  ] ) , and said that through their lawyers' communications with the [ORG MOI  ] they were told that Prime Minister [PER Maliki  ] would approve the licensing of [ORG Blackwater  ] if condolence payments are made . 
They have received this same assurance from members of the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] responsible for licensing. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) The [ORG DCM  ] told [ORG Blackwater  ] that the [ORG Embassy  ] believed it was morally correct for [ORG Blackwater  ] to make condolence payments . 
She also indicated that while the [ORG Embassy  ] welcomes this action by [ORG Blackwater  ] , it will not have any effect on the DOS/Embassy decision on whether to retain [ORG Blackwater  ] , and that in regards to the [ORG MOI  ] licensing issue , under no circumstances could the [ORG Embassy  ] approve of or in any way be part of a bribery effort . 
The [ORG Blackwater  ] representatives indicated that they understood and that the process would be straightforward and transparent. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) In follow-up communications with [ORG Blackwater  ] , [ORG RSO  ] provided a list of all known victims and their available contact information . 
As of January 31 , [ORG Blackwater  ] 's [MISC Iraqi  ] attorneys had been able to contact family members of 6 of the deceased victims , and 12 of the victims that had suffered injuries and/or property damage . 
They continue to reach out to the additional victims ( about 20 more ) and have enlisted the help of the [MISC Iraqi  ] Police to locate the victims for which there is no contact information ( [ORG Note: Blackwater  ] has agreed to provide the [ORG Embassy  ] with contact information for any victims they are able to locate but for which the [ORG Embassy  ] did not have contact information or were not able to locate . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] will make its own payments to any additional victims that it is able to locate in this manner . 
End Note . 
) [ORG Blackwater  ] said that on February 1 , 2008 , their [MISC Iraqi  ] attorneys would begin to meet with each of the victims to express their sympathy and to interview them to subsequently craft an individual condolence payment amount for each victim . 
On average , [ORG Blackwater  ] said it expects they will pay at least twice as much as what the [ORG Embassy  ] paid and substantially more for victims or families that were more significantly impacted by the incident . 
As an example , he cited a family that lost their bread winner , a man who was already supporting the families of four of his brothers whom had been killed as a result of sectarian violence. ----------------- CPA 17 Draft Law ---------------- <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) There has been no change in the status of the draft law to repeal CPA Order 17 . 
The [ORG Council of Ministers  ] approved a draft law and voted to send it to the [ORG Council of Representatives  ] , but to date the draft has not yet been transmitted to the [ORG CoR  ] . 
Once submitted , the law could pass in as little as one to two weeks given existing procedures . 
There has not , however , been much discussion on this draft law in recent weeks . 
We have engaged the [MISC GOI  ] in an effort to prevent the Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs from submitting the proposed legislation to the [ORG CoR  ] . 
In meetings with and in letters to [MISC GOI  ] officials , we have highlighted the steps that the [ORG Embassy  ] has taken to implement the [ORG Kennedy Report  ] recommendations , the [ORG Memorandum of Agreement  ] between the [ORG Department of State and Department of Defense  ] on [MISC USG PSDs  ] that was recently signed , and the ongoing [ORG FBI  ] investigation into the September 16 incident .
