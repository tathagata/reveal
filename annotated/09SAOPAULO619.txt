Brooks  ] , State , State , POL ; REASON: 1.4 ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: [LOC Sao Paulo  ] pundits and politicos are strongly split on [MISC Brazilbs  ] role in [LOC Honduras  ] . 
Mainstream academic experts in this generally pro-PSDB state criticized [MISC Brazilbs  ] shielding of [LOC Zelaya  ] as adventurist , counter-productive and contradictory of the countrybs traditional policy of non-intervention . 
[ORG Workers Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) contacts , in contrast , strongly defended the [PER Lula  ] governmentbs decision to shelter [LOC Zelaya  ] . 
They argue that permitting Zelayabs overthrow to go unchallenged would have a domino effect , putting at risk other left-oriented regimes in [LOC El Salvador  ] and [LOC Guatemala  ] and thereby endangering the [MISC PTbs  ] bsocial democraticb ( i.e. non-Chavez ) vision for [LOC Latin America  ] . 
Evidently , at least some in the [ORG PT  ] ranks now see democratically-elected , left-oriented Central [MISC American  ] regimes as junior allies to be protected . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) This cable resulted from a wide range of interviews with foreign policy experts and [ORG Workers Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) contacts , including: [ORG University of Sao Paulo  ] Professor [PER Jose Augusto Guilhon  ] de Abuquerque ; [PER Felipe DbAvila  ] and [PER Rogerio Schmitt  ] of the [ORG Center for Leadership Training ; Professors  ] [PER Marcus Freitas  ] and [PER Gunther Rudzit  ] of the [PER Armando Alvares Penteado Foundation  ] ( [ORG FAAP  ] ) ; General [PER Alberto Santos Cruz  ] of the [MISC Brazilian  ] Army ; [ORG PT  ] founder and [LOC Sao Paulo City Council  ] member [PER Jose Americo  ] ; and [ORG PT State Deputy  ] [PER Rui Falcao  ] . 
The [ORG Critics: Brazil is Dancing  ] to [PER Chavezb Tune  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) All the critics ( [PER Albuquerque  ] , [PER DbAvila  ] , [PER Schmitt  ] , [PER Freitas  ] , [PER Rudzit  ] and [PER Santos Cruz  ] ) thought that [PER Hugo Chavez  ] had set the agenda for [LOC Brazil  ] in [LOC Honduras  ] . 
Most believed that Zelayabs September 23 appearance at the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Tegucigalpa  ] had taken the GOB by surprise . 
Moreover , they viewed Zelayabs subsequent use of the [ORG Embassy  ] as a base of operation to provoke demonstrations in his favor as contradicting [MISC Brazilbs  ] longstanding policy of non-intervention . 
This also completely undercut the GOBbs credibility as a mediator , leaving [LOC Brazil  ] with less flexibility , they concluded . 
A [MISC Slide Into Greater Intervention  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Professor [PER Albuquerque  ] was more subtle than most critics , noting that President Lulabs predecessor , PSDB President [PER Fernando Henrique Cardoso  ] , also tried to influence his neighborsb politics . 
[LOC Brazil  ] , [PER Albuquerque  ] stated , blocked a coup against President [PER Wasmosy  ] of [LOC Paraguay  ] in 1996 and pressured President [PER Fujimori  ] to resign in [LOC Peru  ] in 2000 . 
These moves , though representing a departure from strict non-intervention , were low profile , supported bmid-term negotiated solutionsb and clearly had the object of preserving democracy as their goal . 
The [PER Lula  ] administration has changed this logic , becoming an open protagonist for [PER Zelaya  ] , a man whose democratic credentials are questionable . 
This may work well in the short term , [PER Albuquerque  ] said , but if the policy proves costly , [MISC Brazilian  ] public opinion could react against it . 
[LOC Brazil  ] , unlike the other BRICs , has suffered no threats to its borders and , consequently , there is no popular consensus to support costly foreign interventions . 
[ORG PT Reps Defend the Policy  ] as Principle , [PER Zelaya  ] as bFamilyb <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG PT  ] reps [PER Rui Falcao  ] and [PER Jose Americo  ] both stated flatly that , even though the GOB was likely bset upb by [PER Chavez  ] , a [ORG PT  ] government had to defend [PER Zelaya  ] as a matter of principle . 
As a party whose leaders had suffered under a former military regime , the [PER Lula  ] administration could not turn its back on [PER Zelaya  ] . 
Had it done so , the partybs base would have reacted strongly . 
[PER Americo  ] , in particular , acknowledged that Zelayabs own record had its blemishes , but he countered by saying that [PER Zelaya  ] was like ba bad son-in-law , b though he might cause trouble , he was still bfamilyb and the [ORG PT  ] was obliged to come to his aid . 
[LOC Honduras  ] is Not the Point <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Beyond family ties , [PER Falcao  ] and [PER Americo  ] both argued [LOC Honduras  ] as a possible tipping point for Central [LOC America  ] . 
The [ORG PT  ] has a bsocial democraticb ( i.e. non-Chavez ) vision for [LOC Latin America  ] , and Zelayabs successful overthrow could have undermined two other key elected Central [MISC American  ] leaders who fit into this: [PER Mauricio Funes  ] in [LOC El Salvador  ] and [PER Alvaro Colom  ] in [LOC Guatemala  ] . 
( [PER Note: Americo  ] noted several connections between [LOC El Salvadorbs  ] President [PER Funes  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] . 
He reminded [PER Poloff  ] that Funesb spouse is [MISC Brazilian  ] and a member of the [ORG PT  ] , said that [PER Funes  ] had visited [LOC Sao Paulo  ] in August , and described how [PER Funes  ] had recently promoted a certain Colonel [PER DbAvila  ] in the [MISC Salvadoran  ] Army , bumping him up over several other officers . 
This last , if correct , suggested a rather surprising level of detailed knowledge of [MISC Salvadoran  ] politics for a state-level [MISC Brazilian  ] politician . 
End Note . 
) Both [ORG PT  ] reps stated that [PER Funes  ] and [PER Colom  ] had won recent elections by narrow margins . 
If Zelayabs deposition had remained unopposed , the [MISC U.S.-trained  ] armies in their countries might have felt tempted to try something similar . 
The [ORG PT  ] reps saw this as possible even under President [PER Obama  ] because , in their view , the [ORG Pentagon  ] has its own agenda . 
[PER Americo  ] justified the vigorous defense of [LOC Zelaya  ] , saying that bdespite the good intentions of President [PER Obama  ] and Secretary [PER Clinton  ] , the [ORG Pentagon  ] apparatus can enforce its own agendab in the region , and so a vigorous defense of [LOC Zelaya  ] was required . 
[ORG Comment:  ] 7 . 
( C ) Foreign Policy does not rate highly on the list of most Braziliansb concerns . 
As such , the GOB can generally do what it wants in places like [LOC Honduras  ] , so long as there are no significant economic or human costs to the policy . 
[ORG PT  ] insiders notions of Central [MISC American  ] dominos could be significant . 
While some dose of anti-Pentagon paranoia figured in their statements , it is clear that at least for some in the [ORG PT  ] base , [LOC Brazil  ] should act as a patron for democratically elected left-oriented regimes in Central [LOC America  ] , a region that , heretofore , has lain outside [MISC Brazilbs  ] traditional sphere of influence .
