End Summary . 
2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) A visibly angry [PER Musa Kusa  ] summoned the Ambassador ( accompanied by P/E Chief ) on October 26 to express very strong [MISC Libyan  ] anger , including that of the [MISC Libyan  ] Leader , regarding the reported treatment [ORG UN Permanent  ] Representative [PER Abdulrahman Shalgam  ] had received recently during security processing at [PER John F. Kennedy Airport  ] in [LOC New York  ] . 
[PER Kusa  ] said [PER Shalgam  ] and his wife were put in a room and subjected to " strip searches and rude behavior as if they were criminals . 
" The trauma had affected [PER Shalgam  ] 's wife so deeply that , according to [PER Kusa  ] , she is currently under hospital care . 
3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Kusa  ] called the incident unjustified and immoral: " Morally speaking , [PER Shalgam  ] is a guest in your country . 
If he had done something wrong or was a security threat , then that would have been a different story . 
How would you like it if your diplomats were treated by us in such a manner ? 
" He argued that if a high level diplomat such as [PER Shalgam  ] -- a former foreign minister -- could experience such treatment by [LOC U.S.  ] officials , then other [MISC Libyan  ] diplomats or average [MISC Libyan  ] travelers were probably facing even worse treatment . 
[PER Kusa  ] stated that the [ORG GOL  ] was considering withdrawing [PER Shalgam  ] from his post as a result of the incident . 
4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The Ambassador informed [PER Kusa  ] that the Embassy first heard of the incident via [ORG MFA  ] diplomatic note four days prior to the meeting and was working with the [ORG Departments of State  ] and [ORG Homeland Security  ] to investigate the situation . 
[PER Kusa  ] believed the [ORG State Department  ] should have " known " about the incident immediately . 
He asserted that news of the incident had spread throughout the leadership and had resurrected intensive questioning as to how [LOC Libya  ] could justify this new relationship with the [LOC United States  ] , saying " if you do not desire to continue the relationship , then tell us . 
There is no need to treat [MISC Libyan  ] nationals in such a manner . 
" 5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The Ambassador told [PER Kusa  ] that [LOC Libya  ] should not interpret the reported actions of a few individuals as reflective of an official , anti-Libya position within the [ORG USG  ] . 
He added that both sides understand that , from time to time , problems will occur in the relationship , and that we should find a way to work through them . 
[PER Kusa  ] said the [MISC Libyan  ] Government -- including [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi himself -- wanted a full report from the [LOC U.S.  ] explaining why a senior [MISC Libyan  ] official had been subject to the alleged mistreatment . 
He was baffled by the circumstances that could have prompted such action . 
The Ambassador reiterated his assurances that the [ORG USG  ] would review the circumstances surrounding the incident . 
6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Kusa  ] stated that [LOC Libya  ] would not retaliate against [LOC U.S.  ] travelers in response to the incident . 
He insisted on a speedy reply to the [ORG GOL  ] 's request for a full investigation . 
" We will consider the case open until we reach an acceptable conclusion . 
In light of what happens , we will carry out appropriate measures , " he warned . 
[PER Kusa  ] threatened that [LOC Libya  ] might be forced to take the issue to the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] and that [PER Shalgam  ] may personally relate the events in that forum . 
7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Comment:  ] The incident involving [PER Abdulrahman Shalgam  ] , compounded by [MISC Libyan  ] reports of previous incidents involving its diplomats and officials , has elicited attention and anger at the highest levels of the [MISC Libyan  ] regime . 
Embassy requests expeditious Department assistance in investigating the TRIPOLI 00000868 002.2 OF 002 circumstances surrounding the incident . 
As recent [MISC Swiss  ] and [MISC Canadian  ] encounters have shown , [LOC Libya  ] takes these issues seriously and we need to provide a reply and find a solution quickly if the matter is not to escalate .
