<code><pre>Thursday , 17 December 2009 , 11:37 S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 02 [ORG KAMPALA  ] 001401 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 2019/12/17 TAGS PREL , [LOC EPET  ] , [LOC ECON  ] , [LOC EIND  ] , [LOC PGOV  ] , [LOC KCOR  ] , UG SUBJECT: UGANDA: TULLOW SEES CORRUPTION IN OIL SALE REF: [ORG KAMPALA  ] 1356 CLASSIFIED BY: [PER Donald Cordell  ] , Economic Officer , State ; REASON: 1.4 ( B ) , ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: [ORG Tullow Oil  ] claims senior [MISC Ugandan  ] government officials were “compensated” to support the sale of a partner/rival firm’s exploration and production rights to [MISC Italian  ] oil company [ORG ENI  ] ( ref . 
A ) . 
[ORG Tullow Vice  ] President for [LOC Africa  ] [PER Tim O’Hanlon  ] identified Security Minister and [ORG National Resistance Movement  ] ( [ORG NRM  ] ) Secretary General [PER Amama Mbabazi  ] and Energy and [ORG Mineral Development  ] Minister [PER Hilary Onek  ] as [MISC Ugandan  ] officials who benefited from the sale of production rights by [ORG Heritage Oil and Gas  ] to [ORG ENI  ] . 
He requested [LOC U.S.  ] assistance in ensuring the open and transparent sale of oil assets . 
If Tullow’s allegations are true - and we believe they are - then this is a critical moment for Uganda’s nascent oil sector . 
The [MISC Heritage-ENI  ] sale will likely derail any potential partnership between [ORG Tullow  ] and [ORG Exxon Mobil  ] and have profound consequences for transparency and openness in the future management of the industry . 
End Summary. --------------------- Seeking Partners --------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) On 14 December , [PER Tim O’Hanlon  ] , [ORG Tullow Oil’s Regional Vice  ] President for [LOC Africa  ] met with Ambassador [PER Lanier  ] to discuss recent developments in oil exploration in [LOC Uganda  ] ( see ref . 
A for background ) . 
[PER O’Hanlon  ] explained that the $10+ billion required to produce , refine , and export oil from [LOC Uganda  ] far exceeds the financial capacity of [LOC Tullow  ] and other mid-sized exploration companies currently working in [LOC Uganda  ] . 
[ORG Tullow  ] is therefore considering selling a portion of its [LOC Uganda  ] holdings to a larger international oil partner , and has unofficially “short listed” three major companies as potential partners - including [ORG Exxon Mobil  ] , Total ( [LOC France  ] ) , and the [ORG Chinese National Offshore Oil Company  ] ( [ORG CNOOC  ] ) . 
After [ORG Tullow  ] concludes its process of selecting a partner , likely in January or February 2010 , [ORG Tullow  ] will present the “bids” to the [LOC Uganda  ] government and work with [MISC Ugandan  ] officials to gain approval of the much larger oil partner. --------------------- An Oily Business --------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) In contrast , [PER O’Hanlon  ] said the recent effort by [ORG Heritage Oil and Gas  ] to sell its oil exploration and production license to [ORG ENI  ] was apparently a corrupt back door deal . 
[PER O’Hanlon  ] observed that since news of the [ORG ENI  ] sale broke , even Ministers unrelated to oil ( such as Minister of State for Fisheries [PER Fred Mukisa  ] ) have issued public statements supporting [ORG ENI  ] . 
[PER O’Hanlon  ] alleged that Security Minister [PER Mbabazi  ] and Energy Minister [PER Onek  ] received payments from [ORG Heritage  ] and/or [ORG ENI  ] in exchange for their support . 
[PER O’Hanlon  ] referred to Minister [PER Mbabazi  ] , who facilitated an August 2009 meeting between [ORG ENI  ] and [ORG Tullow  ] , as [ORG ENI’s  ] “patron” in [LOC Uganda  ] , and said [ORG ENI  ] created a shell company in [LOC London  ] - [ORG TKL Holdings  ] - through frontmen [PER Mark Christian  ] and [PER Moses Seruje  ] - to funnel money to [PER Mbabazi  ] . 
[PER O’Hanlon  ] also noted what he described as Onek’s recent unsolicited “grandstanding” before Parliament in support of [ORG ENI  ] , and similar statements of support during a recent [MISC Indo-African  ] energy conference in New [MISC Dehli  ] . 
[PER Onek  ] made impossible claims at the [MISC Indo-African  ] conference regarding [ORG ENI’s  ] ability to export 100,000 - 200,000 barrels per day within two years . 
Comment: These statements of support by [PER Onek  ] appear completely inappropriate given that the deal is still technically pending . 
End comment. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER O’Hanlon  ] said [ORG ENI’s Uganda  ] deal is part of a wider effort , facilitated by [ORG Heritage  ] , to gain control of all oil fields on both sides of [LOC Lake Albert  ] . 
In addition to its exploration blocks in [LOC Uganda  ] , [ORG Tullow  ] claims to have exploration rights on the [MISC Congolese  ] side of [LOC Lake Albert  ] . 
[PER O’Hanlon  ] said Tullow’s exploration efforts on the [MISC DRC  ] side of [LOC Lake Albert  ] are hampered by Tullow’s refusal to pay off key [MISC Congolese  ] officials , including President [PER Laurent Kabila  ] . 
[PER O’Hanlon  ] added that [ORG Heritage  ] recently offered to help [ORG Tullow  ] “take [ORG KAMPALA  ] 00001401 002 OF 002 care” of problems on the [MISC Congolese  ] side in order to begin exploration . 
[ORG Tullow  ] refused , according to [PER O’Hanlon.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER O’Hanlon  ] concluded by asking the [LOC U.S.  ] to help bring these corruption allegations to light and raise concerns - perhaps in concert with the [MISC British  ] High Commissioner or other development partners - over how the [MISC Heritage-ENI  ] sale has transpired . 
[PER O’Hanlon  ] confirmed that [ORG Tullow  ] has the contractual right to prevent the [MISC Heritage-ENI  ] sale by exercising its contractual “right of first refusal” as a 50% partner in both of [MISC Heritage’s  ] exploration blocks and will exercise that right . 
He said [ORG Tullow  ] is confident that one of the potential major oil partners ( preferably [ORG Exxon Mobil  ] ) will be able to assist [ORG Tullow  ] in financing the approximately $1.5 billion needed to foil the [ORG GOU  ] supported [ORG ENI  ] deal by purchasing [MISC Heritage’s Ugandan  ] holdings . 
An [ORG Exxon Mobil  ] executive confirmed to EconOff on December 16 that [ORG Exxon Mobil  ] has a strong interest in [LOC Uganda  ] but is still evaluating available data before making an offer . 
Because an eventual [MISC Tullow-Exxon  ] deal will require [MISC Ugandan  ] government approval , the [ORG GOU  ] could still prevent [ORG Tullow  ] from raising the funds needed in order to buy out [ORG Heritage  ] ( so it could then sell those shares to [ORG Exxon Mobil  ] ) and thereby deny [ORG Tullow  ] the means to effectively block [ORG ENI’s  ] entrance into the [MISC Ugandan  ] oil market. --------------------------------------------- --- Comment: Inaction Sets Bad Precedent --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) This is a critical moment for the future of Uganda’s oil industry . 
The [MISC Heritage-ENI  ] deal could prevent a multi-billion dollar deal for [ORG Exxon Mobil  ] by drastically diminishing both the size and value of Tullow’s [MISC Ugandan  ] holdings . 
Allegations that Minister [PER Mbabazi  ] , who has already been implicated in other government corruption scandals , solicited and/or accepted payment in exchange for government support will , if true , have serious adverse effects on the economic activity of [LOC U.S.  ] businesses in [LOC Uganda  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] Mission goals regarding accountability , good governance , and economic development . 
After discussions with [ORG Exxon Mobil  ] to confirm Tullow’s story , we intend to approach the [MISC British  ] High Commissioner and the [MISC Irish  ] Ambassador about drafting a joint letter to President [PER Museveni  ] expressing concern about these very troubling signs of high-level corruption in Uganda’s oil sector , and advocating for the open and transparent sale of oil assets and management of future oil revenues . 
Depending on the outcome of this major deal , we believe it could be time to consider tougher action - to include visa revocation - for senior officials like [PER Mbabazi  ] who are consistently linked to corruption scandals impacting the international activity of [LOC U.S.  ] businesses , [LOC U.S.  ] foreign assistance goals , and the stability of democratic institutions .
