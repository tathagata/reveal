( C ) SUMMARY: Cognizant of the threat posed to its nuclear industry by terrorists and determined to counter a spate of bad publicity from recent accidents at its nuclear facilities , the [ORG GOS  ] is taking steps to ensure the security of its nuclear facilities . 
This cable provides a backdrop of past terrorist attacks against [LOC Spain  ] 's nuclear facilities , highlights recent security and safety incidents at nuclear plants , and , as requested in REFTEL A , addresses how [LOC Spain  ] accounts for its nuclear material and how it is physically protecting its nuclear material and facilities . 
The [ORG IAEA  ] recently fulfilled a peer review , requested by the [ORG GOS  ] , of [LOC Spain  ] 's nuclear regulatory infrastructure and its safety practices in nuclear installations , radiation , waste , transport , emergency preparedness and -- for the [ORG IAEA  ] 's first time -- nuclear security . 
The [ORG IAEA  ] , s [ORG Integrated Regulatory Review Service  ] ( [ORG IRRS  ] ) conducted site inspections , interviews and evaluations in early 2008 and in November 2008 publicly issued its final report , the results of which the [ORG IRRS  ] team leader publicly described as " excellent " for [LOC Spain  ] . 
On January 14 , [PER POLOFF  ] met [PER Julio Barcelo  ] , Commissioner at [LOC Spain  ] 's Nuclear Security Council ( [ORG CSN  ] ) , to discuss the [ORG IRRS  ] report and broader issues of nuclear security in [LOC Spain  ] . 
[PER POLOFF  ] also discussed [MISC Spanish  ] nuclear security issues on January 26 with knowledgeable [ORG U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission  ] ( [ORG NRC  ] ) officials , the first of whom stated that the [ORG GOS  ] has made a concerted effort to enhance physical security requirements at its nuclear facilities since 9/11 and the [LOC Madrid  ] train bombings in 2004 . 
The second [ORG NRC  ] official stressed that there is a long-standing history of bilateral cooperation between the [ORG USG  ] and the [ORG GOS  ] on the physical protection of nuclear facilities . 
END SUMMARY. //Spain 's Nuclear Plants - A History of Previous Terrorist Attacks , The [ORG Threat of Future Attacks//  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [MISC Spanish  ] nuclear facilities - [LOC Spain  ] currently is home to eight civil-use nuclear reactors at six plants , as detailed in REFTEL B - are a past and present target of terrorism . 
During 1977-82 , the domestic terrorist group [ORG Basque Fatherland and Liberty  ] ( known as [ORG ETA  ] ) conducted a series of attacks on the nuclear plant that was under construction in [LOC Lemoniz  ] , in [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG Basque Region  ] . 
On separate occasions , [ORG ETA  ] exploded bombs near the reactor and the turbines of the plant . 
[ORG ETA  ] also employed sabotage , letter bombs , hand grenades , kidnappings and targeted assassinations of the chief engineer and director involved in the plant 's construction . 
The campaign resulted in a handful of deaths and wounded several others , which contributed to the [ORG GOS  ] decision in 1983 to discontinue the plant 's construction before it ever became operational. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The radical [MISC Islamist  ] attacks in the [LOC United States  ] on 9/11 and the [LOC Madrid  ] train bombings in 2004 prompted the [ORG GOS  ] to redouble its efforts to secure its nuclear facilities from attack . 
[ORG Al-Qa'ida  ] and al-Qa'ida in the [LOC Islamic Maghreb  ] routinely call for the recapture of the former [MISC Muslim-controlled  ] region in the [LOC Iberian Peninsula  ] they still call " al-Andalus . 
" The [ORG GOS  ] in 2004 passed its Plan for the Development of a Nuclear , Radiological , Biological , and Chemical ( [ORG CBRN  ] ) [ORG Defense System  ] , which assigned 1,682 [ORG Civil Guards  ] to the prevention of and reaction to a [ORG CBRN  ] attack in [LOC Spain  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG National Intelligence Center  ] ( [ORG CNI  ] ) issued a report in 2006 indicating that the most devastating blow that jihadists could strike against [LOC Spain  ] would be by attacking one of [LOC Spain  ] 's nuclear plants. //Spain Requested [ORG IAEA Peer Review of Its Nuclear Regulatory Agency//  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Barcelo  ] , the longest-serving member of the [ORG five-person Commission  ] that constitutes the senior leadership of [LOC Spain  ] 's nuclear regulatory agency , told [PER POLOFF  ] that , in requesting a peer review of its nuclear regulatory infrastructure , the [ORG GOS  ] was motivated to compare its strengths and weakness to [ORG IAEA  ] safety standards and to exchange best practices with other countries . 
While the [LOC UK  ] , [LOC France  ] and [LOC Romania  ] have undergone similar [ORG IAEA  ] peer reviews , [PER Barcelo  ] emphasized to [PER POLOFF  ] that [LOC Spain  ] is the first country to have a " full scope " [ORG IRRS  ] review , which includes a module conducted on nuclear security . 
The [MISC English  ] language version of the [ORG IAEA  ] , s [ORG IRRS  ] final report on [LOC Spain  ] is available at http://www.cs.es/publicaciones/IRRSinglesokok .pdf while the supplemental report on physical security is unavailable to the public . 
( [ORG COMMENT: Note  ] that the [ORG IRRS  ] report addresses how well [LOC Spain  ] 's nuclear regulatory agency takes its responsibilities to develop a regulatory program . 
The report was not intended to directly assess the physical security of [LOC Spain  ] 's nuclear facilities per se , but many of its findings provide useful information for this cable . 
END COMMENT . 
) [PER Barcelo  ] informed [PER POLOFF  ] that the [ORG GOS  ] will be engaged in follow-up activities to the report for the next two or three years. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG IAEA/IRRS  ] report rated the overall results for [LOC Spain  ] as " excellent . 
" The team identified 16 good practices utilized by [LOC Spain  ] , offered 26 suggestions for improvement , and made five general recommendations . 
When applicable , several of the security-related strengths and weaknesses are highlighted in the paragraphs below . 
Among the items listed as an issue for improvement , the [MISC IAEA/IRSS  ] recommended that " nothing should diminish the first priority of [ORG CSN  ] to oversee the safety of the nuclear and radioactive installations " and that [LOC Spain  ] should " continue its focus on ongoing efforts to strengthen [ORG CSN  ] 's activities in physical protection.. . 
" From the supplemental reports on nuclear safety , there were two recommendations . 
First , that that [ORG CSN  ] participate in national radioactive waste management planning . 
Second , [ORG CSN  ] was encouraged to develop a plan and communication of plans for the final disposal of spent fuel and high-level waste . 
( [ORG COMMENT: Spain  ] currently only has a domestic disposal site for medium-level waste . 
END COMMENT . 
) //Specific Security Measures at Nuclear Facilities// <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) One of the areas identified by the [MISC IAEA/IRSS  ] as a strength of [LOC Spain  ] was the collaboration between [ORG CSN  ] and the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] in physical protection-related activities and the use of regulatory and licensing activities to enhance physical security at nuclear facilities . 
According to [MISC Spanish  ] press reports , [MISC Spanish  ] security forces - primarily the [ORG Civil Guard  ] , a paramilitary law enforcement force - and intelligence services are responsible for the external security at [MISC Spanish  ] nuclear facilities while private security guards hired by the owners of the plants have responsibility for the interior of the facilities . 
[PER Barcelo  ] told [PER POLOFF  ] that most of the security guards at [MISC Spanish  ] nuclear facilities are former members of the police or military. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [LOC Spain  ] appears to have made progress since a number of recent high-profile incidents in which the physical security of its nuclear facilities was compromised . 
In 2002 , [ORG Greenpeace  ] activists stormed the [PER Jose Cabrera  ] nuclear facility in [LOC Zorita  ] and scaled the dome of the plant , from which they unfurled a banner with an anti-nuclear message . 
The incident raised concerns about the physical security of the plant , which subsequently was shut down in 2006 . 
Following the [LOC Zorita  ] incident , [ORG CSN  ] recommended that the companies that own [LOC Spain  ] 's nuclear facilities surround them with a double physical barrier . 
According to [MISC Spanish  ] press reports , security at [MISC Spanish  ] nuclear plants has been beefed up since early 2007 , making access to the facilities more difficult . 
A late 2007 article in [LOC Spain  ] 's flagship daily [ORG El Pais  ] details four security checks that workers must pass through at the [LOC Cofrentes  ] nuclear plant in [LOC Valencia  ] . 
The first identify themselves to guards , then pass through a finger-print check before being scanned for metals and explosives and finally undergoing a fourth , unspecified check . 
[ORG CNI  ] reportedly also began conducting more stringent investigations of the nuclear facilities' employees . 
Finally , the article stated that there are two fences around the [LOC Cofrentes  ] facility ; one is electrified and the other has razor wire at the top of it. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) POLOFF also discussed physical security measures at [LOC Spain  ] 's nuclear facilities with an official from the [ORG U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission  ] ( [ORG NRC  ] ) who has been inside the [LOC Cofrentes  ] plant within the past year . 
The [ORG NRC  ] official noted that the [LOC Cofrentes  ] plant has detection systems along its fenceline that include video cameras , motion detection sensors , and infra-red surveillance and described the physical security system as very similar to those at [LOC U.S.  ] nuclear facilities . 
The [ORG NRC  ] official also remarked that physical security measures at the [LOC Cofrentes  ] plant go beyond what is mandated and include an additional measure of " pretty impressive " technology: a camera system in place at the service entrance to the plant which takes an image of the undercarriage of any vehicle passing through . 
The next time that vehicle passes the camera system , the system will take a new image and be able to detect if there have been any alterations since the last visit. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) This [ORG NRC  ] official remarked that the [ORG GOS  ] and the [ORG CSN  ] have taken " very seriously " several recent breaches in the physical security at [MISC Spanish  ] nuclear facilities . 
In mid-2007 , for instance , [ORG Greenpeace  ] again breached the security of a nuclear facility , this time by overflying the [MISC Extremadura-based  ] [LOC Almaraz  ] nuclear facility in a paraglider . 
In the same event , [ORG Greenpeace  ] activists also stormed the [LOC Almaraz  ] facility by a [MISC Zodiac-style  ] speed boat while a third team chained themselves to the front gate . 
( Publicly available photos of the physical removal of the activists from the site show the [LOC Almaraz  ] guards equipped with sidearms and night sticks . 
) According to the [ORG NRC  ] official , the [LOC Cofrentes  ] facility responded to the paraglider incident at [LOC Almaraz  ] by placing a field of razor wire along the roofs of building that house sensitive materials . 
In late September 2007 , guards at the [MISC Juzbado  ] fuel-element producing facility in [LOC Salamanca  ] found uranium tablets along a perimeter fence , in what authorities believe was an attempt by a member of the workforce to smuggle the goods out of the complex . 
[ORG CSN  ] publicly stated shortly thereafter that the tablets could not be used to make a bomb . 
The [ORG NRC  ] official states that the [ORG CSN  ] was quite chagrined by the incident and its potential implications and acted to prevent its reoccurrence. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) Embassy Madrid cannot independently confirm that each of [LOC Spain  ] 's nuclear plants employs similar security precautions to those described in the preceding paragraphs about [LOC Cofrentes  ] , but this [ORG NRC  ] official indicates that the [LOC Cofrentes  ] plant likely employs the physical security standard at which all [MISC Spanish  ] nuclear plants are at or are on target to meet . 
The [ORG NRC  ] official did not believe that the high-level of physical security at the [LOC Cofrentes  ] plant was an anomaly . 
A second [ORG NRC  ] official with whom [ORG POLOFF  ] spoke stressed that there is a long-standing history of bilateral cooperation between the [ORG USG  ] and the [ORG GOS  ] on the physical protection of nuclear facilities , which includes bilateral meetings every few years and periodic meetings and exchanges by security officials. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Unrelated to terrorism concerns but of interest from a safety standpoint , the [MISC Spanish  ] also have experienced a number of accidents at their nuclear plants in the past 15 months . 
[MISC Spanish  ] press reports and anti-nuclear campaigners suggest that cost-cutting efforts by nuclear facilities and the increasing use of subcontractors are resulting in increased safety lapses . 
A radiation leak at the [LOC Asco  ] nuclear plant near [LOC Tarragona  ] in November 2007 occurred when an inexperienced worker dumped radioactive waste in a pool of cooling water . 
Two plant directors were fired for covering up the incident for months before it became public in early 2008 ; an action which prompted [ORG CSN  ] to recommend that the companies be fined up to roughly $30 million . 
Meanwhile , in the summer of 2008 , a pipe carrying hydrogen burst and ignited at the [LOC Vandellos II  ] nuclear plant . 
Together , the two plants were off-line for 114 days in 2008 , compared to 21 in <a id='par2007' href='#par2007'>¶</a>2007. //Transport of Nuclear Materials// <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) [ORG CSN  ] has authority to carry out inspections related to the transport of radioactive material by land , air and sea , focusing on the nuclear safety and radiation protection . 
[ORG CSN  ] conducts about 60 inspections annually . 
The inspections may be planned , reactive , announced or unannounced . 
The [ORG IAEA/IRSS  ] report identified several good practices related to transportation safety , crediting the [ORG CSN  ] for being pro-active and practical in this regard and praising it for maintaining a comprehensive , user-friendly database on the topic. //Plans or Procedures for Responding to the Theft of Nuclear Material// <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) Among its good practices , [LOC Spain  ] was praised by the [ORG IAEA/IRSS  ] for its " well trained emergency preparedness organization " and its " very modern and well equipped emergency center . 
" According to [MISC Spanish  ] press reports , [ORG CSN  ] in the aftermath of 9/11 recommended that the companies that own [LOC Spain  ] 's nuclear facilities have the obligation to notify [ORG CSN  ] 's Emergency Center - within one hour - of any detection of the theft or loss of any nuclear material , including any attempts at sabotage . 
[LOC Spain  ] does have recorded incidents of presumed theft of nuclear material , however , as mentioned in paragraph 9. //Plans or Procedures for Attacks on Nuclear Facilities// <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG CSN  ] does not publicly comment on such security measures and the [ORG IAEA/IRSS  ] supplemental report on physical security was not released to the public . 
However , according to a press report in late 2007 , [MISC Spanish  ] nuclear plants have a retaining wall made of concrete-reinforced steel to surround and protect the reactor from a missile or an airborne terrorist attack . 
These anti-missile " slabs " reportedly employ designs utilized by such [LOC U.S.  ] firms as [ORG Westinghouse  ] or [ORG GE  ] . 
The retaining walls also are reportedly designed to safeguard against seismic activity. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) [LOC Spain  ] is also taking political and operational steps to increase its ability to prevent an attack on its nuclear facilities . 
Throughout 2008 , [LOC Spain  ] had a very active role in the [ORG Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism  ] ( GI ) . 
[LOC Spain  ] hosted a table-top exercise in May , a plenary meeting in June , and a field training exercise in October . 
This series of events further developed [LOC Spain  ] 's expertise in nuclear terrorism-related disaster preparedness and contingency planning . 
As mentioned in [MISC REFTEL  ] C , Madrid also wants to continue to deepen cooperation to combat nuclear terrorism by conducting more technical exercises and training cooperation in 2009 within a multilateral context and bilaterally with the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [ORG POLOFF  ] concluded his meeting with [PER Barcelo  ] by asking how [MISC Spanish  ] nuclear security has evolved since he became a Commissioner of the [ORG CSN  ] in mid-2001 . 
He responded that the [ORG GOS  ] had " good " security measures in place before 9/11 , but their implementation had become " relaxed . 
" [PER Barcelo  ] assured [ORG POLOFF  ] that these types of physical security compromises experienced in recent years could not happen nowadays .
