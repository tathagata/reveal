2008 SECSTATE 128033 Classified By: Deputy Chief of Mission [PER Brian A. Nichols  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b and d ) SUMMARY -------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The signing of a new defense cooperation agreement ( [ORG DCA  ] ) with the [LOC United States  ] is a priority for President [PER Uribe  ] . 
The current negotiations come at a time when the [ORG GOC  ] is eager to cement the historically solid [MISC U.S.-Colombian  ] bilateral relationship under the new [LOC U.S.  ] administration . 
The [ORG GOC  ] and [MISC Colombian  ] people hold positive views of the [LOC United States  ] , and [LOC Colombia  ] sees itself as an unwavering ally in an [MISC Andean  ] region increasingly hostile to [LOC U.S.  ] values and goals . 
The [ORG GOC  ] views the negotiation of a new defense agreement between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Colombia  ] as a key in deterring potential regional threats , but also remains sensitive to domestic and regional considerations regarding the [LOC U.S.  ] military presence in the region . 
The [ORG GOC  ] negotiating team appears to have internal divisions over goals and negotiating tactics , and during the talks the [ORG GOC  ] may seek security guarantees we are unwilling to offer in the [ORG DCA  ] agreement . 
End Summary . 
[ORG GOC  ] NEGOTIATING POSTURE ----------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC Colombian  ] President [PER Alvaro Uribe  ] , Defense Minister [PER Juan Manuel Santos  ] , and Foreign Minister [PER Jaime Bermudez  ] support strong bilateral ties , and see a new defense agreement as a critical component of our relationship . 
The [ORG GOC  ] increasingly views [LOC Venezuela  ] as a threat , especially given recent [MISC Venezuelan  ] arms purchases from [LOC Russia  ] , and views a defense agreement with the [LOC United States  ] as a deterrent to possible [MISC Venezuelan  ] aggression . 
On several occasions , Minister of Defense [PER Santos  ] has alluded to the airlift of supplies from the [LOC United States  ] to [LOC Israel  ] during the 1973 [LOC Yom Kippur  ] war and has requested similar " assurances " from the [ORG USG  ] in the event of a conflict with [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
The language in [ORG Article IV of the October  ] 23 [MISC Colombian  ] counterproposal requesting an aerial defense system and security guarantees in the event of a threat to [LOC Colombia  ] 's national security reflects this concern . 
We have communicated the [LOC U.S.  ] position on the aerial defense system to senior [ORG GOC  ] officials ( per reftel C ) , but expect the issue to be raised during the negotiations. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Despite their enthusiasm for the agreement , [ORG GOC  ] officials stress that the agreement should avoid provoking regional and domestic sensitivities to an enhanced [LOC U.S.  ] military presence . 
They have noted that any agreement should avoid use of the word " base " and should be linked to earlier bilateral and multilateral agreements to avoid the need for [MISC Colombian  ] congressional approval . 
Senior [MISC Colombian  ] officials have repeatedly stated their intent to avoid an agreement that would require [MISC Colombian  ] congressional approval . 
While [MISC Colombian  ] Executive Branch officials strongly support a [ORG DCA  ] , some opposition politicians and opinion leaders have already spoken out against the possibility of " moving the [ORG Manta Base to Colombia  ] . 
" The text of the [ORG GOC  ] October 23 counterproposal is generally consistent with these stated concerns ( see reftel B ) . 
For example , the [ORG GOC  ] deleted the status of forces agreement ( [ORG SOFA  ] ) language and instead links privileges and immunities ( P&Is ) to the earlier 1974 agreement titled " Agreement Between the Government of the [LOC United States  ] of [LOC America  ] and the Government of the [LOC Republic of Colombia  ] Concerning an [ORG Army Mission  ] , a [ORG Naval Mission  ] and an [ORG Air Force Mission  ] of the [LOC United States  ] of [ORG America Armed Forces  ] in the [LOC Republic of Colombia  ] " ( commonly known as the " 1974 Agreement " ) . 
[ORG GOC  ] TEAM DYNAMICS , DIVISIONS ---------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOC  ] technical negotiating team of approximately 20 members will be led by Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Clemencia Forero  ] . 
Two of the three Vice Ministers of Defense , [PER Sergio Jaramillo  ] and [PER Juan Carlos Pinzon  ] , will also participate . 
The [ORG GOC  ] team will also include three additional members from the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) , including [PER Patricia Cortes  ] ( Coordinator for the Office of [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG Canadian Affairs  ] ) , and approximately a dozen others from the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] ( [ORG MOD  ] ) . 
We expect there to be tensions between the [ORG MFA  ] and the [ORG DOD  ] about the defense agreement--with the [ORG MFA  ] being more concerned with not antagonizing [LOC Colombia  ] 's neighbors and more sensitive to national sovereignty concerns , and the [ORG MOD  ] generally favoring a more robust military relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] There are also fissures within the [ORG MOD  ] team , with some favoring a broader agreement with expressly stated defense " guarantees " from the [ORG USG  ] , and others favoring a more narrow , technical agreement . 
It remains to be seen which of these internal [ORG GOC  ] views will prevail during the negotiations . 
REGIONAL TENSIONS ----------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Government of [LOC Ecuador  ] broke diplomatic relations with [LOC Colombia  ] after the [ORG GOC  ] 's March 1 , 2008 bombing of [ORG Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  ] ( [ORG FARC  ] ) Commander [PER Raul Reyes'  ] camp in [LOC Ecuador  ] , and has yet to resume ties . 
Relations with [LOC Venezuela  ] have improved somewhat following recent meetings between Presidents [PER Uribe  ] and [PER Chavez  ] , but [MISC Venezuelan  ] support for the [MISC FARC--as  ] evidenced in the computers found at [PER Raul Reyes'  ] camp and [ORG GOC  ] concerns that [MISC Venezuelan  ] authorities allow the [ORG FARC  ] to move drugs and arms across the border--contributes to continued tensions . 
In May 2008 , following a speculative piece in the [MISC Colombian  ] daily " [ORG El Espectador  ] " that suggested the [ORG Manta  ] " bases " would be moved to [LOC Colombia  ] , [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] warned the [ORG GOC  ] against the approval of a " gringo base " in [ORG La Guajira  ] , Colombia--saying he would consider this an act of aggression . 
Defense Minister [PER Juan Manuel Santos  ] replied that , " I would tell those criticizing this information to become better informed , because there will be no base " ( see reftef A ) . 
The [ORG GOC  ] is eager to keep the upcoming negotiations out of the media spotlight . 
REGIONAL AMBITIONS ------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In addition to a bolstered relationship with the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC Colombia  ] also seeks to play a greater role in the international security architecture , as evidenced by its willingness to contribute troops to [ORG NATO  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and the [ORG Sinai Multinational Observer Force  ] . 
Despite initial skepticism , in July 2008 [LOC Colombia  ] opted to participate in the [ORG South American Defense Council  ] , under the framework of the [ORG Union of South American Nations  ] ( [ORG UNASUR  ] ) , following assurances from [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva  ] that the [ORG Defense Council  ] would operate by consensus . 
[LOC Colombia  ] provides anti-narcotics training to police in [LOC Mexico  ] , [LOC Panama  ] , the [LOC Caribbean  ] and other nations . 
[LOC Mexico  ] is benefiting from [LOC Colombia  ] 's experiences fighting narco-traffickers , and Presidents [PER Uribe  ] and [PER Felipe Calderon  ] are seeking to institutionalize and deepen counter-narcotics cooperation . 
We expect the [ORG GOC  ] to make available the expertise developed in combating the [ORG FARC  ] and narco-trafficking groups for international peacekeeping efforts and other international security activities in the years ahead , although financial constraints will remain an issue .
