Reasons 1.4 ( b ) ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Introduction: Per refs , [PER Jose Dirceu  ] , formerly the most powerful minister in President [PER Lula da Silva  ] 's cabinet and currently a federal deputy subject to possible revocation of his congressional status , is a central figure in the ongoing scandals roiling the government and [ORG PT Party  ] . 
As such , at present he is " too hot " for direct contacts with mission personnel . 
However , [MISC PolCouns  ] , with [ORG COM  ] approval , decided to capitalize on the visit this week to [LOC Brasilia  ] of [ORG WHA Special Advisor Bill Perry  ] -- who was in [LOC Brazil  ] in a semi-private capacity and has known [PER Dirceu  ] for several years personally -- to gauge [PER Dirceu  ] 's views on the political crisis and his own predicament . 
[PER Perry  ] agreed to seek out [PER Dirceu  ] , and met privately with him for breakfast at [PER Dirceu  ] 's apartment in [LOC Brasilia  ] on 17 August . 
[PER Perry  ] subsequently reported the following points and impressions from that conversation , and contributed to the comment in para 6. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Dirceu  ] seemed well and fit , despite the stress of recent weeks . 
He said he had disciplined himself to take regular exercise and have sufficient contact with his family , and he is sleeping reasonably well . 
But [PER Dirceu  ] seemed much less combative than in a meeting with [PER Perry  ] in late June , just after his resignation as Minister of the [ORG Casa Civil  ] . 
Most remarkably , [PER Dirceu  ] claimed he had resigned himself to the fact that he will be " cassado " -- i.e. , suffer the revocation of his congressional seat and right to run again for any office for an eight year period -- probably by [MISC November.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Dirceu  ] predictably considered this unjust and defended his own record . 
His line was that the post-2002 [ORG PT  ] leadership came up with the " hair-brained and perverse " scheme for illegal financing that is at the center of current investigations in response to pressures from small , mercenary allied parties -- the [ORG PTB  ] , [ORG PL  ] , [ORG PP  ] -- and from 2002 campaign media specialist [PER Duda Mendonca  ] . 
In this version , [PER Dirceu  ] had nothing to do with these arrangements . 
Indeed , ex-PT treasurer [PER Delubio Soares  ] was " not his guy " -- [PER Soares  ] came from the labor movement -- and [PER Dirceu  ] never wanted him in such a sensitive post . 
[PER Dirceu  ] also criticized as weak both ex-PT President [PER Jose Genoino  ] and acting [ORG PT  ] president [PER Tarso Genro  ] ( who currently is trying to wrest control of the [ORG PT  ] from the powerful [PER Dirceu  ] faction ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) This defense was interwoven with criticisms by [PER Dirceu  ] of the [PER Lula  ] government . 
[PER Lula  ] does not do much on his own initiative , [PER Dirceu  ] claimed , and he said [PER Lula  ] should have paid more attention to cultivating legitimate corporate funding sources in the wake of 2002 elections . 
He also should have brought the [ORG PMDB  ] and other large , responsible parties into the government earlier and rewarded them with ministerial posts . 
[PER Dirceu  ] said he had wanted to finish up with the ministerial re-shuffle and go back to [ORG Congress  ] long before he could get the president to do anything about it . 
Importantly , [PER Lula  ] is mishandling the current crisis , [PER Dirceu  ] opined. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) As a result of these failings and the unfolding debacle , [PER Dirceu  ] now believes that [PER Lula  ] is unlikely to win re-election next year . 
Indeed , [PER Dirceu  ] said he thinks [PER Lula  ] may not run " if he gets depressed . 
" [PER Dirceu  ] views a PSDB candidate as the probable victor ( [LOC Sao Paulo Mayor  ] [PER Jose Serra  ] was his forecast ) , but he does not think a [MISC PSDB-led  ] administration will be able to govern effectively . 
[PER Dirceu  ] was more optimistic about the future of the [ORG PT  ] , at least after a few years of rehabilitation and recovery . 
[PER Dirceu  ] said he thinks his faction will win again in the September party election , thus continuing its domination of the [ORG PT.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment . 
[PER Dirceu  ] disassociated himself utterly from any blame for the scandals engulfing his party and [PER Lula  ] government , and sustained the " I knew nothing " defense of his recent testimony before the congressional ethics committee . 
Both positions are widely regarded as ludicrous by [MISC Brazilian  ] politicians and journalists who have followed [PER Dirceu  ] 's career and understand both the extent of his power within the GOB as a minister and the iron grip he exerts over the [ORG PT  ] even today . 
We share in the skepticism . 
Beyond that , the sincerity of [PER Dirceu  ] 's professions about his own future may be doubted , given his long and extraordinary personal history of a single-minded pursuit of power . 
But , to be fair , perhaps he is being realistic . 
It looks highly likely that [PER Dirceu  ] will , in fact , lose his congressional mandate and political rights . 
Further , the wounds inflicted by the crisis on [PER Lula  ] -- who is [PER Dirceu  ] 's creature , in many ways -- together with new polls that show [PER Lula  ] losing to PSDB candidates , suggest [PER Lula  ] 's era may be waning . 
For now the only things for [PER Dirceu  ] to do are try to avoid further serious charges , preserve a measure of behind-the-scenes influence through domination of the [ORG PT  ] by his faction , and , at 59 , make the most of the rest of his life . 
On this , he mused on some specific possibilities , including leaving [LOC Brazil  ] for several months to go to the [LOC US  ] for the purpose of learning [MISC English  ] and writing a book . 
[PER Dirceu  ] 's departure from the political scene would be a watershed , closing out a distinctive chapter in modern [MISC Brazilian  ] politics . 
Yet we cannot quite bring ourselves to believe that this ruthless and brilliant chameleon is willing to go so quietly into the night -- not just yet .
