-- SUMMARY: [ORG SCSL  ] MEETS A KEY MILESTONE , BUT FACES UNCERTAINTY IN TERMS OF TIMING , FINANCES , AND COMPLETION ISSUES -- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On February 27 , 2009 , the [ORG Special Court for Sierra Leone  ] ( [ORG SCSL  ] or Court ) took another step toward completing its work when the [ORG Prosecution  ] rested its case against former [MISC Liberian  ] President [PER Charles Taylor  ] -- the last [ORG SCSL  ] case at the trial stage . 
The Court could potentially complete its work before the end of 2010 . 
A number of open issues , however , may affect timing , including the start date and length of the [ORG Taylor Defense  ] case . 
Timing may be particularly important given expected funding shortfalls and the possible loss of courtroom space this coming September . 
Additionally , the current [MISC Registrar  ] , [PER Herman  ] von [PER Hebel  ] ( [LOC Netherlands  ] ) , has resigned effective June 1 , and his successor will inherit a host of difficult issues and a complex transition during the final days of the Court , s operations. --BACKGROUND: A SMALL COURT WITH SEVERAL FIRSTS -- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) A Trailblazing Court . 
The hybrid [ORG SCSL  ] , created in 2002 through an agreement between the [ORG United Nations  ] and the Government of [LOC Sierra Leone  ] ( [LOC GOSL  ] ) and funded entirely by voluntary contributions , has jurisdiction over those who bear the greatest responsibility for serious violations of international humanitarian law and [MISC Sierra Leonean  ] law committed in [LOC Sierra Leone  ] after November 30 , 1996 . 
Although established almost ten years after the creation of the [ORG International Criminal Tribunals  ] for the former [LOC Yugoslavia  ] and [LOC Rwanda  ] ( [ORG ICTY  ] and [ORG ICTR  ] ) , the [ORG SCSL  ] is poised to complete its work before these tribunals . 
The [ORG SCSL  ] has also been the first internationalized criminal tribunal to: 1 ) issue an indictment for an [MISC African  ] head of state ( [MISC Liberian  ] President [PER Charles Taylor  ] ) ; 2 ) enter convictions for the crime of recruiting and using child soldiers ; and 3 ) successfully prosecute forced marriage as a crime against humanity and intentional attacks on [ORG U.N.  ] peacekeepers as a serious violation of international humanitarian law. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Last Trial Standing . 
In 2003 , the [ORG SCSL  ] indicted [PER Charles Taylor  ] , the leader of the [ORG National Patriotic Front of Liberia  ] from 1989 to 1997 and the President of [LOC Liberia  ] from 1997 until the 2003 indictment . 
The indictment alleges [PER Taylor  ] , s deep involvement in the [LOC Sierra Leone  ] conflict including his role in arming , training and acting in concert with the [ORG RUF  ] and in trafficking the [MISC Sierra Leonean  ] &blood diamonds8 that fueled and financed the fighting . 
The [ORG SCSL  ] charged [PER Taylor  ] with eleven counts , including , inter alia , terrorizing the civilian population , unlawful killings , sexual violence , abductions and forced labor , and conscripting child soldiers . 
) ) TIMING: [PER TAYLOR  ] TRIAL’S LINK TO CLOSING [ORG SCSL  ] ) ) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Status of Trial . 
As the only ongoing [ORG SCSL  ] trial , the [PER Taylor  ] trial is the linchpin to the [ORG SCSL  ] completing its work . 
From April 6-9 , 2009 , the Court held the &judgment of acquittal8 hearing , with [ORG Defense  ] arguing for acquittal on all of the charges . 
( Comment: In the &judgment of acquittal8 hearing , the Court considers whether [ORG Prosecution Qacquittal8  ] hearing , the Court considers whether [ORG Prosecution  ] has presented any evidence that could sustain conviction on the charges , acquitting only if [ORG Prosecution  ] has presented &no evidence8 to sustain the charge . 
End Comment . 
) In this hearing , [ORG Defense  ] acknowledged that crimes had occurred in [LOC Sierra Leone  ] but argued that the [ORG Prosecution  ] had failed to 1 ) present evidence linking [PER Taylor  ] to those crimes and 2 ) establish that [PER Taylor  ] had been part of a joint criminal enterprise ( [ORG JCE  ] ) because , if a [ORG JCE  ] existed , it existed before November 30 , 1996 , the date at which the temporal jurisdiction of the [ORG SCSL  ] begins . 
The [ORG Prosecution  ] responded to these arguments by summarizing [PER Taylor  ] , s responsibility for the crimes and pointing to [PER Taylor  ] , s liability for [ORG JCE  ] crimes committed after November 30 , 1996 , even if the planning of the [ORG JCE  ] took place before that date . 
( Comment: The Court will most likely not issue its Rule 98 decision in April , especially since the Judges may recess through May . 
An acquittal does not seem likely . 
End Comment . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Next [ORG Up: Defense Case  ] . 
A contact in the [ORG Registry  ] has indicated that [MISC Defense  ] will likely request three months to prepare for trial and four months to present its case . 
If the Court grants this request , the [MISC Defense  ] case may start at the end of August . 
However , the same [ORG Registry  ] source predicts that the [ORG Trial Chamber  ] may order [MISC Defense  ] to begin its case as early as June , working through July and August with a possible recess in September . 
One wild-card factor , however , is the [MISC Defense  ] , s pending interlocutory appeal arguing that the [ORG Prosecution  ] failed to properly plead the [ORG JCE  ] theory of liability . 
The [ORG Trial Chamber  ] may not schedule the [MISC Defense  ] case before the appeals decision so the [MISC Defense  ] knows which mode ( s ) of liability it must defend against . 
( Comment: Currently , the [ORG Registry  ] , s budget milestone document projects an October 31 trial termination date , a March 2010 judgment , sentencing in April 2010 , and the conclusion of appeals in October 2010 . 
If , however , the [MISC Defense  ] case starts in August , the timeline could be pushed back by approximately two months . 
End Comment . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) Spill-Over Timing Effects . 
A delay in the timing for the [PER Taylor  ] trial may create additional challenges . 
First , the [ORG International Criminal Court  ] ( [ORG ICC  ] ) , the location of the [PER Taylor  ] trial , has informed the [ORG SCSL  ] that it will need its second courtroom as of September 2009 . 
( The [ORG ICC  ] scheduled its second trial to start September 24th , and will likely need the courtroom prior to September 24th for pre-trial work ) . 
Back-up options explored by the [ORG Registry  ] include finding other space or working during gaps in the [ORG ICC  ] schedule . 
Second , according to [ORG Registry  ] sources , each additional month of trial time costs approximately one million dollars . 
) ) THE JUDICIAL FACTOR ) ) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Judges Slowing Things Down ? 
Further muddying timing predictions , Court employees have intimated that the [ORG Trial Chamber  ] could work more expeditiously . 
The [ORG Taylor Chamber  ] consists of three judges who take turns presiding: [PER Justice Richard Lussick  ] ( [LOC Samoa  ] ) , [PER Justice Teresa Doherty  ] ( [LOC Northern Ireland  ] ) and [PER Justice Julia Sebutinde  ] ( [LOC Uganda  ] ) , along with an alternate judge , [PER Justice El Hadji Malick Sow  ] ( [LOC Senegal  ] ) . 
A couple of Court employees have grumbled that when the last [ORG Prosecution  ] witness testified on January 30 , 2009 , the [ORG Court  ] still had 11 outstanding motions , some over a year old . 
Additionally , one [ORG Chamber  ] contact believes that the [ORG Trial Chamber  ] could have accelerated the Court , s work by excluding extraneous material and arguments . 
Moreover , contacts in [ORG Prosecution  ] and [ORG Registry  ] speculate that [PER Justice Sebutinde  ] may have a timing agenda . 
They think she , as the only [MISC African  ] judge , wants to hold the gavel as presiding judge when the [ORG Trial Chamber  ] announces the [PER Taylor  ] judgment . 
Reportedly , her next stint as presiding judge begins in January. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Expedited Appeals ? 
The [ORG Appeals Chamber  ] , with one empty seat , consists of President [PER Renate Winter  ] ( [LOC Austria  ] ) ; Vice President [PER Jon Kamanda  ] ( [LOC Sierra Leone  ] ) ; Justice [PER George Gelaga King  ] ( [LOC Sierra Leone  ] ) ; and [PER Justice Emmanuel Ayoola  ] ( [LOC Nigeria  ] ) . 
President [PER Winter  ] reportedly has indicated that the [ORG Appeals Chamber  ] intends to expedite any [PER Taylor  ] trial [ORG Qthe Appeals Chamber  ] intends to expedite any [PER Taylor  ] trial appeals . 
Up for election in May , [PER Winter  ] may not , however , preside over the [ORG Appeals Chamber  ] for any [PER Taylor  ] trial appeals , reportedly she will step down after the [ORG RUF  ] appeal if she is not re-elected President . 
) ) DEFENSE STRATEGY: WHO ME ? ) ) <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Drama-Bound Defense Case  ] . 
A [MISC British  ] Queen , s [ORG Counsel  ] , [PER Courtenay Griffiths  ] , heads [PER Charles Taylor  ] , s top-notch and quick-tongued defense team , which reportedly finds itself in the midst of identifying and proofing witnesses . 
All signs indicate that [PER Taylor  ] himself will take the stand as their first witness possibly staying in the box for 6 to 8 weeks , and based on Defense , s actions to date , the Defense team will likely argue that although the crimes may have occurred , [PER Taylor  ] has no link to the crimes . 
) ) AN IMMINENT BUDGET CRISIS ) ) <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Funding Shortfall . 
The [ORG Registry  ] fears that the Court will run out of money as early as next month , although an expected [MISC Canadian  ] [ORG USD  ] 6 million contribution would keep the Court financed until early July 2009 . 
In a marathon campaign , [PER Registrar Von Hebel  ] attended 250 meetings in 15 months to drum up funds from potential donor countries , but with , according [PER Von Hebel  ] , little traction , due to donor fatigue , the difficult economic situation , and contributions going to other tribunals ( e.g. , the [ORG Special Tribunal  ] for [LOC Lebanon  ] ( [ORG STL  ] ) or the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of [LOC Cambodia  ] ) . 
[PER Von Hebel  ] wants to make another run at the [MISC Arab  ] countries of [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC Qatar  ] , [LOC Kuwait  ] , and the [LOC United Arab Emirates  ] . 
He also believes that a letter from [ORG U.N.  ] Secretary General [PER Ban Ki-Moon  ] asking countries to contribute might help open wallets . 
According to [PER Von Hebel  ] , when [PER Ban  ] sent out a similar letter in 2007 , a number of countries made first-time donations . 
In addition , a couple of traditional donor countries have advised him they may need a similar letter in order to donate this year. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) Cost-cutting [MISC Measures: Concerned  ] about the looming financial crisis , the [ORG Registry  ] has undertaken cost-saving measures , reducing staffing costs by downsizing , incorporating liquidation clauses in contracts , and encouraging The [LOC Hague  ] staff to use leave during the break between prosecution and defense cases . 
The [ORG Registry  ] also plans to hand over the [LOC Freetown  ] facilities to the [ORG GOSL  ] in July 2010 , reserving some space for its own continued use . 
Finally , [ORG Registry  ] may look to consolidate the [ORG Appeals Chamber  ] and the [PER Taylor  ] trial operations in The [LOC Hague  ] , after the [ORG Appeals Chamber  ] finalizes the [ORG RUF  ] appeal. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Help from [LOC Washington  ] . 
The [ORG Registry  ] may also seek [ORG USG  ] , s assistance on financial issues . 
First , it may press the [ORG USG  ] not to reduce its FY2009 contribution by 2 million , but to stay at last year , s level of 9 million [ORG USD  ] . 
( Comment: The extra sum would not solve the Court , s immediate financial problem , since the [ORG USG  ] generally contributes in the fall . 
End Comment . 
) Second , the [ORG Registry  ] may ask for [ORG USG  ] political support in the form of demarches to [MISC Arab  ] countries , impressing upon the targeted [MISC Arab  ] countries the critical nature of the [ORG SCSL  ] , s financial situation . 
) ) COMPLETION HICCUPS AND ISSUES ) ) <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Registrar Musical Chairs  ] . 
On April 8 , 2009 , the Court announced [ORG Registrar  ] von [PER Hebel  ] , s resignation , effective as of June 1 , 2009 . 
[PER Von Hebel  ] will assume the Deputy [ORG Registrar  ] position at the newly established [MISC Hague-based  ] [ORG STL  ] . 
( According to Embassy contacts , [ORG STL  ] offered [PER Von Hebel  ] the position at the insistence of and to placate the [MISC Dutch  ] , who believe the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG ICTY Registrar  ] had been treated unfairly when the [ORG ICTY  ] President unexpectedly declined to renew his contract ) . 
Given that the [ORG STL  ] Registrar [PER Robin Vincent  ] ( [LOC U.K  ] . 
) recently resigned , [PER Von Hebel  ] may eventually step into [PER Vincent  ] , s shoes . 
[PER Von Hebel  ] is also tying up as many [ORG SCSL  ] loose ends as possible , including signing a sentence-enforcement agreement with the Government of [LOC Rwanda  ] . 
In terms of a successor [ORG Registrar  ] , a [ORG Registry  ] contact believes that the current Deputy Registrar [PER Binta Mansaray  ] ( [LOC Sierra Leone  ] ) will surface as a strong candidate .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) A Larger Role for The [LOC Hague  ] ? 
Although currently headquartered in [LOC Freetown  ] , [LOC Sierra Leone  ] , the [ORG Registry  ] has toyed with the possibility of locating any [ORG Residual Mechanism  ] Qtoyed with the possibility of locating any [ORG Residual Mechanism  ] ) or parts thereof ) in The [LOC Hague  ] . 
For instance , [PER Von Hebel  ] believes that the Court may need to move its archives out of [LOC Sierra Leone  ] in order to properly maintain and secure them . 
The [ORG City of The Hague  ] has indicated its willingness to provide archiving facilities in connection with the [ORG ICTY  ] , s closure . 
Some have also suggested combining some or part of the [ORG SCSL  ] , s residual functions with those of The [MISC Hague-based  ] [ORG ICTY  ] and the [MISC Arusha-based  ] [ORG ICTR  ] . 
A combined residual mechanism might prevent duplication , but it would also face significant hurdles , given [ORG SCSL  ] , s structural differences , e.g. funding , oversight mechanism and applicable legal framework . 
Furthermore , [ORG GOSL  ] desires will be key , since a joint [MISC GOSL-UN  ] agreement created the Court .
