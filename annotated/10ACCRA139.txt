END SUMMARY. ---------------------------- TRANSPARENCY IN OIL REVENUES ---------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Assistant Secretary [PER Carson  ] , accompanied by the Ambassador , Special Assistant Cook and Econoff , met with President [PER John Atta-Mills  ] on February 3 , 2010 . 
[PER Carson  ] strongly emphasized the need for leadership in ensuring that [MISC Ghana’s  ] oil resources are managed for the benefit of the country . 
He stressed the importance of adherence to rule of law and transparency to maintain [MISC Ghana’s  ] attractiveness for investment and its ultimate success in developing its oil resources . 
[PER Mills  ] said he is determined to ensure oil will be a blessing , but that a number of corrupt ( unnamed ) oil company representatives have attempted to bribe him . 
He said that he refused the money and was offended by their efforts. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Mills  ] stated without reservation that he was committed to the rule of law and transparency . 
He also added that [LOC Ghana  ] would account for all oil revenues in a transparent manner . 
He noted that he had recently sent a Right to Information bill to Parliament that would increase transparency . 
He said he regarded governance of the oil sector as a serious responsibility , and stressed that oil revenues belong to the people of [LOC Ghana  ] , not their political leaders . 
He said that [LOC Ghana  ] has faced challenges , but that its leadership will do what is right. ------------------------------- KOSMOS OFFENDED PRESIDENT [PER MILLS  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Carson  ] stressed the importance of fair and legal processes as oil development ramps up . 
He cautioned that , once tarnished , the image of [LOC Ghana  ] would be difficult to improve . 
[PER Mills  ] agreed and said that he has spent many hours discussing the importance of rule of law with his officials . 
He stressed that many [MISC Ghanaian  ] officials were educated in the [LOC U.S.  ] , so they are not inclined to discriminate against [MISC American  ] companies . 
That said , [PER Mills  ] claimed that many of the petroleum agreements negotiated under the former administration were inexplicably very different from each other , implying that some contracts were gained unfairly . 
He gave no details on what contracts he felt might be unfair. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Mills  ] emphasized the importance of respect in dealing with the [ORG GOG  ] , claiming multiple offenses by [ORG Kosmos Energy  ] . 
[PER Mills  ] claimed that [ORG Kosmos  ] initially denied that they were planning to sell their asset in the [LOC Jubilee Field  ] when they were rumored to be interested in selling . 
Later , when [ORG Kosmos  ] announced their intention to sell , he said the [ORG GOG  ] expressed [ORG ACCRA  ] 00000139 002 OF 004 interest in buying shares . 
According to President [PER Mills  ] , [ORG Kosmos  ] invited a delegation to go to [LOC London  ] to discuss a potential sale , but before the meeting the CEO of [ORG ExxonMobil  ] informed [PER Mills  ] that [ORG Exxon  ] had entered into an exclusive agreement with [ORG Kosmos  ] to purchase the asset . 
[PER Mills  ] acknowledged the right of [ORG Exxon  ] to enter into such an agreement , but said that he felt both [LOC Ghana  ] and he personally had been misled and disrespected by [ORG Kosmos  ] . 
[PER Mills  ] seemed to separate [ORG ExxonMobil  ] from [ORG Kosmos  ] to a degree , praising [MISC ExxonMobil’s  ] expertise in oil exploration and production . 
[PER Mills  ] raised the problem of [ORG Kosmos  ] letting other companies view sensitive data in what he described as a violation of [MISC Ghanaian  ] law . 
He said that according to [MISC Ghanaian  ] law , [ORG GOG  ] consent is required before such access can be granted , and that [ORG Kosmos  ] had allowed 26 companies to view the data . 
[PER Mills  ] asserted that [ORG Kosmos  ] has not been transparent in their dealings with the [ORG GOG  ] , but that the [ORG GOG  ] will adhere to transparency and rule of law in its dealings with [ORG Kosmos  ] . 
He also said that he did not want to create the impression that the [ORG GOG  ] is singling out any one company for mistreatment. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) ( NOTE: Two days prior , the Minister of Energy wrote a letter to [ORG ExxonMobil  ] CEO [PER Tillerson  ] , saying the [ORG GOG  ] is unable to support an [ORG ExxonMobil  ] acquisition of [ORG Kosmos’s Ghana  ] assets as long as the companies retain their exclusivity agreement and deny the [ORG GOG  ] a role in the asset acquisition process . 
The Ambassador already raised objections to statements in the [ORG ExxonMobil  ] letter with the Minister of [ORG Trade and Industry  ] and the [ORG Foreign Affairs Advisor  ] to the President . 
END NOTE . 
) Assistant Secretary [PER Carson  ] thanked [PER Mills  ] for his candor and agreed with the need for transparency and courtesy in business deals . 
He stressed again , however , the absolute importance of adhering to the rule of law and transparency in resolving any disagreements with [ORG Kosmos  ] and [ORG Exxon.  ] ------------------------------------ OBSERVATION MISSION IN [LOC GUINEA  ] LIKELY ------------------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Assistant Secretary [PER Carson  ] asked if the [ORG GOG  ] supported an observation mission of 30-40 civilians , diplomats , and military to monitor developments in [LOC Guinea  ] . 
[PER Mills  ] agreed and expressed confidence that [ORG ECOWAS  ] would approve the mission at its upcoming meeting in [LOC Abuja  ] on February 15 . 
He noted that [LOC Ghana  ] condemned [ORG Guinea’s  ] government after the September 28 massacre , a stance [PER Mills  ] described as difficult . 
He said the military had no right to take power , and [LOC Ghana  ] wants to see a return to normality. --------------------------------------------- ------------- [LOC GHANA  ] ENCOURAGING FREE ELECTIONS IN [LOC TOGO  ] AND [LOC COTE D’IVOIRE  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Assistant Secretary [PER Carson  ] brought up the importance of peaceful elections in [LOC Togo  ] . 
[PER Mills  ] described a close relationship with [MISC Togolese  ] President [PER Faure Gnassingbe  ] . 
[PER Mills  ] said he has spoken to him on multiple occassions about the need for free , fair , transparent and peaceful elections . 
Based on their private conversations , [PER Mills  ] expressed confidence that his intention to maintain peace is sincere , but he needs moral support and encouragement . 
[PER Mills  ] said that he also visited [PER Cote  ] d’Ivoire and urged President [PER Gbagbo  ] to hold free , fair , transparent and peaceful elections. --------------------------------------------- ------------- [LOC GHANA  ] WANTS DEMOCRATIC SOLUTION TO THE ABSENCE OF [MISC NIGERIAN  ] PRESIDENT --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Assistant Secretary [PER Carson  ] described the absence of [MISC Nigerian  ] President [PER Yar’Adua  ] as a political vacuum , and stressed the need for democracy , stability , and adherence to the laws and constitution of [LOC Nigeria  ] . 
[PER Mills  ] agreed and said he found the situation in [LOC Nigeria  ] difficult to understand , [ORG ACCRA  ] 00000139 003.2 OF 004 because under [MISC Ghanaian  ] law the Vice President always assumes the President’s duties when the President is out of the country , even if only for a short time . 
He said that [LOC Nigeria  ] must follow a democratic path , or it could trigger “unfortunate developments.” ---------------------------------- CHALLENGES IN REDUCING CHILD LABOR ---------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Assistant Secretary [PER Carson  ] praised the improvements [LOC Ghana  ] has made with regard to combating the worst forms of child labor , but urged a continuing commitment to progress , including in the cocoa industry . 
[PER Mills  ] acknowledged that criticisms against [LOC Ghana  ] for child labor are valid , but described major challenges . 
Many areas where children work do not have schools . 
He praised the work that [ORG USAID  ] and [ORG MCC  ] have done to build schools , and was hopeful that as education opportunities increase , child labor will decrease . 
In addition , parents often want to pass on traditional work skills to their children . 
He noted that some cases of child labor can be valid , such as the work he did on his family farm on weekends and vacations as a youth . 
[PER Mills  ] , however , was firm in his disapproval of any work that interferes with education . 
The Assistant Secretary urged President [PER Mills  ] to ensure that [LOC Ghana  ] continues to focus on progress on the issue , noting that it is viewed very seriously in the [LOC U.S.  ] and has very specific attention in [LOC Congress.  ] ------------------------------------ COUNTER-NARCOTICS COOPERATION VALUED ------------------------------------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Assistant Secretary [PER Carson  ] expressed great concern about increasing drug trafficking in [LOC West Africa  ] , and stressed the need for sustained USG-GOG cooperation to combat it . 
[PER Mills  ] said he was grateful for [LOC U.S.  ] cooperation and acknowledged that many problems in [LOC West Africa  ] can be traced back to trafficking . 
He explained that some countries in the region do not have the capacity to enforce their CN laws , but he is personally committed to enforcement in [LOC Ghana  ] . 
For example , whenever he leaves [LOC Ghana  ] , he asks to be screened to demonstrate that all travelers , even those departing from the [MISC VIP  ] lounge , should be screened . 
He was also concerned that [LOC Ghana  ] is no longer just a transit point for drugs , but is becoming a user country , and said that drug use would lead to a bleak future for the [MISC Ghanaian  ] people . 
He thanked the [ORG USG  ] for provision of a body scanner and noted that he would like assistance in acquiring a second scanner for use in the [MISC VIP  ] area . 
He also added that the [ORG GOG  ] is working to strengthen the navy to target drug-carrying ships , but that he would discuss the matter in greater detail with the Ambassador. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) COMMENT . 
As usual , [LOC Ghana  ] has shown that it will strongly and publicly oppose any unconstitutional changes of power in the region . 
On the issue of oil , however , we are concerned that President Mills’s very real personal commitment to rule of law and transparency may not be reflected in the real life treatment of investors . 
President Mills’s sense that [ORG Kosmos  ] has not treated the [ORG GOG  ] with respect and transparency is problematic , but his clear acceptance of the primacy of rule of law should ultimately counterbalance this . 
Perhaps significantly , [PER Mills  ] stopped well short of statements in recent letters from the Minister of Energy and [ORG GNPC  ] to [ORG ExxonMobil  ] and [ORG Kosmos  ] saying that the [ORG GOG  ] would not support the sale of [ORG Kosmos’s  ] asset under the firms’ current agreement . 
He was positive in his statements about [ORG ExxonMobil  ] . 
There may still be room to create positive outcomes for [ORG Kosmos  ] and [ORG ExxonMobil  ] in [LOC Ghana  ] . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) Assistant Secretary [PER Carson  ] has cleared this message .
