( U ) [PER Mariano Rajoy  ] , the embattled head of [LOC Spain  ] 's main opposition [ORG Partido Popular  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) , was re-elected as party leader on June 21 during the three-day [ORG PP  ] congress held in [LOC Valencia  ] . 
As reported in [LOC REFTEL  ] , [PER Rajoy  ] 's leadership had been challenged on several fronts since his party lost a second straight national election to President [PER Zapatero  ] 's [MISC Spanish  ] Socialist [ORG Workers Party  ] ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) and it was unclear if he would be able to hold on to power . 
Over the past few weeks , would-be challengers found insufficient support for their candidacy to unseat [PER Rajoy  ] and faded back into the woodwork , leaving [PER Rajoy  ] to run unopposed . 
He further distanced himself from the shadow of former President [PER Jose Maria Aznar  ] by announcing a younger , more moderate party secretariat on June 19 that won plaudits from even left-leaning national newspapers , and now appears to be basking in the glory of a successfully-completed party congress . 
However , many in [LOC Spain  ] believe [PER Rajoy  ] has overcome only the first in a long series of leadership battles in advance of the next round of national elections in 2012 , and he will need to show positive results in off-year regional and [MISC European  ] elections if he hopes to have a third consecutive chance to grab the brass ring of the [MISC Spanish  ] presidency. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Approximately 3,025 [ORG PP  ] delegates gathered from 20-22 June in the seaside city of [LOC Valencia  ] , [LOC Spain  ] , to approve the party 's political platform for the next four years , under the motto " We [MISC Grow Together  ] . 
" Over 84% of these delegates voted for [PER Rajoy  ] to continue as party leader . 
This vote tally was the lowest of any [ORG PP  ] leader since the party was reformed in 1989 , but should serve to silence critics for now . 
[PER Rajoy  ] was coming off a tough 100-day period following the March 9 election loss and had to deal with tumult and dissension in his party 's ranks and open criticism from staunch [ORG PP  ] members such as [LOC Madrid Regional President  ] [PER Esperanza Aguirre  ] , former Interior Minister [PER Jaime Mayor Oreja  ] , [ORG Congressional  ] foreign policy spokesman [PER Gustavo Aristegui  ] , party communications secretary [PER Gabriel Elorriaga  ] , and [ORG PP  ] campaign strategist [PER Juan Costa  ] . 
In addition , the popular leader of the [ORG PP  ] 's political allies in the [LOC Basque Country  ] , [PER Maria San Gil  ] , stated publicly in May that she had lost confidence in the leadership of [PER Rajoy  ] and his team . 
Nevertheless , opposition to [PER Rajoy  ] proved to be a mile wide and an inch deep and faded away once it became clear that no single alternative candidate had enough support to overthrow the sitting leader. //COMMENT// <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( SBU ) [PER Rajoy  ] appears to have put to rest for the time being any doubts about his [ORG PP  ] leadership , and his new team is receiving generally positive reviews from across the political spectrum . 
Pundits are highlighting not only the collective experience and competence of the group gained from positions at the local , regional , and national levels , but also their backgrounds ( including a single working mother ) designed to present a more moderate face and hopefully appeal to a wider swath of [MISC Spanish  ] voters . 
We believe [PER Rajoy  ] is definitely strengthened coming out of the party conference and has a mandate to reform the party in his own image--but his new team will be expected to achieve results quickly if he hopes to lead the party 's national ticket in 2012 . 
As we have reportedly previously , we believe [PER Rajoy  ] owes his longevity as much as anything to the lack of a credible successor within his own party , but many are waiting in the wings should he stumble again . 
Key off-year elections are coming up in the [LOC Basque Country  ] ( scheduled for early 2009 ) , [PER Galicia  ] ( June 2009 ) , and the [MISC European  ] Parliament ( June 2009 ) , and [ORG PP  ] supporters will demand to see positive results as reward for having remained patient while [PER Rajoy  ] finds his way .
