The [ORG EU  ] officials welcomed [PER Froman  ] , s call for stronger bilateral cooperation to boost our economies , improve coordination on climate , [LOC Doha  ] and financial regulation , and push back against coordinated opposition of [ORG BASIC  ] countries ( [LOC China  ] , [LOC India  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC South Africa  ] ) to our international positions . 
They also appreciated the Ambassador , s message that they must capitalize on the [ORG Obama Administration  ] commitment to multilateralism to secure with the [LOC U.S.  ] concrete achievements to strengthen growth and create jobs. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG DNSA  ] [PER Froman  ] and [PER Hedegaard  ] committed to work closely to define the right [MISC Post-Copenhagen  ] climate negotiating group and process , and agreed to hold a [ORG DVC  ] prior to the February 11 [ORG European Council  ] . 
[PER Froman  ] and [PER De Gucht  ] committed to share ideas to improve the [ORG Transatlantic Economic Council  ] ( [ORG TEC  ] ) , with [PER De Gucht  ] planning a February-March [ORG DC  ] visit to discuss [ORG TEC  ] and trade issues . 
[PER Froman  ] , [PER Barnier  ] , and lunch attendees agreed on the importance of bilateral coordination to improve G20 and other work on financial reform .

Finally , [PER Froman  ] expressed [LOC U.S.  ] support for the new [ORG EU Lisbon Treaty  ] structure ; the officials explained that the [ORG EU  ] will need time to adjust to the new format but should emerge with better , more streamlined decisionmaking . 
END SUMMARY . 
A PACKED AGENDA WITH SENIOR [ORG EU  ] OFFICIALS ---------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Deputy [ORG National Security Advisor for International Affairs Michael Froman  ] held intense , broad-ranging discussions with [ORG EU  ] and Member State officials on January 27 enroute to the [MISC Davos World Economic Forum  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Kennard  ] accompanied [PER Froman  ] throughout the day . 
[PER Froman  ] met with [MISC European  ] Commissioners-designate for Climate [PER Connie Hedegaard  ] and for [ORG Internal Markets  ] [PER Michel Barnier  ] , current Development Commissioner and [ORG Commissioner-designate  ] for Trade [PER Karel de Gucht  ] ( plus staff for all ) , and new [ORG European Council  ] President [PER Herman Von Rompuy  ] , s chief of staff [MISC Frans  ] [PER Van Daele  ] . 
[PER Froman  ] also met briefly with [ORG Commission  ] President [PER Jose Manuel Barroso  ] and with Director General for [ORG External Relations Joao Vale  ] de [PER Almeida  ] . 
[PER Froman  ] attended a lunch hosted by [ORG Vale  ] de [PER Almeida  ] featuring: - [PER Marco Buti  ] , Director General for [ORG Economic  ] and [ORG Financial Affairs Jonathan Faull  ] , Director General for Justice , [ORG Freedom and Security  ] - [PER Antonio Cabral  ] , President [PER Barroso  ] Senior [ORG Economic Policy  ] Adviser - [PER Fernando Andresen Guimaraes  ] , President [PER Barroso Diplomatic Adviser  ] - [PER James Morrison  ] , [PER Head  ] of [LOC Cabinet  ] for High Representative and [ORG Commission  ] Vice President [PER Catherine Ashton  ] - [PER Olivier Guersent  ] , [PER Head  ] of [LOC Cabinet  ] for [ORG Commissioner-designate  ] for [ORG Internal Market and Services  ] [PER Michel Barnier  ] - [PER Timo Pesonen  ] , [PER Head  ] of [LOC Cabinet  ] for [ORG Commissioner-designate  ] for [ORG Economic  ] and [ORG Financial Affairs Ollie Rehn  ] - [PER Mark Vanheukelen  ] , [PER Head  ] of [LOC Cabinet  ] of [ORG Commissioner-designate  ] for Trade [PER Karel de Gucht  ] - [PER Alan Seatter  ] , Director for [LOC North America  ] in Directorate General for [ORG External Relations  ] - [PER Jean Claude Thebault  ] , new [ORG Commission  ] Deputy Secretary General [LOC BRUSSELS  ] 00000183 002 OF 007 <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Froman  ] and the Ambassador ended with a roundtable including Member State Permanent Representation ( [LOC COREPER II  ] ) Ambassadors from: [LOC Austria  ] ( [PER Hans Dietmar Schwiesgut  ] ) ; [LOC Belgium  ] ( [PER Jean De Ruyt  ] ) ; [LOC Denmark  ] ( [PER Poul Skytte Christoffersen  ] ) ; [LOC France  ] ( [PER Philippe Etienne  ] ) ; [LOC Italy  ] ( [PER Fernando Nelli  ] Feroci ) ; [LOC Poland  ] ( [PER Jan Tombinski  ] ) ; [LOC Sweden  ] ( [PER Christian Danielsson  ] ) ; and the [LOC UK  ] ( [PER Kim Darroch  ] ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Discussions centered around six themes: the need to improve [MISC U.S.-EU  ] bilateral coordination on a range of transnational issues ( including climate , [LOC Doha  ] and financial reform ) , to avoid repeating what [PER Froman  ] termed &disappointments8 of 2009 and to meet the rising challenge of surprisingly united [ORG BASIC  ] countries ( [LOC China  ] , [LOC India  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC South Africa  ] ) ; close coordination on climate to build upon the fledgling [LOC Copenhagen  ] Accord ; better coordination on G20 and financial supervisory and regulatory reform issues ; our joint commitment to reach a [ORG Doha Development Agenda Agreement  ] ; the need to improve the [ORG Transatlantic Economic Council  ] ( [ORG TEC  ] ) and use it to secure concrete achievements that boost growth and create jobs ; and improving [MISC U.S.-EU  ] crisis response and development cooperation in the wake of the [LOC Haiti  ] earthquake . 
IMPROVING [MISC U.S.-EU  ] COOPERATION TO MEET THE &BASIC8 CHALLENGE --------------------------------------------- -------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG DNSA  ] [PER Froman  ] made two major points to his interlocutors on bilateral relations . 
First , he stressed , 2009 was a transition year for both the [ORG U.S. Administration  ] and [ORG EU  ] institutions , with both facing enormous challenges . 
Despite our mutual good intentions in relaunching [MISC U.S.-EU  ] relations , [PER Froman  ] said , and great improvement in tone , we continued to talk past each other on some issues . 
He cited [LOC Copenhagen  ] as an example , where both sides misread each other , s negotiating bottom lines , and stressed that [ORG EU  ] leaders , &one-upsmanship8 model of outdoing each other to push EU-wide policy did not/not work in dealing with the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Administration.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Second , [PER Froman  ] told the [ORG EU  ] officials , it is remarkable how closely coordinated the &BASIC8 group of countries ( [LOC China  ] , [LOC India  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC South Africa  ] ) have become in international fora , taking turns to impede [MISC U.S./EU  ] initiatives and playing the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] off against each other . 
[ORG BASIC  ] countries have widely differing interests , he said , but have subordinated these to their common short-term goals to block some [MISC Western  ] initiatives . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] need to learn from this coordination , [PER Froman  ] said , and work much more closely and effectively together ourselves , to better handle third country obstructionism and avoid future trainwrecks on climate , [LOC Doha  ] or financial regulatory reform. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Kennard  ] underscored that this is a significant moment for [MISC U.S.-EU  ] relations . 
There is important alignment between our interests , he said , with President [PER Obama  ] as a committed multilateralist in the [LOC White House  ] . 
We must feel urgency to work together to deliver real benefits that will boost growth and create jobs , the Ambassador stressed , given that we have a limited window of opportunity before a political referendum occurs on these efforts. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [ORG EU  ] officials welcomed [PER Froman  ] , s and the Ambassador , s calls for closer cooperation . 
Director General for [ORG External Relations Vale  ] de [PER Almeida  ] emphasized that the [ORG Commission  ] transition and [ORG Lisbon Treaty  ] implementation , while seeming to add to the complexity of [ORG EU  ] institutions ( for example , with greater power for [MISC European  ] Parliament ) will produce a streamlined [ORG EU  ] that is an indispensible [LOC U.S.  ] partner . 
[ORG Commission  ] President [PER Barroso  ] is committed to closer relations , [ORG Vale  ] de [PER Almeida  ] said , highlighting his shift of [ORG TEC  ] leadership to the Trade Commissioner as a positive step . 
[ORG Vale  ] de [PER Almeida  ] asked for [LOC U.S.  ] understanding in the [ORG EU  ] attaching political importance to annual [MISC U.S.-EU  ] Summits and other &processes8 ; these processes are the way the [ORG EU  ] produces results , he declared . 
He acknowledged the [LOC U.S.  ] desire for concrete outcomes but stressed that symbolism is important to [ORG EU  ] institutions . 
[LOC BRUSSELS  ] 00000183 003 OF 007 <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Council President [PER Van Rompuy Chief  ] of Staff [PER Van Daele  ] elaborated on the theme that the [LOC Lisbon  ] changes , in adding a permanent [ORG EU Council  ] President and Foreign Policy High Representative , will strengthen the [ORG EU  ] , s capacity to be an effective [LOC U.S.  ] partner . 
[PER Froman  ] responded that the [LOC U.S.  ] welcomes the [LOC Lisbon  ] changes and wants to help [PER Van Rompuy  ] in his new position . 
[PER Van Daele  ] welcomed this , saying he understood [LOC U.S.  ] policy constraints on climate and financial regulation , given [PER Capitol Hill  ] dynamics . 
We must work together on economic reform and must look forward together , he added ; there is &no good from wagging fingers.8 The [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] must focus more on getting [LOC China  ] more invested in global cooperation , he concluded , to make the [MISC Chinese  ] realize they &can , t have their cake and eat it too.8 <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Member State Permanent Representation Ambassadors appreciated the good will of [PER Froman  ] and the [ORG Administration  ] to work for better relations with [LOC Europe  ] . 
[LOC UK  ] Ambassador [PER Darroch  ] stressed that President [PER Obama  ] , s engagement with [LOC Europe  ] ( the President has made six trips to [LOC Europe  ] since his inauguration , [PER Froman  ] noted ) is welcome , and that [MISC European  ] leaders &haven , t sufficiently responded yet.8 The Ambassadors were skeptical that [LOC Lisbon  ] would bring rapid benefits . 
They noted that [ORG EU  ] institutions will require an adjustment period to the new structure , implying delay in a fully effective [ORG EU  ] under the new treaty . 
[MISC Polish  ] Ambassador [PER Tombinski  ] expected &a big institutional fight , 8 but thought eventually [LOC Lisbon  ] may speed up [ORG EU  ] operations . 
[MISC French  ] Ambassador [PER Etienne  ] said the challenge will be to use these new capabilities effectively so the [ORG EU  ] can act coherently with its major partners . 
Ambassadors [PER Danielsson  ] of [LOC Sweden  ] and [PER Christofferson  ] of [LOC Denmark  ] agreed that the lesson of our mutual misunderstanding in [LOC Copenhagen  ] should be ensuring better communication to avoid a recurrence in other fora . 
CLIMATE CHANGE: BUILDING UPON THE [LOC COPENHAGEN  ] ACCORD --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Climate Commissioner-designate [PER Hedegaard  ] thanked [PER Froman  ] for President [PER Obama  ] , s efforts in [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
She asked about [LOC U.S.  ] legislative efforts on climate and [LOC U.S.  ] political dynamics around mid-term [ORG Congressional  ] elections and how they might impact [LOC U.S.  ] international cooperation moving toward [MISC COP-16  ] in [LOC Cancun  ] , [LOC Mexico  ] . 
[PER Froman  ] responded that the [LOC U.S.  ] , overriding international goal , to work on implementing the [LOC Copenhagen  ] [MISC Accord  ] as well as on the other [ORG UN  ] tracks , will not change . 
We will still work toward domestic legislation as well , [PER Froman  ] said . 
He thought midterm dynamics would not strongly impact our work going into [LOC Cancun.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Froman  ] and [PER Hedegaard  ] reviewed [LOC Copenhagen  ] outcomes . 
[PER Froman  ] said that while nobody considered the agreement complete , it is a good step forward . 
[PER Hedegaard  ] said [LOC Copenhagen  ] left some disappointed in the [ORG UN  ] process , but stressed that we can , t give up . 
The [MISC Accord  ] contains a lot of good points , she said , that should not be wasted . 
She hoped that the [LOC U.S.  ] noted the [ORG EU  ] was muting its criticism of the [LOC U.S.  ] , to be constructive. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Both officials agreed we must focus now on operational steps to implement the [LOC Copenhagen  ] [MISC Accord  ] . 
[PER Froman  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] will work in the next few weeks on getting countries to sign up for ( &associate themselves with8 ) the [MISC Accord  ] , and to inscribe their targets . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] would be happy , he suggested , with the seven emerging market countries in the [MISC Major Economies Forum  ] ( [ORG MEF  ] ) , saying others would then follow . 
We also need to work on financing , he added. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Froman  ] emphasized that we need to determine the right process and grouping of countries to go forward . 
This could be the [LOC Greenland  ] group of 28 countries from [LOC Copenhagen  ] , [ORG MEF  ] members , or countries signing the [MISC Accord  ] , he speculated . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] is not wedded to a particular grouping , he said , but there seems to be broad consensus that relying on the two [ORG UNFCCC  ] working groups is insufficient . 
[PER Hedegaard  ] agreed , suggesting that an informal [ORG MEF  ] grouping might be effective . 
It would be critical that this have legitimacy , she said . 
[LOC BRUSSELS  ] 00000183 004 OF 007 The [LOC Greenland  ] group is an option , she said , but others might resent this designation. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) It is vital to get [MISC G-77  ] agreement to whatever grouping we use , [PER Hedegaard  ] continued . 
Both agreed it will be important to talk to incoming [MISC G-77  ] chair [LOC Yemen  ] , with [PER Froman  ] adding it will also be important to be in close touch with [LOC Mexico  ] as [MISC COP-16  ] chair . 
In fact , [PER Froman  ] added , we need all major groups ) the [ORG EU  ] , [ORG MEF  ] , [ORG BASIC  ] , [MISC G-77  ] , the island countries ) to agree to a negotiating mechanism . 
[PER Hedegaard  ] responded that we will need to work around unhelpful countries such as [LOC Venezuela  ] or [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
[PER Froman  ] agreed that we will need to neutralize , co-opt or marginalize these and others such as [LOC Nicaragua  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] , [LOC Ecuador  ] . 
[PER Hedegaard  ] noted the irony that the [ORG EU  ] is a big donor to these countries , while [LOC Cuba  ] , for example , is actively discouraging others from signing on to the [ORG Accord.  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Both agreed that we need processes for coordination and avoiding recriminations . 
[PER Hedegaard  ] said the [ORG EU  ] will use the February 11 informal [ORG European Council  ] meeting to reflect on how to be more focused and effective on climate . 
[PER Froman  ] noted he will do likewise for the [LOC U.S.  ] in meetings with Climate Special [PER Envoy Todd Stern  ] and other [ORG Administration  ] officials . 
He suggested that he and [PER Hedegaard  ] speak before the Council meeting to coordinate ; she agreed to a videoconference February 10 , the day after the new [ORG Commission  ] is expected to be formally approved by the [ORG European Parliament.  ] <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER Froman  ] and [PER Hedegaard  ] then discussed specific goals for the [LOC Bonn  ] and [LOC Cancun  ] meetings . 
[PER Hedegaard  ] said we must have universal acknowledgment that &the world cannot afford8 failure to reach a binding agreement . 
[PER Froman  ] thought that we should try for progress by [LOC Cancun  ] on MRV ( monitoring , reporting and verification ) , the adaptation framework , technologies , and some resolution of process . 
Both agreed that we should also get countries to inscribe 2020 targets. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [PER Froman  ] and [PER Hedegaard  ] also discussed their respective domestic policy developments , noting the complex issue of carbon border taxes . 
This is an issue of great concern to [LOC China  ] , [PER Froman  ] noted . 
[PER Hedegaard  ] noted the [ORG EU  ] , s struggle with how to manage inclusion of aviation and maritime sectors in the [ORG EU  ] , s [ORG Emissions Trading Scheme  ] . 
Both agreed it is vital to show economic benefits and potential job creation from bilateral cooperation on climate and clean energy technologies , to build public support for our efforts ; [PER Hedegaard  ] committed to provide to [PER Froman  ] [ORG EU  ] studies showing such impacts. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) [PER Froman  ] summarized his climate points for the Member State Ambassadors ; while some [MISC Post-Copenhagen  ] soul searching is warranted , he said , we need to focus on avoiding a damaging replay of our division there in the runup to [LOC Cancun  ] . 
We need to work to make the [LOC Copenhagen  ] [MISC Accord  ] real , getting all countries that matter to associate themselves with the agreement and inscribing their targets . 
We need early [MISC U.S.-EU  ] agreement on the right group and process to take discussions forward , and need progress on financing , technical points and transparency and verification ; all are important , he concluded . 
G20/REFORM OF [ORG FINANCIAL SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) [PER Froman  ] heard at length from [ORG Internal Markets  ] Commissioner-designate [PER Barnier  ] and several lunch participants on the importance of coordination in the [ORG G20  ] and elsewhere on reform of financial supervision and regulation . 
[PER Froman  ] stressed with all that the [LOC U.S.  ] wants to work closely with the [ORG EU  ] on all [ORG G20  ] issues , particularly on agreeing to common principles . 
The [ORG G20  ] is an important framework for this cooperation , he said , and it is vital that we deliver results on [ORG G20  ] commitments not just for their own sake but to build the credibility of the [ORG G20  ] framework . 
[PER Froman  ] said he wants to ensure the [ORG G20  ] is effective . 
[LOC BRUSSELS  ] 00000183 005 OF 007 <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) Director General for Economic and Financial Affairs [PER Buti  ] agreed that the ascendency of the [ORG G20  ] has raised our need for bilateral coordination . 
He lauded the new macroeconomic and financial dialogue with [ORG Treasury  ] launched just days ago , noting we have agreed to hold this to coordinate views before major events . 
[PER Buti  ] said 2009 was a &fantastic year8 for the [ORG G20  ] , and noted we are delivering on many of the major commitments , including [ORG IFI  ] reform , resources and quotas , the framework for balanced growth agreed in [LOC Pittsburgh  ] , and sharing plans for withdrawal of stimulus when appropriate . 
[PER Froman  ] responded that a major medium-term challenge should then be more structural reform ; [PER Buti  ] agreed . 
[ORG Vale de Almeida  ] said the [ORG G20  ] is improving and streamlining as it develops , which is positive . 
He pointed to [PER Buti  ] and others at the lunch as those who can deliver on [ORG EU  ] commitments and cooperation in the [LOC G20.  ] <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) [PER Barnier  ] told [PER Froman  ] he wants to work closely and in confidence with the [LOC U.S.  ] He wants to move as much as possible in step with the [LOC U.S.  ] , he stressed . 
[PER Barnier  ] , s first non-EU trip will be to the [LOC U.S.  ] , he added , possibly for the April G20/IMF Spring Meetings . 
[PER Froman  ] responded that [ORG Treasury  ] had the primary role on financial services issues , but that he looked forward to staying in touch . 
Before President [PER Obama  ] , s recent announcements on banking reform , [PER Barnier  ] noted , there had been doubts in the [ORG EU  ] on [LOC U.S.  ] willingness to fulfill [ORG G20  ] commitments . 
There have been doubts about [LOC U.S.  ] willingness to implement [MISC Basel II  ] bank capital rules , but said this is important to ensure a level playing field . 
[PER Froman  ] again emphasized [LOC U.S.  ] willingness to work with [LOC Europe  ] on these issues. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) [PER Barnier  ] said he was impressed by President [PER Obama  ] , s announcements on bank size and scope . 
He noted [ORG EU  ] reaction has varied , with the [LOC UK  ] against , the [MISC Dutch  ] in favor and the [MISC French  ] &supportive of the direction.8 [PER David Wright  ] , Director for [ORG DG Internal Market  ] , said the announcements were a significant and structural change from what had been under discussion in the international community . 
He emphasized that the [ORG EU  ] normally does not regulate via caps on particular business lines but through competition policy . 
[ORG Vale de Almeida  ] in the lunch also questioned whether the announcements were &off-mark8 from the [ORG G20  ] . 
[PER Froman  ] responded that these proposals were consistent with what had been raised previously , noted that we were not alone in showing leadership on these issues , but returned to the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to cooperate toward agreement on basic principles and avoid damaging regulatory arbitrage. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C ) [PER Barnier  ] said &his roadmap is the [ORG G20  ] roadmap , 8 and he seeks relevant , proportionate regulation in [LOC Europe  ] that leaves no market or player unregulated . 
He said his immediate priorities include resolving Council-Parliament differences over [ORG EU  ] financial supervisory architecture , OTC derivatives ( and cooperation here with the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) , corporate governance , and improving crisis prevention and management tools . 
WORKING TOWARD A [ORG DOHA DEAL  ] -------------------------- <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( C ) [PER Froman  ] emphasized to Commissioner [PER De Gucht  ] and other [ORG EU  ] officials the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to try to complete an ambitious [ORG Doha Development Agenda  ] agreement , but said that public spats over negotiations were damaging ; we should work to prevent this going forward . 
[PER Froman  ] described our [LOC Doha  ] position , and our bilateral engagement with [LOC India  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC China  ] and others to produce market access . 
He emphasized the vital importance of this market access to our stakeholders and the [ORG Congress  ] . 
[PER Froman  ] said that the current offer is not acceptable to [LOC U.S.  ] agriculture , [ORG NAMA  ] or services stakeholders . 
[PER De Gucht  ] responded that it is important to close the [ORG Doha Round  ] , and that blaming others does not get us there ; the question is how to manage the process with appropriate ambition . 
He said that the [ORG EU  ] can live with the result on the table , but if other things come onto the table , we will need a &new equilibrium.8 [PER De Gucht  ] said he hoped that the [LOC U.S.  ] bilateral efforts would not interfere with the ability to nail down existing tariffs ( Comment: this probably [LOC BRUSSELS  ] 00000183 006 OF 007 refers to proposed bound tariff reductions in recent [ORG DDA  ] texts , which reduce maximum permitted ) bound ) tariffs but do not reduce currently applied tariffs significantly . 
End comment ) . <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( C ) [PER De Gucht  ] added that he faces a similar challenge , because the [MISC Spanish  ] Presidency is pushing for bilateral [MISC FTAs  ] with [LOC Latin America  ] , and he wants to ensure such efforts do not interfere with the [ORG DDA  ] . 
[PER Froman  ] responded that eliminating &water8 between bound and actual tariffs is insufficient , that there has to be additional market access . 
[PER Froman  ] emphasized the importance of the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] sending a consistent message on this issue to third countries , even though he recognized that our positions , though similar , are not identical . 
He encouraged open dialogue and transparency with the [ORG EU  ] . 
[PER Froman  ] said he did not want there to be misunderstanding among our trading partners ( similar to what happened in [LOC Copenhagen  ] ) that the [LOC U.S.  ] would ultimately agree to what is on the table . 
MAKING THE TRANSATLANTIC ECONOMIC COUNCIL DELIVER --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( C ) [PER Froman  ] emphasized to all of his interlocutors the Administration , s interest in making the [ORG TEC  ] deliver real results . 
We are open to all ideas , he said ; we can reform , restructure or even eliminate the [ORG TEC  ] , based on what we identify together as the best way to secure concrete achievements . 
The Ambassador added that the bottom line should be generating growth and creating jobs , which could help us prioritize issues for the [ORG TEC  ] agenda. <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
( C ) [PER De Gucht  ] welcomed [PER Froman  ] , s interest in the [ORG TEC  ] . 
He viewed the [ORG TEC  ] as very important , particularly in the context of the rising [MISC Chinese  ] economy and significant trade deficits of both the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] with [LOC China  ] . 
[PER De Gucht  ] noted that as [MISC U.S.-EU  ] tariffs have fallen , non-tariff barriers ( NTBs ) are the logical next challenge . 
[PER De Gucht Chief  ] of [PER Staff VanHeukelen  ] stressed that [MISC U.S.-EU  ] economic links are &hard to overestimate , 8 with &colossal8 bilateral FDI . 
[PER De Gucht  ] highlighted a recent study showing that if we could remove one half of existing bilateral NTBs , the [ORG EU  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] would get many billions of dollars in welfare gains ( GDP increases ) by 2016 , or greater than [LOC Doha  ] . 
Seatter of [ORG DG External Relations  ] pointed to the 12-14 million jobs dependent on transatlantic trade , stressing that steps to expand these jobs could be an important near-term [ORG TEC  ] achievement . 
[PER VanHeukelen  ] said that to date the [ORG TEC  ] has not been seen as extremely effective , but it is important that it do better. <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
( C ) Both the [ORG EU  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] need more growth , [PER De Gucht  ] said , in the face of such challenges as rising social security and health care costs . 
[PER De Gucht  ] recognized , however , that there are political problems with addressing some NTBs . 
He agreed it is important that the next [ORG TEC  ] meeting produces concrete results , and should not be a simple get-acquainted session . 
Therefore , he added , we must prepare carefully , out of the spotlight . 
He said [LOC Spain  ] is pushing for a [ORG TEC  ] before its Presidency ends June 30 , but noted it is unclear if this would provide adequate preparation time . 
He said a low-profile planning meeting might be more appropriate in the near term . 
He added he is preparing a paper on [ORG TEC  ] goals to send to the [LOC U.S.  ] in the next few weeks and hoped the [LOC U.S.  ] could do the same . 
[PER De Gucht  ] said he hopes to visit [LOC Washington  ] in late February to discuss key [ORG TEC  ] and trade issues with [PER Froman  ] and others . 
( Note: his staff clarified that the trip will likely be in early March . 
End note ) . <a id='par31' href='#par31'>¶</a>31 . 
( C ) Both agreed that possible [ORG TEC  ] topics could include [LOC Doha  ] , climate , China/third country issues , and financial regulation .
