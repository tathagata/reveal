( [ORG SBU  ] ) A delegation from the [LOC United States International Religious Freedom Commission  ] ( [ORG USCIRF  ] ) , consisting of three commissioners and three staff members led by the [ORG USCIRF  ] chairman , visited [LOC Cairo  ] from January 22 to 26 . 
The delegation met with the Minister of [LOC Islamic Endowments  ] , the [PER Grand Imam  ] of [ORG Al Azhar  ] [PER Mohamed Sayed Tantawi  ] , a [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] human rights official , the quasi-governmental [ORG National Council for Human Rights  ] , human rights activists , and representatives of minority religious communities , [MISC Muslim  ] and non-Muslim . 
The delegation , at the request of the [ORG GoE  ] , agreed to defer travel to [LOC Upper Egypt  ] because of ongoing tensions following the [MISC Naga Hamadi  ] sectarian attack ( refs A and B . 
) Although the delegation made no public statements , it attracted intense press attention , mostly critical of the [ORG USCIRF  ] 's " interference " in [LOC Egypt  ] 's " internal affairs . 
" Minister of [LOC Islamic Endowments  ] and [ORG NCHR  ] on [PER Naga Hamadi  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Discussions with [PER Hamdi Zaqzouq  ] , Minister of [LOC Islamic Endowments  ] ( [LOC Awqaf  ] ) , focused on the January 6 killings in [PER Naga Hamadi  ] ( refs A and B ) . 
According to [PER Zaqzouq  ] , the killings were a response to the November rape of a [MISC Muslim  ] girl by a [MISC Coptic  ] man . 
[PER Zaqzouq  ] asserted that such " honor crimes " occur regularly and only receive [MISC Western  ] media attention when both [MISC Christians  ] and [MISC Muslims  ] are involved . 
[PER Zaqzouq  ] said that " all [MISC Muslim  ] leaders " criticized the " criminal act " and recounted how he travelled to [MISC Naga Hamadi  ] after the attack to offer condolences to the victims' families. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Kamal Aboul Magd  ] , Vice President of the quasi-governmental [ORG National Council for Human Rights  ] ( [ORG NCHR  ] ) , told the delegation that it had dispatched a team of researchers to [MISC Naga Hamadi  ] to investigate . 
[PER Aboul Magd  ] said the [ORG NCHR  ] 's researchers had completed a report which it had delivered to the [ORG GoE  ] , but had not released publicly . 
Without revealing the report 's contents , [PER Aboul Magd  ] said the [ORG NCHR  ] 's finding would make it difficult for the [ORG GoE  ] to avoid " fully applying " the law in the [MISC Naga Hamadi  ] case . 
MFA on [MISC Naga Hamadi  ] and [MISC Defamation  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Deputy Assistant Foreign Minister for [ORG Human Rights Wael Aboul  ] [PER Magd  ] told the delegation that " societal violence " between [MISC Muslims  ] and [MISC Copts  ] is a regular occurrence , but [PER Naga Hamadi  ] had forced [MISC Egyptian  ] society to focus on the problem . 
As a result of national " outrage , " [PER Aboul Magd  ] believes the law will be firmly applied . 
[PER Aboul Magd  ] said he remains unsure about the motives for the killings , acknowledging that the [ORG GoE  ] 's initial assertion that the killing was in revenge for the alleged rape of a [MISC Muslim  ] girl in November " doesn't seem to fit . 
" He urged caution , however , in accepting " broader conspiracy theories " tying the crime to a political rivalry between [PER Naga Hamadi  ] 's [MISC Coptic  ] bishop and a local politician . 
Commenting more generally on sectarianism , [PER Aboul Magd  ] said that [MISC Muslim-Christian  ] relations have traditionally been " reasonably good , " but in recent years [MISC Egyptian  ] society has become " worryingly radicalized " with each group taking on an " us verses them " mentality . 
He said the [ORG GoE  ] is concerned about this trend and is working to overcome it through its focus on [MISC Egyptian  ] citizenship - not religious affiliation - as the source of rights and duties. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Addressing [LOC Egypt  ] 's sponsorship of the defamation of religions resolution in the [ORG United Nations  ] , [PER Aboul Magd  ] said [LOC Egypt  ] will continue to push the resolution . 
According to [PER Aboul Magd  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] 's goal is to protect [LOC Europe  ] 's [MISC Muslim  ] community and encourage [MISC European  ] countries to treat " incitement of religious hatred " as a crime . 
[LOC CAIRO  ] 00000153 002 OF 003 Church Leader on [ORG Security Services  ] Harassment <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) At the [LOC Qasr  ] al [ORG Dubara Presbyterian Church  ] , which works with [MISC Muslim  ] converts to [MISC Christianity  ] , Pastor [PER Sameh Mories  ] told the delegation that the situation of [MISC Muslim  ] converts to [MISC Christianity  ] is deteriorating . 
Although [PER Mories  ] believes President [PER Mubarak  ] and the upper-levels of the [ORG GoE  ] are " very supportive " of religious freedom ( he noted that [PER Mubarak  ] approved more building permits for churches than " [PER Sadat  ] , [PER Nasser  ] and the kings combined " ) , he thinks [LOC Egypt  ] 's security services are becoming increasingly powerful and hostile to [MISC Muslim  ] converts to [MISC Christianity  ] . 
[PER Mories  ] lamented that " five years ago , converts to [MISC Christianity  ] were persecuted by their families ; now the police are turning converts over to their families . 
" [PER Mories  ] said that as a church that baptizes [MISC Muslims  ] , [LOC Qasr  ] al [PER Dubara  ] is under constant police scrutiny , and he complained that three [LOC U.S.  ] religious leaders who have had contact with the church had recently been denied entry into [LOC Egypt  ] by the [ORG GoE.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) At the [LOC Qasr  ] al [ORG Dubara Church  ] , the delegation met with [MISC Muslim  ] convert to [MISC Christianity  ] [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , who unsuccessfully sued the [ORG GoE  ] to compel it to recognize his conversion ( refs C and D ) . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , accompanied by [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , complained of harassment and threats from his family and society arising from his conversion . 
A [ORG USCIRF  ] delegation member told poloff that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] pulled him aside after the meeting to request unspecified [ORG U.S. Government  ] assistance . 
[ORG Baha'is  ] , [ORG Jehovah Witnesses  ] and [MISC Quranists  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The delegation met with representatives of [LOC Egypt  ] 's [ORG Baha'i  ] , [ORG Jehovah Witnesses  ] and [MISC Quranists  ] . 
[MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG Baha'i  ] leadership said that while the [ORG GoE  ] continues to issue identification documents to unmarried [ORG Baha'is  ] ( " over 120 " birth certificates and " 30 to 40 " national identification cards ) in compliance with a judicial decision ( ref E ) , the [ORG GoE  ] has not issued documents to any married [ORG Baha'is  ] as the [ORG GoE  ] does not recognize [ORG Baha'i  ] marriage . 
[ORG Jehovah Witness  ] leadership complained of a December 2009 Administrative Court decision refusing to allow the [ORG Jehovah Witness  ] community to register as a legal entity . 
[ORG Jehovah Witness  ] leadership said the judge based his decision largely on [ORG Coptic Orthodox  ] [PER Pope Shenouda  ] 's 2005 statement that the [ORG Jehovah Witnesses  ] are not [MISC Christians  ] . 
The [ORG Jehovah Witnesses  ] also complained of ongoing security service surveillance and threats . 
Quranist ( a small heterodox [MISC Islamic  ] group ( ref F ) ) community members complained of on-going [ORG GoE  ] harassment - including travel bans - and societal hostility , especially from the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] . 
Sheikh [PER Tantawi  ] on [PER Naga Hamadi  ] , [ORG Baha'is  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Sheikh [PER Tantawi  ] , the head of [ORG Al Azhar  ] , met twice with the delegation . 
He condemned the [PER Naga Hamadi  ] attack which he attributed to " extremist " thinking . 
[PER Tantawi  ] said that in [ORG Al Azhar  ] 's view , there is no distinction between [MISC Muslims  ] and [MISC Christians  ] ; all are [MISC Egyptians  ] with the same rights and responsibilities . 
On [ORG Baha'is  ] , [PER Tantawi  ] argued that there is a distinction , and defended labeling [ORG Baha'is  ] " apostates " if they had left [MISC Islam  ] . 
[PER Tantwai  ] said , however , that " apostasy " should be used only as a legal term and acknowledged the danger that " extremists " could receive the wrong message from the word . 
[ORG Coptic Orthodox Church Declines  ] to Meet with Delegation <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Pope Shenouda  ] , the leader of the [ORG Coptic Orthodox Church  ] , declined to meet with the delegation . 
In public statements , [PER Shenouda  ] attributed his refusal to the Church 's " rejection of foreign interference in [LOC Egypt  ] 's internal affairs . 
" Separately , a [ORG Coptic Church  ] official told poloff and the delegation that the [LOC CAIRO  ] 00000153 003 OF 003 church was under " intense pressure from security services " not to meet with the [ORG USCIRF  ] . 
The official also said that the Church feared it would be blamed by the [ORG GoE  ] if it met with the delegation and the [ORG USCIRF  ] subsequently downgraded [LOC Egypt  ] in its annual report from a " watch list " country to a " country of particular concern . 
" Intense Press Interest <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The visit generated intense press coverage , much of it focused on the timing in the aftermath of the [PER Naga Hamadi  ] attack and highlighting [PER Pope Shenouda  ] 's refusal to meet the delegation . 
Both pro-government and opposition party press accused the [ORG USCIRF  ] of " interference in [MISC Egyptian  ] internal affairs " and called the timing of the visit " suspicious . 
" Commentaries in the pro-government press were generally negative with references to the " evil committee " visiting [LOC Egypt  ] to prepare " charges of sectarianism . 
" Some independent commentators were more nuanced ; analysts in independent newspapers wrote that " the usual [MISC Egyptian  ] response of none of your business is a primitive attitude , " and if religious freedom " is an internal affair , then we must start immediately by reforming our internal affairs . 
" <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) The [ORG USCIRF  ] delegation did not clear this message .
