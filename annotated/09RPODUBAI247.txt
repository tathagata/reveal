REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) In reftel , we suggested the two most likely outcomes for the [MISC Iranian  ] election were a [PER Moussavi  ] win in the first round , or a massively fraudulent [PER Ahmadinejad  ] win in the first round . 
( Winning in the first round requites winning more than 50 percent of the nationwide vote . 
) It appears both took place . 
[PER Moussavi  ] in a press conference on 06/13 claimed [ORG Interior Ministry  ] told him and his campaign Friday night that he had won . 
It then appears that massive political intervention led to a huge ( 60 percent plus ) [ORG AN  ] landslide being announced on state TV early on [MISC Saturday.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Based upon statements by [PER Moussavi  ] and [PER Karroubi  ] , comments from sources inside [LOC Iran  ] , and press reports , we can expect some form of public rejection by their campaigns and their supporters of the reelection of President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] . 
Former IRGC Commander [PER Mohsen Rezai  ] has not yet spoken on the results . 
In his statements [PER Moussavi  ] called the result " treason " and vowed to fight . 
[PER Karroubi  ] issued a statement at 1500 [LOC Tehran  ] time on 06/13 calling the process unconstitutional and stating that he would not remain quiet as he did in 2005. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Official results of [ORG AN  ] 's victory with 63 percent of the vote were announced at 1630 [LOC Tehran  ] time Saturday . 
Even before the results were public , large protests have reportedly broken out in [LOC Tehran  ] as of 1530 . 
We anticipate these will continue , possibly leading to skirmishes between [PER Moussavi  ] supporters and [ORG AN  ] forces this evening . 
Reports indicate a heavy security presence in the [LOC Tehran  ] streets , so the situation could escalate quickly. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: We surmise that the Supreme Leader 's control over the security services and national media will act to inhibit the flow of reliable information coming out of [LOC Iran  ] in the coming days . 
As reported earlier , however , over 200 foreign media were in [LOC Iran  ] to cover the election , so they may serve as an eyewitness to developments . 
The outcome of this contested election could be as limited as a large segment of the population feeling intensely alienated and angry . 
This is nothing new for the [LOC IRIG  ] , and their monopoly of force and some well-timed repression can likely quell most dissent - although it would be particularly bad [LOC PR  ] to do this while so many foreign media are present. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment , Cont 'd .: It is possible , however , that given the number of senior political figures this campaign and this election result have profoundly angered , and the scope of popular resentment over the results ; a large-scale political crisis could develop . 
Our position should remain wait-and-see for the time being , particularly as several key figures have yet to speak publicly on events . 
That said , if the opposition does start to organize on a large scale , or if clashes turn violent , we will need to quickly determine an appropriate public position . 
Many opposition supporters will likely look to the [LOC US  ] - particularly after the [LOC Cairo  ] speech - for inspiration .
