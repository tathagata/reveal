REASO N: 1.4 ( C ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) This message is a response to reftel request for information on [MISC Dutch  ] Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] 's Weblog by [ORG Washington Analysts  ] and the [ORG Open Source Center  ] ( [ORG OSC  ] ) . <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC Dutch  ] Prime Minister [PER Jan Peter Balkenende  ] maintained a weblog ( blog ) -- www.janpeterbalkenende.nl -- during the recent [MISC Dutch  ] Parliamentary election campaign . 
The first entry is dated October 2 , 2006 , and the last is dated November 23 , 2006 , i.e. the day after the elections . 
There have been no subsequent entries , and post is not aware of any plans to revive the blog at this time. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Balkenende  ] was one of several party leaders who set up blogs during the election in an effort to reach out to new potential voters , especially among youth . 
Some senior [MISC Dutch  ] government officials , including outgoing Finance Minister [PER Zalm  ] and outgoing Defense Minister [LOC Kamp  ] , and about a dozen members of Parliament , also maintain regular weblogs between elections and use them to comment on current affairs . 
[PER Balkenende  ] has not done so. however. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Most of the entries in [PER Balkenende  ] 's blog were short , peppy , and focused on familiar [ORG CDA  ] campaign themes . 
While post does not know for certain who drafted the entries , the language and subject matter was consistent with [PER Balkenende  ] 's personal style , and we have no reason to believe that he did not write them himself . 
Reactions were posted on the blog and appear to have been only minimally filtered , if at all . 
Most reactions were positive and many offered " " advice " " on campaign strategy and how [PER Balkenende  ] should approach coalition formation talks. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Balkenende  ] 's entries made little mention of his home life , which is not unusual for politicians in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
His relative openness in writing about his own experiences on the campaign trail , however , were seen as " " humanizing " " him and probably added to his popularity . 
[MISC Dutch  ] media reported early in the campaign on the establishment of [PER Balkenende  ] 's blog -- along with those of his political rivals -- but the blog itself does not appear to have been a major source of reportable material during the campaign .
