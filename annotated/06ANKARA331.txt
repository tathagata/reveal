( S ) SUMMARY: Your visit to [LOC Turkey  ] comes at an important time . 
The tone of the relationship has been improving since PM [PER Erdogan  ] , s visit to [LOC Washington  ] last June , but [LOC Iraq  ] continues to dominate our agenda , including [LOC Turkey  ] , s concerns regarding the [ORG PKK  ] , the [MISC Iraqi  ] [MISC Kurds  ] , independence aspirations , and the fortunes of [LOC Ankara  ] , s perceived constituents , the [MISC Iraqi  ] [MISC Turkmen  ] . 
While the Nov. 9-10 High [ORG Level Defense Group  ] ( [ORG HLDG  ] ) meetings in [LOC Ankara  ] ) the first in two years ) helped move our defense dialogue away from “all [LOC Iraq  ] all the time , 8 the issues have not gone away . 
You will want to acknowledge [LOC Turkey  ] , s contribution to the war in [LOC Iraq  ] and the overall [ORG Global War on Terrorism  ] ( GWOT ) : the logistics hub at [LOC Incirlik  ] , the [ORG Habur Gate GLOC  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] , s military and reconstruction contributions to [LOC Afghanistan  ] and engendering regional cooperation in the [LOC Black Sea  ] . 
It will be important to respond to complaints about [LOC US  ] inaction against the [ORG PKK  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] by pointing to what we are doing to help [LOC Turkey  ] to combat the [ORG PKK  ] elsewhere and in other areas of the GWOT . 
Your visit also provides an opportunity to foster an atmosphere of increased engagement and cooperation in the near future . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) We aren’t out of the woods yet , but our bilateral relationship is on the upswing from the trough that deepened in fall 2004 with [MISC MNF-I  ] operations in [LOC Tal Afar  ] and [LOC Fallujah  ] , repeated [MISC Turkish  ] truck driver abductions and killings , and factually incorrect and biased [MISC Turkish  ] press coverage which [MISC Turkish  ] officials failed to refute and in some cases abetted . 
Despite the continued unpopularity of the war in [LOC Iraq  ] ( over 95% of the population opposes the war ) this no longer dominates the news . 
Then [ORG DCHOD  ] [PER GEN Basbug  ] took the first step toward improving relations in a January 26 , 2005 nationally-televised press conference , in which he underscored the importance of the bilateral relationship . 
Following [LOC US  ] and [MISC Turkish  ] media stories in February 2005 about deteriorating bilateral relations , [ORG NSC Sec  ] Gen [ORG Alpogan  ] , [ORG FM Gul  ] and others scrambled to match [MISC GEN Basbug’s  ] words . 
In an April speech to the [MISC Istanbul War Academy  ] , [ORG CHOD  ] GEN Ozkok called the bilateral relationship &too broad and important to be defined by one issue . 
8 With the visits of PM [PER Erdogan  ] , [ORG FM Gul  ] and [ORG DCHOD  ] Basbug to [LOC Washington  ] in early June , the Sept. 8-9 visit of [ORG GEN Jones  ] and then-CENTCOM Deputy Commander [PER LTG Smith  ] , the Sept. 24 visit to [LOC Ankara  ] of [LOC APNSA Hadley  ] , the December visits to [LOC Ankara  ] of [ORG FBI  ] Chief [PER Mueller  ] and [ORG CIA  ] Director [ORG Goss  ] , and most recently the Jan. 17 visit of [ORG EUCOM  ] Deputy Commander [PER GEN Wald  ] , both sides have demonstrated our commitment to rebuild our historically strong ties through concrete actions and by improving the tone of our public statements . 
[ORG PKK  ] -- GETTING CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE ----------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) TGS Deputy Chief GEN Kosaner did not raise the [ORG PKK  ] with [ORG EUCOM  ] DCDR [PER GEN Wald  ] on January 17 and may not with you . 
However , the [ORG PKK  ] was one of the themes of TLFC Commander [PER GEN Buyukanit’s  ] counterpart visit to the [LOC US  ] in December , and he may raise the terrorist group’s presence in Northern [LOC Iraq  ] with you . 
Your response should point to what we have done and what we have offered to do to address the [ORG PKK  ] problem more widely . 
During the September visit of [ORG Generals Jones  ] and [PER Smith  ] , [ORG TGS  ] rejected EUCOM’s offer of aerial surveillance inside [LOC Turkey  ] , but welcomed CENTCOM’s offer to continue aerial overflights of [ORG PKK  ] camps on the [MISC Iraqi  ] side of border ; [ORG CF  ] now carry out flights every two weeks . 
[LOC Turkey  ] accepted EUCOM’s offer of [ORG Information Operations  ] ( [ORG IO  ] ) support ; [ORG EUCOM  ] staff is developing an interagency proposal that will assist TGS/MFA in developing a more effective [ORG IO  ] program . 
[ORG TGS  ] also welcomed an enhanced intelligence-sharing program on an intermittent basis tied to specific [MISC Turkish  ] operations . 
Indications are the intelligence provided was beneficial to GOT . 
CENTCOM offered to expand the list of [ORG PKK  ] HVI on the [MISC CENTRIX  ] system and to facilitate [MISC TU/IZ  ] mil-mil contacts , which may include joint border patrols . 
These offers remain under discussion , but will likely not bear fruit in the short term. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The interagency initiative to partner with [LOC Turkey  ] and the [MISC Europeans  ] to pursue law enforcement cases against the [ORG PKK  ] is continuing . 
A CIA/DIA/FBI/DOJ/Treasury team visited [LOC Ankara  ] in December ; they and the [LOC Turks  ] identified two [ORG PKK  ] operatives in [LOC Europe  ] to pursue together . 
Your interlocutors may complain about the absence of kinetic action against the [ORG PKK  ] , but we have a good story to tell and we should tell it. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) Despite our efforts , with [ORG PKK  ] attacks continuing to cause casualties among [MISC Turkish  ] military personnel , the [MISC Turkish  ] public and the political class continue to clamor for [LOC US  ] military action in [LOC Iraq  ] against the [ORG PKK  ] , or for a [MISC Turkish  ] cross-border operation . 
There is widespread public belief that lack of [LOC US  ] action against the [ORG PKK  ] is “punishment” for Turkey’s March 2003 failure to give permission for [LOC US  ] forces to transit [LOC Turkey  ] en route to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[ORG SPECIAL FORCES  ] RE-ENGAGEMENT ---------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) One of the casualties of the [LOC Iraq  ] war was the relationship between our [ORG Special Forces  ] ( [ORG SF  ] ) . 
The July 4 , 2003 [MISC Suleymaniyah  ] incident in which [LOC US  ] forces hooded and handcuffed [MISC Turkish  ] [ORG SF  ] officers remains a wound in Turkey’s military and national pride and with the [MISC Turkish  ] public that will possibly take a generation to fully heal . 
We welcomed the Joint Staff invitation to [MISC Turkish  ] Special Forces for a [LOC Washington  ] Sept. 19-27 visit to begin to restore that once close relationship , and we continue to support a SOCEUR-initiated [ORG SF  ] JCET originally scheduled for March 2006 , though budgetary constraints may force a postponement . 
Additionally , [MISC Turkish  ] Land Forces Commander GEN [PER Yasar Buyukanit  ] has just returned from the first [MISC Counterpart Visit  ] ( CPV ) with the [LOC U.S.  ] Army Chief of Staff in nine years . 
GEN [PER Buyukanit  ] was accorded full military honors and had a substantive program as well . 
We believe that visit will contribute greatly to restoring post-OIF army to army relations . 
BEHIND THE SCENES INVOLVEMENT IN [LOC IRAQ  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Despite the unpopularity of the [LOC Iraq  ] war , [LOC Turkey  ] has provided significant logistical support to both Operation [MISC Iraqi  ] Freedom and to [ORG OEF  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[LOC Turkey  ] has approved multiple requests for the use of [LOC Incirlik Air Base  ] , including: a tanker refueling operation which has delivered over 28 million gallons since operations began in 2003 and flown over 2,600 sorties ; the transit of 8,500 [LOC US  ] troops on rotation from [LOC Iraq  ] from January through April 2004 ; and the establishment in May 2005 of a logistics hub which allows 6 [LOC US  ] military [MISC C-17  ] aircraft to move the amount of cargo it took 9-10 military aircraft to move from [LOC Germany  ] . 
This hub has facilitated the movement of 41,339 tons of supplies since its inception ; flown 1280 [MISC C-17  ] sorties ; received 577 wide-bodies cargo aircraft ; and houses 150 TDY support personnel . 
[LOC Turkey  ] also approved the use of hub flights for the emergency evacuation of [LOC US  ] soldiers from [LOC Iraq.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC Habur Gate  ] , the only border crossing from [LOC Turkey  ] into [LOC Iraq  ] , provides 25% of fuel shipments to [ORG Coalition  ] forces in [LOC Iraq  ] and two-thirds of gasoline and diesel fuel shipments for the [MISC Iraqi  ] people . 
Significant shipments of food and water for coalition forces also pass over the border. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Turkish  ] government has also demonstrated its support through its public announcements of support for the recent elections ; its plans to re-open its consulate in [LOC Mosul  ] in early 2006 ; provision of training in [LOC Turkey  ] for [MISC Iraqi  ] diplomats , political parties , and ( as part of the [ORG NATO  ] training mission ) [ORG Iraqi Security Forces  ] ; hosting a conference for [MISC Iraqi  ] constitution drafters in July , and a meeting of [MISC Iraqi Sunni  ] leaders with Ambassador [PER Khalilzad  ] in [LOC Istanbul  ] in [LOC December.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [LOC Turkey  ] currently maintains approximately 1300 of its own forces in Northern [LOC Iraq  ] in camps established prior to [ORG OEF  ] . 
These forces contain elements of armor , mechanized infantry , commando , and [ORG Special Forces  ] units commanded by the [ORG Turkish Special Forces Brigade HQ  ] located in [LOC Silopi  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] . 
This [ORG HQ  ] also provides [MISC Turkish  ] LNO teams to [ORG Coalition  ] HQs in [LOC Kirkuk  ] , [LOC Mosul  ] , and [PER Tal Afar  ] while hosting a [LOC US  ] Liaison officer and [ORG NCO  ] at the [ORG HQ  ] in [LOC Silopi  ] . 
PARTNER IN GWOT --------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S/NF ) Beyond its support for [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] has provided valuable assistance and cooperation to the GWOT . 
On Aug. 8 , [LOC Turkey  ] completed its second [ORG International Security Assistance Force  ] ( [ORG ISAF  ] ) command ( II and [ORG VII  ] ) in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , which it held for six months and during which time it contributed over 1,600 troops . 
[LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC France  ] and [LOC Italy  ] have agreed on an eight month rotating command of the [ORG ISAF Kabul Regional Command  ] starting the second half of 2006 . 
The GOT permits [ORG OEF  ] detainees ( [ORG Operation Fundamental Justice Flights  ] ) to transit [LOC Incirlik AB  ] . 
[LOC Turkey  ] also contributes to reconstruction and training efforts in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
It is involved in the reconstruction of schools and is exploring counter-narcotics training programs for [MISC Afghan  ] police and alternative livelihood options for poppy farmers . 
Following PM Erdogan’s May 2005 visit to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the GOT increased its reconstruction budget for [LOC Afghanistan  ] ten-fold , to $100 million . 
[LOC Turkey  ] continues to provide significant personnel and assets for [ORG Operation Active Endeavor  ] , [ORG KFOR  ] , and [ORG Operation Althea.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) Together with the [LOC US  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] coordinates military assistance to [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , improving their abilities to protect key energy transport routes . 
[LOC Turkey  ] subscribes to every security arrangement it is eligible to join , including the [ORG Proliferation Security Initiative  ] ( [ORG PSI  ] ) . 
It will host the first [ORG PSI  ] combined air , land and sea exercise ( [LOC ANATOLIAN DEER  ] ) in May 2006 and the [LOC US  ] is committed to participate in both the [ORG Command Post Exercise  ] and the [MISC Live Exercise.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [LOC Turkey  ] continues to resist significant cooperation on [LOC Black Sea  ] maritime security outside the context of [ORG BLACKSEAFOR  ] and [ORG Operation BLACK SEA HARMONY  ] ( [ORG OBSH  ] ) . 
The [LOC Turks  ] argue that an active U.S./NATO role would be threatening to the [MISC Russians  ] , who might respond negatively . 
That said , they raise no objection to our naval engagement in the region provided we abide by the [ORG Montreux Convention  ] which imposes restrictions on [ORG Bosporus Straits  ] passage. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) While [LOC U.S.  ] Navy ship visits to [LOC Turkey  ] fell drastically in 2004 and 2005 , with only four port visits each year , 2006 looks more promising . 
[ORG CVN  ] 71 [PER Theodore Roosevelt  ] and [ORG CG  ] 56 [LOC San Jacinto  ] are conducting a port visit in [LOC Marmaris  ] during February with another port call proposed for DDG 51 [PER USS Burke  ] later in the month . 
The July 2005 visit of the [ORG LPD USS Nashville  ] to the port of [LOC Aksaz  ] included the embarkation of 30 [ORG Turkish Naval Infantry  ] for training while continued use of [LOC Mersin  ] port by coalition fuel tankers are essential for fuels flowing into [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[LOC IRAN  ] AND [LOC SYRIA  ] --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( S ) Turkey’s watchword for both [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Iran  ] is “engagement.” While the military and [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] are concerned about the dangers of the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program , PM Erdogan’s pro-Islam Justice and [ORG Development Party  ] ( [ORG AKP  ] ) government is not yet convinced . 
PM [PER Erdogan  ] told [ORG EU  ] Ambassadors on January 20 that he does not believe [LOC Iran  ] intends to develop nuclear weapons ; one of his advisors had indicated the same sentiment one day prior . 
Part of the [MISC Turkish  ] government’s motivation is a desire not to jeopardize its nascent trade development opportunities , including energy , or its renewed intelligence exchange with [LOC Iran  ] on the [ORG PKK  ] . 
Some [ORG AKP  ] elements even admire Iran’s efforts to obtain nuclear weapons . 
According to [ORG TGS  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Iran  ] began sharing intelligence this summer on the [ORG PKK  ] , holding regular meetings at the border . 
As of September , [LOC Iran  ] had turned over 40 suspected [ORG PKK  ] members or sympathizers . 
[LOC Turkey  ] touts its support for the [MISC EU-3  ] dialogue and multilateral efforts through the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
[MISC Turkish  ] officials stress to us the need to maintain dialogue and to identify a diplomatic solution . 
The tepid [MISC Turkish  ] response to [MISC Iranian  ] President [MISC Ahmedinejad’s  ] initial statement about wiping [LOC Israel  ] off the map have been followed equally weak statements against the re-start of Iran’s uranium enrichment program . 
However , recent equivocation on whether or not [LOC Turkey  ] is planning for a visit by [MISC Ahmedinejad  ] demonstrates that [LOC Turkey  ] is trying to walk both sides of the line on [LOC Iran  ] . 
Turkey’s tack toward [LOC Syria  ] is much the same . 
They and others in the government regularly urge [LOC US  ] engagement and stress the need to deal directly with , and support [ORG Asad  ] ) whom they see as reform minded - against the hardline [LOC Ba  ] , athists in the regime who seek to undermine him . 
DEFENSE INDUSTRY COOPERATION WEAK --------------------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Historically the strongest area of our bilateral relationship , security cooperation , is significantly declining . 
Under Turkey’s current policy , the emphasis is on Direct Commercial Sales at the expense of Foreign Military Sales and [MISC American  ] companies are having difficulty competing . 
The last significant commercial tender won by a [LOC U.S.  ] firm was the 2002 win by [ORG Boeing  ] for an [ORG Air Early Warning and Control  ] ( [ORG AEW&C  ] ) system . 
In early 2004 , [ORG SSM  ] ( the [ORG Defense Industries Undersecretariat  ] ) [LOC Turkey  ] , s major procurement agency ) cancelled three tenders ( [ORG UAVs  ] , [LOC Main Battle Tanks  ] and attack helicopters ) all of which had [MISC American  ] companies in contention . 
General Atomics ( [ORG UAVs  ] ) and General Defense ( tanks ) have both pulled out of [LOC Turkey.  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The revised [ORG ATAK Helicopter  ] tender was issued in February 2005 and was the first to contain new standard ( i.e. , non-negotiable ) terms and conditions ( [ORG T&Cs  ] ) . 
( Note: The first tender was issued in 1995 and won by [MISC Bell Textron  ] . 
[ORG SSM  ] cancelled it over technology transfer issues . 
End Note . 
) The three [LOC US  ] firms that took the tender ( [LOC Bell  ] , [ORG Boeing  ] , [ORG Sikorsky  ] ) found the new [ORG T&Cs  ] so onerous that they were unable to justify participation. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The GOT , s goal is to develop an indigenous defense industry that can supply a significant portion of the [MISC Turkish  ] military , s requirements , and has outlined an aggressive timetable to do so . 
To meet that schedule , [ORG SSM  ] recently began requiring companies to confirm at the time of bid submission the host government’s willingness to allow transfer of the required technology . 
Although [ORG SSM  ] understands the [ORG USG  ] will not guarantee approval of technology transfer before a contract is signed , [ORG SSM  ] has refused to revise the tender to remove that requirement . 
[PER MND  ] and [ORG SSM  ] are requiring similar [ORG T&Cs  ] on other tenders and [MISC American  ] companies are frustrated . 
We have raised our concerns about the negative impact of the [ORG SSM  ] program on [LOC US  ] participation in the [MISC Turkish  ] defense market with FM Gul , [PER CHOD Ozkok  ] , [PER MND Gonul  ] , the service chiefs and others . 
Across the board , the military pledged their preference for [LOC US  ] equipment but professed an inability to influence the process . 
AIRSPACE MANAGEMENT ------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) We are currently working with the GOT on some airspace management issues in northern [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Over a 60 day period this fall , the [ORG TGS  ] noted 17 incidents where , they claim , [ORG CF  ] aircraft flew very close to the [MISC TU-IZ  ] border . 
These incidents result in alerting of [ORG TU  ] aircraft and other intensive actions , including scrambling F16s . 
After discussing this issue with [ORG TGS  ] , as a short term solution we have coordinated to have the relevant information passed from [LOC CENTAF  ] to the [MISC Turkish  ] [ORG Air Force  ] . 
We believe the long term solution is for the [MISC TGS/TUAF  ] to use [ORG CENTRIX  ] to obtain the daily [ORG Air Tasking Order  ] and determine if [ORG CF  ] flights may approach the [MISC Turkish  ] border . 
At present , the [MISC Turkish  ] military can access [ORG CENTRIX  ] through its LNOs located with [ORG Coalition Forces  ] , in [LOC Baghdad  ] , [LOC Mosul  ] , [LOC Kirkuk  ] , and [PER Tal Afar  ] ; There is also a [ORG CENTRIX  ] terminal at the [ORG ODC  ] in [LOC Ankara  ] . 
[ORG TGS  ] has yet to agree to the expense ( about $35,000 ) to have us install a [ORG CENTRIX  ] terminal at [LOC TGS HQ  ] , allowing them to have full access to [ORG CENTRIX  ] right here in [LOC Ankara  ] .
