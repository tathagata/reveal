( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: As part of the 40th [ORG Joint Political Military Group  ] ( [ORG JPMG  ] ) , [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG GOI  ] counterparts discussed security issues in the [LOC Near East  ] region . 
[ORG GOI  ] officials expressed support for the [ORG P5  ] plus 1 engagement process with [LOC Iran  ] , but doubted the process would lead to any change in [MISC Iranian  ] behavior -- [LOC Iran  ] will use the engagement process as an opportunity to continue its pursuit of a nuclear weapon . 
Assistant Secretary for [ORG Political Military Affairs  ] [PER Andrew Shapiro  ] stressed that engagement with [LOC Tehran  ] was not " open ended " ; the [LOC United States  ] is preparing sanctions in the event engagement does not prove successful . 
[ORG GOI  ] interlocutors continued to express concerns regarding [LOC U.S.  ] support of the [ORG Lebanese Armed Forces  ] ( [ORG LAF  ] ) ; [LOC U.S.  ] participants reiterated [LOC U.S.  ] support of the [ORG LAF  ] as a counterweight to [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
[PER A/S Shapiro  ] noted [ORG NEA  ] , with PM participation and support , plans to brief the [ORG GOI  ] on the [LOC U.S.  ] policy regarding [LOC Lebanon  ] in the near future . 
In a continuation from the [ORG JPMG Executive Session  ] , [ORG GOI  ] interlocutors made the argument that [LOC U.S.  ] arms transfers in the region could potentially arm future enemies of [LOC Israel  ] . 
[ORG GOI  ] officials expressed frustration over the [ORG Goldstone Report  ] ; [LOC U.S.  ] officials advocated sharing lessons learned regarding confronting terrorists in civilian-populated areas . 
[ORG GOI  ] officials noted improved counter-smuggling efforts from [LOC Egypt  ] regarding arms transfers to [LOC Gaza  ] via the [MISC Sinai  ] . 
However , they argued that [LOC Egypt  ] can and should do more to prevent the flow of arms . 
[LOC U.S.  ] delegation members also briefed on [LOC U.S.  ] policy in [LOC Iraq  ] , and expressed concerns about the current situation in [LOC Yemen  ] . 
This is the third of four cables ( septels ) reporting on the [ORG JPMG  ] .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) Main [MISC Israeli  ] [ORG Participants:  ] -- [ORG Brigadier General  ] ( res ) [PER Pinchas Buchris  ] , [ORG MOD  ] Director General -- [ORG Major General  ] ( ret ) [PER Amos Gilad  ] , [ORG MOD  ] Political-Military Chief -- [ORG Brigadier General Ronen Dan  ] , acting [MISC Israeli  ] [ORG Defense Attache  ] to the [LOC United States  ] -- [PER Gad Dovev  ] , Director , [ORG MOD  ] Mission , [ORG New York  ] -- [ORG Alon Bar  ] , MFA Deputy Director General for [ORG Strategic Affairs  ] -- [ORG COL  ] [PER Shimon Arad  ] , [ORG IDF J5  ] -- [PER Rami Yungman  ] , [ORG MOD  ] Political-Military [ORG Bureau  ] -- [PER Schmuel Royter  ] , Assistant to the [ORG MOD  ] Director General Main [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Participants:  ] -- [PER Andrew Shapiro  ] , Assistant Secretary , [ORG Bureau of Political-Military Affairs  ] -- [PER James Hursch  ] , Director , [ORG DTSA  ] -- Dr. [PER Colin Kahl  ] , [ORG International Security Affairs  ] , Deputy Assistant Secretary of [ORG Defense  ] -- [ORG Brigadier General Jefforey Smith , Joint Staff  ] -- [PER Beth McCormick  ] , Deputy Director , [ORG DSCA  ] -- [PER Prem Kumar  ] , Director for [MISC Israeli  ] , [MISC Palestinian  ] , [MISC Egyptian  ] and [ORG Jordanian Affairs  ] , [ORG NSC  ] -- [PER Tom Goldberger  ] , Director for [LOC Israel  ] and [ORG Palestinian Affairs  ] , [ORG Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs  ] -- COL [PER Richard Burgess  ] , [ORG Defense Attache  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [LOC Tel Aviv  ] -- [PER Robert Maggi  ] , PM Coordinator for [ORG Counter Piracy  ] -- [PER Kevin Maloney  ] , Licensing Director , PM/DTCL Plenary ------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG MOD  ] Director General [PER Pinchas Buchris  ] began the plenary , stating this was " perhaps the most important [ORG JPMG  ] to date . 
" He pointed to the threat of a nuclear [LOC Iran  ] , and expressed hope that [LOC U.S.  ] leadership will find a way to stop [LOC Iran  ] . 
Otherwise , a nuclear-armed [LOC Iran  ] will " impact the stability of the world , " [PER Buchris  ] said . 
[PER A/S Shapiro  ] described this 40th [ORG JPMG  ] as a key forum and the primary mechanism in the political-military dialogue between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Israel  ] . 
He said the [LOC United States  ] wants to " re-energize " the [ORG JPMG  ] , with the goal to " bring back strategic elements " into the discussion . 
[PER A/S Shapiro  ] highlighted the importance of mutual understanding and transparent dialogue . 
[LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG MOD  ] Political-Military Director [PER Amos Gilad  ] presented a strategic overview . 
He began with [LOC Iran  ] , reciting President [PER Obama  ] 's statement made during a visit to [LOC Israel  ] prior to becoming president that the [LOC United States  ] would not tolerate a nuclear [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Gilad  ] said [LOC Israel  ] concurs , and described current dialogue with [LOC Iran  ] as the " most sensitive stage " and [LOC Iran  ] 's " last chance . 
" He said [LOC Iran  ] remains determined to [LOC TEL AVIV  ] 00002502 002 OF 004 reach the " nuclear option , " which he described as " intolerable . 
" He quoted former President and [PER Ahmadinejad  ] opponent [PER Rafsanjani  ] as saying [LOC Iran  ] " only needs one bomb for [LOC Israel  ] , " implying that [LOC Iran  ] will continue to threaten [LOC Israel  ] regardless of its leadership. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER A/S Shapiro  ] noted that the [LOC United States  ] shares [LOC Israel  ] 's concerns that [LOC Iran  ] is pursuing a nuclear weapons program . 
He said that the [LOC United States  ] is beginning with engagement , but at the same time is preparing tougher measures should engagement fail . 
[PER A/S Shapiro  ] stressed that engagement was not " open ended " -- the [LOC United States  ] needs to see concrete steps and tangible results from the [ORG P5  ] 1 talks . 
He noted concerns over the [LOC Qom  ] facility ; if [LOC Iran  ] does not respond to engagement , then the [LOC United States  ] will move toward stronger steps such as sanctions . 
[PER DASD Kahl  ] reiterated that it is not our intention to allow [LOC Iran  ] to " run out the clock , " and noted that engagement also serves to build international consensus on sanctions . 
MFA Deputy Director for [ORG Strategic Affairs Alon Bar  ] argued that the [LOC United States  ] must present a clearer message to the [MISC Europeans  ] on what is expected of them regarding sanctions. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) A representative from [PER Mossad  ] said [LOC Tehran  ] understands that by reacting positively to engagement , [LOC Iran  ] can continue to " play for time " and avoid sanctions while pursuing its strategic objective to obtain a military nuclear capability . 
From [PER Mossad  ] 's perspective , there is no reason to believe [LOC Iran  ] will do anything but use negotiations to stall for time so that by 2010-2011 , [LOC Iran  ] will have the technological capability to build a nuclear weapon -- essentially reducing the question of weaponizing to a political decision . 
[PER Mossad  ] said [LOC Iran  ] 's main crisis is in the political sphere -- the current regime is weaker than prior to the elections , but does not face significant risk as its security apparatus remains loyal , while the opposition lacks a charismatic leader . 
The goal of the regime , therefore , is to calm down the domestic political environment -- [PER Khamenei  ] realizes the frustration demonstrated following the elections has not disappeared . 
BG Smith asked if [PER Khamenei  ] 's death might change the political landscape ; [PER Mossad  ] noted no information to suggest a change in [PER Khamenei  ] 's health , while those surrounding him appear more loyal than ever. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Mossad  ] believes [LOC Iran  ] wants to become a regional hegemon , and is dictating its agenda by using [ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] as force multipliers . 
In that respect , [LOC Iran  ] is very creative in finding ways to transfer weapons systems to its proxies . 
[PER Mossad  ] said [LOC Tehran  ] also understands the effort to split [LOC Syria  ] from [LOC Iran  ] 's influence , and is working hard to deepen its relationship with [LOC Syria  ] as a result . 
[PER DASD Kahl  ] argued that [LOC Iran  ] is weaker regionally today than in recent years . 
He noted progress in [LOC Iraq  ] , the results of the recent [MISC Lebanese  ] elections , and outreach to [LOC Syria  ] as signs of a weaker [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER DASD Kahl  ] also noted increased [LOC U.S.  ] credibility in the [MISC Muslim  ] world , while the crackdown following the [MISC Iranian  ] elections exposed the current regime as brutal to the region and in [LOC Europe  ] . 
Hizballah/Lebanon/Syria ----------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Gilad  ] addressed threats posed by " [MISC Hizballahstan  ] " and " [MISC Hamastan  ] , " noting that Hizballah/Hamas-Syria-Iran cooperation has strengthened . 
He noted that rockets from [LOC Lebanon  ] can now cover the entire territory of [LOC Israel  ] , while ballistic missiles -- although not new -- remain [LOC Israel  ] 's most serious threat with adversaries having the capability to target [MISC Israeli  ] citizens and major cities . 
[ORG IDF J5  ] Col [PER Shimon Arad  ] noted four main trends in Lebanon: 1 ) internal political deadlock since the elections ; 2 ) [ORG Hizballah  ] 's growing military capabilities ; 3 ) [LOC Lebanon  ] as a volatile military arena ; and 4 ) [LOC Lebanon  ] 's susceptibility to outside influences , including [LOC Syria  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
He recommended improved [MISC US.-Israel  ] coordination , and called for an exchange of views . 
[PER Arad  ] also recommended creating [MISC Lebanese  ] Armed Forces ( [ORG LAF  ] ) deconfliction measures , demanding improved [ORG LAF  ] performance , and exerting greater pressure on [LOC Syria  ] and smuggling . 
Finally , he called for sanctions on the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Republican Guard Corps  ] ( [ORG IRGC  ] ) , trilateral meetings with the [MISC Lebanese  ] and [ORG UNIFIL  ] to deter [ORG Hizballah  ] , and bolstering [ORG UNIFIL  ] by extending [PER Gen. Graziano  ] 's tour for an additional six months. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER A/S Shapiro  ] acknowledged the [ORG GOI  ] 's desire for specifics regarding [LOC U.S.  ] policy on [LOC Lebanon  ] , and hoped to invite [ORG GOI  ] representatives to [LOC Washington  ] in the near future for a full brief led by [ORG NEA  ] , with PM participation and support . 
He cited the need to provide an alternative to [ORG Hizballah  ] , which explains [LOC U.S.  ] goals to strengthen the [ORG LAF  ] as a counterweight . 
[PER DASD Kahl  ] argued that any [ORG LAF  ] cooperation [LOC TEL AVIV  ] 00002502 003 OF 004 with [ORG Hizballah  ] is pragmatic given the [ORG LAF  ] 's current weakness . 
He noted that [LOC U.S.  ] assistance has been temporarily put on hold since there is still no [MISC Lebanese  ] government . 
[PER Kahl  ] also argued that prospects for better relations with [LOC Damascus  ] depend on [MISC Syrian  ] desires for better relations with the [LOC United States  ] and the return of the [LOC Golan Heights  ] . 
[PER Arad  ] argued that more must be done to weaken radicals and cease smuggling . 
[PER Gilad  ] said the [ORG GOI  ] cannot envision a government in [LOC Lebanon  ] without [ORG Hizballah  ] , and said the [ORG LAF  ] will come to the defense of [ORG Hizballah  ] if attacked by [LOC Israel  ] -- thus , a strengthened [ORG LAF  ] hurts [LOC Israel  ] . 
[ORG QME  ] --- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Turning to [LOC U.S.  ] regional arms transfers , [PER Gilad  ] suggested [ORG Qualitative Military Edge  ] ( [ORG QME  ] ) as a " codename " for potential threats against [LOC Israel  ] . 
[LOC Israel  ] currently enjoys peace with regimes in [LOC Egypt  ] , [LOC Jordan  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , and the [LOC United Arab Emirates  ] -- but the future is uncertain , and each of these regimes faces the potential for change , he argued . 
[LOC U.S.  ] weapons -- " the best in the world " -- level the playing field by reducing the need for training -- and could ultimately aid a future enemy of [LOC Israel  ] , [PER Gilad  ] said . 
[PER A/S Shapiro  ] stressed the importance of transparency -- while there may be differences between [LOC Israel  ] and the [LOC United States  ] in terms of a regional assessment , the key is to ensure that there are no surprises , he said . 
Peace Process ------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Gilad  ] described the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process as a " pillar " of [MISC Israeli  ] security . 
He quoted PM [PER Netanyahu  ] and President [PER Peres  ] that [LOC Israel  ] remains sincerely committed to peace . 
[PER Gilad  ] noted however , that the re-launching of negotiations is complicated by the split in [MISC Palestinian  ] leadership . 
He said a weak and corrupt [ORG PA  ] had lost [LOC Gaza  ] despite [MISC Israeli  ] warnings . 
[PER Gilad  ] said 2010 will prove pivotal with [MISC Palestinian  ] elections looming and [MISC Egyptian  ] mediation efforts to broker reconciliation between [ORG Hamas  ] and the [ORG PA  ] having failed . 
That said , he noted that [MISC Israeli-PA  ] security and economic cooperation in the [LOC West Bank  ] continues to improve as [LOC Jenin  ] and [LOC Nablus  ] flourish , and described [MISC Palestinian  ] security forces as the " good guys . 
" NEA/IPA Director [PER Tom Goldberger  ] said Special Envoy Sen. [PER Mitchell  ] continues his mission , and noted that [MISC Egyptian  ] reconciliation efforts were meant to strengthen the [ORG PA  ] , not weaken it . 
[ORG Goldstone Report  ] ---------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Gilad  ] addressed [LOC Israel  ] 's immediate neighbors within the context of the [ORG Goldstone Report  ] . 
He said [LOC Israel  ] has checked " all the details " of the report , and have concluded that the report 's accusations are " baseless . 
" [PER Buchris  ] said the report sets a bad precedent for countries trying to protect its citizens from terrorists ; he noted 300,000 phone calls from the [ORG IDF  ] to houses in [LOC Gaza  ] ahead of strikes in the effort to prevent civilian casualties -- " no other country has taken such steps , " [PER Buchris  ] argued . 
[PER A/S Shapiro  ] highlighted strong [LOC U.S.  ] opposition to the report 's referral to the [ORG UN Security Council  ] , noting the report 's biased mandate. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Gilad  ] said [LOC Israel  ] only entered [LOC Gaza  ] after [ORG Hamas  ] violated the ceasefire or " tahdiya , " which many [MISC Israelis  ] felt was " humiliating " and left Defense Minister [PER Barak  ] open to criticism . 
[PER Gilad  ] characterized [ORG Operation Cast Lead  ] as a success that accounted for humanitarian issues ; the [ORG IDF  ] showed restraint in the operation because [LOC Israel  ] did not want to re-occupy [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[PER DASD Kahl  ] advocated sharing perspectives and lessons learned on strategic communication to more effectively confront terrorists in civilian-populated areas . 
NSC Director for [LOC Israel  ] and [ORG Palestinian Affairs Prem Kumar  ] noted continued [ORG UNSC  ] interest in the [ORG Goldstone Report  ] , and asked [LOC Israel  ] to inform the [LOC United States  ] on any additional efforts or investigations the [ORG GOI  ] was taking to help deflect any further damage from the report . 
Egypt/Counter-Smuggling ----------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Gilad  ] said [LOC Israel  ] was frustrated by its [MISC Arab  ] neighbors -- including specifically [LOC Egypt  ] -- for supporting the [LOC Goldstone Report  ] , which complicates the peace process . 
[LOC Israel  ] continues to benefit from good security cooperation with [LOC Jordan  ] , he said . 
[PER Gilad  ] argued that [LOC Egypt  ] could stop smuggling into [LOC Gaza  ] " completely , " and questioned whether [LOC Egypt  ] should be judged by its efforts or results . 
[PER Gilad  ] [LOC TEL AVIV  ] 00002502 004 OF 004 stressed the latter , and argued [LOC Egypt  ] can do more on counter-smuggling . 
Finally , he noted [MISC Israeli  ] concerns that [LOC Egypt  ] continues to prepare for a potential future military confrontation with [LOC Israel  ] , while no [MISC Egyptian  ] military officers visit [LOC Israel.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER A/S Shapiro  ] outlined [LOC U.S.  ] military assistance to strengthen [MISC Egyptian  ] border security , counter-terrorism , peacekeeping and civil defense efforts . 
He said the [LOC United States  ] is working with [LOC Egypt  ] to improve regional security efforts , such as counter-smuggling . 
Regarding the [ORG Gulf States  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [PER A/S Shapiro  ] stressed efforts to improve energy security and counter-terrorism , while bolstering the capabilities of the [ORG Gulf Cooperation Council  ] ( [ORG GCC  ] ) in the face of the [MISC Iranian  ] threat . 
Finally , he noted [LOC U.S.  ] withdrawal from the [MISC Anatolian Eagle  ] exercise following the [MISC Turkish  ] decision to suspend the [ORG IDF  ] 's participation . 
[PER A/S Shapiro  ] said the [LOC United States  ] has been delivering the message that [LOC Turkey  ] must improve its relationship with [LOC Israel.  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) PM Counter-Piracy Coordinator [PER Maggi  ] briefed on the counter smuggling technical discussion meeting ( septel ) . 
He cited the importance of working with [LOC Israel  ] 's neighbors -- including especially [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] -- to prevent [MISC Iranian  ] weapons from entering [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[PER Maggi  ] said more pressure should be applied in the [ORG EU  ] and [ORG UN  ] to gain more latitude -- and possibly further action from the [ORG EU  ] . 
He said tracking cash flows , and increasing prosecutions and incarcerations were important , with the ultimate goal of increasing cooperation and momentum . 
[PER Goldberger  ] said [LOC Egypt  ] sees [ORG Hamas  ] as a national security threat , and added that [LOC Egypt  ] had closed 200 tunnels since the beginning of 2009. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Goldberger  ] noted [MISC Egyptian  ] domestic political sensitivities , and questioned whether more commercial and humanitarian goods could be allowed through the [LOC Gaza  ] border crossings . 
[PER Gilad  ] strongly stated that there were no limits on commercial goods through the border crossings . 
[PER Goldberger  ] asked about construction materiel like cement ; [PER Gilad  ] said the [ORG GOI  ] would not allow [ORG Hamas  ] to build bunkers -- goods such as cement or iron would not be allowed because of their military applications . 
He also argued that smuggling is a lucrative business for all involved , including the [MISC Egyptian  ] government , and said the best way to stop the smuggling was to increase arrests and incarcerations . 
[PER Goldberger  ] mentioned [LOC U.S.  ] economic and development assistance efforts in [LOC Sinai  ] . 
He noted that most requests to third countries to deny arms transfer overflights are based on [MISC Israeli  ] intelligence ; additional information/intelligence from the [ORG GOI  ] would ensure greater cooperation . 
Bar raised prosecuting shipping companies complicit in arms transfers to [LOC Gaza  ] ; [PER A/S Shapiro  ] said he would take that back to [LOC Washington  ] for further consideration . 
Iraq/Yemen ---------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On [LOC Iraq  ] , [PER DASD Kahl  ] noted there are currently 125,000 [LOC U.S.  ] soldiers in [LOC Iraq  ] , which will be reduced to 50,000 soldiers by September 1 , 2010 with complete [LOC U.S.  ] troop withdrawal by the end of 2011 . 
He noted the [LOC U.S.  ] goal of establishing a long-term strategic relationship with a sovereign , stable , and self-reliant [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER A/S Shapiro  ] and [PER DASD Kahl  ] briefed the [ORG GOI  ] on [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to assist the [MISC Iraqi  ] military to complete its counterinsurgency force , transition the military to a force that can defend its borders , and align the [MISC Iraqi  ] military more closely to the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER DASD Kahl  ] pointed to the growing threat ( [PER al Qaida  ] , al [MISC Houthi  ] insurgency , and southern secessionists ) in [LOC Yemen  ] . 
He said the [LOC United States  ] is attempting to prevent [LOC Yemen  ] from heading toward an " [MISC Afghanistan-type  ] scenario " with general lawlessness and increased ungoverned spaces . 
[PER BG Smith  ] noted that al [PER Qaida  ] in the [LOC Islamic Maghreb  ] ( [ORG AQIM  ] ) continues to fester in [LOC North  ] and [LOC sub-Saharan Africa  ] . 
He said [LOC Egypt  ] is actively involved in countering [ORG AQIM  ] with 3,800 soldiers in [LOC Sudan  ] -- this should be encouraged and expanded. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( U ) [PER A/S Shapiro  ] has cleared on this cable .
