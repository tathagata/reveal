( C/NF ) SUMMARY: During separate discussions with OSD Assistant Secretary for [ORG International Security Affairs Alexander Vershbow  ] and [ORG EUR  ] Deputy Assistant Secretary [PER Spencer Boyer  ] in early February , [PER Roland Galharague  ] , MFA A/S-equivalent for [MISC Continental Europe  ] , adopted a defensive posture about the potential sale of [PER Mistral  ] class ships to [LOC Russia  ] ; expressed skepticism about the depth and durability of [LOC Russia  ] 's support for sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] ; acknowledged [PER Putin  ] 's dominance in [LOC Russia  ] while proposing , as a means to strengthen [PER Medvedev  ] , that we respond positively to his proposals for reforming [MISC European  ] security and holding an [ORG OSCE  ] summit ; asserted that [LOC Serbia  ] cannot win back [LOC Kosovo  ] and also win entry into the [ORG EU  ] ; expressed pessimism about the future of [LOC Nagorno-Karabakh  ] negotiations and about the impact of instability in [LOC Iran  ] on [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , [LOC Turkmenistan  ] , and [LOC Armenia  ] ; and claimed that [LOC Bosnia  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] could become difficult issues for trans-Atlantic relations this year because of the [ORG USG  ] 's alleged disengagement from [LOC Bosnia  ] and its alleged failure to consult adequately with [MISC European  ] [ORG NATO  ] allies on strategy in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
END SUMMARY. ----------------------------------------- MISTRAL: FRENCH ADOPT A DEFENSIVE POSTURE ----------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) When asked about the potential sale of [PER Mistral  ] class ships to [LOC Russia  ] , [PER Galharague  ] inquired as to why the [ORG USG  ] seems to be singling out [LOC France  ] for criticism on this issue . 
" I recently spoke to my [MISC Dutch  ] counterpart , " he reported , " and he said you have not approached him on this subject " despite recent [MISC Dutch  ] ( and [MISC Spanish  ] ) efforts to make similar sales . 
Furthermore , the [PER Mistral  ] is not " top end " military equipment , [PER Galharague  ] argued , describing it instead as a combination between " a truck and an oil ship " with some helpful navigation tools . 
It will not contribute significantly to [MISC Russian  ] military capabilities . 
[MISC Russian  ] leaders have been over-selling the military significance of the [PER Mistral  ] in order to quell domestic opposition to its purchase from abroad . 
Some [MISC Russians  ] consider the sale a harbinger of the end of shipbuilding in their country , and claim the ship could be built at home but would simply take longer . 
The production and sale of armaments is a major industry in [LOC Russia  ] , possibly second only to oil and gas . 
In his February 10 press conference , the Chairman of [LOC Russia  ] 's [ORG National Security Council  ] , [PER Nikolai Patrushev  ] , seemed " very reticent " about the possible sale , according to [LOC Galharague.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) Asked about [LOC Georgia  ] 's reaction to the possible sale , [PER Galharague  ] insisted that [LOC France  ] has maintained " very good " relations with [LOC Tbilisi  ] . 
The [MISC GOF  ] " strategy " for [LOC Georgia  ] to recover its lost territory is to persuade the [LOC Tblisi  ] government to engage with the leaders of the secessionist territories and to continue on their path toward [ORG EU  ] accession . 
The demands of accession -- such as internal democratic reforms and good relations with their neighbors -- will serve [LOC Georgia  ] and the region well . 
Nonetheless , [PER Galharague  ] acknowledged that [LOC Tbilisi  ] has good reason to fear [LOC Russia  ] , given their recent history . 
This ship will not , however , affect their strategic situation , [PER Galharague  ] argued: " The [MISC Russians  ] have already invaded [LOC Georgia  ] without the ship . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) While acknowledging that [LOC Georgia  ] and the [MISC Baltic  ] countries feel threatened by [LOC Russia  ] -- with reason -- [PER Galharague  ] concluded that [LOC Russia  ] is not a threat to us and there is no reason we should not sell equipment to them which does not fall into the realm of restricted armaments . 
The [PER Mistral  ] class ship does not contain high end or sensitive technology , he insisted. ------------------------------------------- RUSSIA'S COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP WITH [LOC IRAN  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) The [MISC Russians  ] are currently benefiting from their helpful statements on [LOC Iran  ] while realizing full well that [LOC China  ] will water down any sanctions proposals , [PER Galharague  ] asserted . 
When praising [LOC Russia  ] 's new stance , he argued , we should be cognizant of their complicated relationship with [LOC Iran  ] . 
[MISC Russians  ] have an interest in strong ties with [LOC Tehran  ] , especially because [LOC Iran  ] is still a primary market for [MISC Russian  ] arms sales . 
On the other hand , were [LOC Iran  ] to normalize its relations with western governments , it could develop into a major [MISC Russian  ] rival for gas sales to the [MISC European  ] market . 
To balance various and competing elements of its relationship with [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Russia  ] has an interest in serving as a " go-between " in the conflict between [LOC Iran  ] and the west . 
In fact , [PER Galharague  ] claimed , [MISC Russian  ] leaders were furious when [LOC Turkey  ] recently started to seize that mantel . 
[LOC PARIS  ] 00000207 002.2 OF 004 --------------------- [PER MEDVEDEV  ] VERSUS [PER PUTIN  ] --------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) When discussing the comparative influence of President [PER Medvedev  ] and Prime Minister [PER Putin  ] , [PER Galharague  ] claimed that [PER Medvedev  ] , whose initial gut reactions to events clearly differ from those of [PER Putin  ] , is trying to assemble his own power bases independent of the former President . 
In the meantime , " power still rests with [PER Putin  ] , " [PER Galharague  ] assessed . 
[PER Putin  ] , not [PER Medvedev  ] , constantly juggles and balances competing domestic interests in [LOC Russia  ] . 
As a case in point , [PER Galharague  ] cited the [MISC Russian  ] government 's reaction to the financial crisis . 
After the government painstakingly established a mechanism for determining how to divide stimulus funds among various economic sectors and private interests , [PER Putin  ] simply decided unilaterally who would receive state support . 
In general , [PER Galharague  ] observed , [PER Putin  ] much prefers to focus on domestic issues rather than foreign policy . 
[PER Putin  ] prefers cutting deals in the murky [MISC Russian  ] business world to delving into the complexities of international politics. --------------------------------------------- ------------- STRENGTHEN [PER MEDVEDEV  ] BY RESPONDING TO HIS SECURITY PROPOSAL --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Galharague  ] described the long-standing [MISC French  ] effort to strengthen [PER Medvedev  ] by respecting his official role as president of [LOC Russia  ] , regardless of [PER Putin  ] 's competing power and influence . 
" We treat [PER Medvedev  ] as president and address presidential issues with him . 
" They also seek to validate [PER Medvedev  ] 's initiatives , regardless of the substantive content , in order to reward his efforts to put new ideas forward . 
As an important example , [PER Galharague  ] mentioned [PER Medvedev  ] 's proposal for revamping [MISC European  ] security architecture . 
[PER Medvedev  ] invested a lot of political capital in this effort , [PER Galharague  ] argued , and we should provide a positive response , even if we do not accept the proposals . 
For this reason , President [PER Sarkozy  ] sent [PER Medvedev  ] a letter of acknowledgment after receiving the proposal . 
Tying this approach to [ORG USG  ] policy toward [LOC Russia  ] , [PER Galharague  ] several times asked how the [ORG USG  ] plans to measure the success of the " reset " with [LOC Russia  ] ? 
The [MISC French  ] , he said , would like to know whether the [ORG USG  ] has established benchmarks for progress , and they wonder how START negotiations might fit into this equation. ------------------------------------------- [MISC EUROPEAN  ] SECURITY: GOF SUPPORTS [ORG OSCE  ] SUMMIT ------------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Galharague  ] stated that the [MISC French  ] largely agree with us about how to address questions of [MISC European  ] security , except in one area: they support the idea of an [ORG OSCE  ] summit . 
While [LOC Paris  ] concurs with the [ORG USG  ] analysis that the [MISC Russian  ] proposals for reforming [LOC Europe  ] 's security institutions contain a number of " unacceptable " elements , he argued that we must understand that " we're playing a game of judo -- we do not want to give the [MISC Russians  ] a pretext to claim they're being ignored . 
" He added that the [MISC Russians  ] are adept at manipulation . 
" We constantly feel like we have a better hand but they're playing a better game -- it 's the same in business and economic arenas . 
" Claims of disrespect by western nations resonate in [MISC Russian  ] domestic politics , to our detriment , he warned . 
Therefore , we must emphasize the positive elements of the [MISC Russian  ] proposal and communicate a sincere willingness to engage . 
An [ORG OSCE  ] summit can help with these aims , [PER Galharague  ] argued , and at the same time support the [LOC Corfu  ] process . 
A summit would need to involve at least a minimum number of substantive issues , such as regional conflicts or the status of conventional forces in [LOC Europe  ] , but by agreeing to move ahead with the summit we would put the onus back on [LOC Russia.  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- BALKANS: [MISC SERBS  ] CAN'T WIN IN BOTH KOSOVO AND THE [ORG EU  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Galharague  ] asked that the [ORG USG  ] work together with the [ORG EU  ] to discourage the [MISC Serbians  ] from proposing a new [ORG U.N.  ] resolution on [LOC Kosovo  ] , stating that [MISC Serbian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Jeremic  ] " seems to believe [LOC Serbia  ] can win on [LOC Kosovo  ] and win [ORG EU  ] entry . 
We need to let him know this is not true . 
" Right now , [PER Galharague  ] reported , " the [MISC Serbs  ] are furious with us ( the [MISC French  ] ) " in response to the demarche the [MISC GOF  ] delivered in [LOC Belgrade  ] in early February ( reftel ) about [LOC Serbia  ] 's possible plans for a [ORG U.N.  ] resolution . 
" We delivered the message in very forceful terms . 
" In fact , the [MISC Serbs  ] interpreted the demarche as a major change in position , [PER Galharague  ] reported . 
[LOC PARIS  ] 00000207 003.2 OF 004 The [ORG EU  ] had thus far maintained the position that the issues of [LOC Kosovo  ] and [MISC Serbian  ] entry into the [ORG EU  ] were not formally linked . 
" There was no formal conditionality , " [PER Galharague  ] said , adding that the [MISC Serbs  ] now understand that to be a member of the [ORG EU  ] they must eventually recognize [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
" We told them we do not want another [LOC Cyprus  ] , " he explained , referring to [MISC Cyprus'  ] controversial [ORG EU  ] accession in 2004 as a divided island where [ORG EU  ] legislation remains partly " suspended " in the northern part of the island which is outside of the government in [LOC Nicosia  ] 's control . 
Nonetheless , [PER Galharague  ] predicted the [MISC Serbs  ] will likely go ahead with the [ORG U.N.  ] resolution in any case , and the [ORG USG  ] and the [ORG EU  ] will be forced to oppose it. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C/NF ) Furthermore , [PER Galharague  ] asserted , before the [MISC Serbs  ] join the [ORG EU  ] , they will need to resolve key issues with [LOC Kosovo  ] in the fields of justice , police , customs , transport , agriculture , and also any differences over names and terminology . 
The best way for [LOC Serbia  ] to address issues related to [LOC Kosovo  ] is by working with the [ORG European Union Rule  ] of [LOC Law Mission  ] in [LOC Kosovo  ] ( [LOC EULEX  ] ) . 
" At the end of the day , though , " he reiterated , " [LOC Serbia  ] must recognize [LOC Kosovo  ] if it wants to join the [ORG EU  ] . 
" ------------------------------ PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE [LOC CAUCASUS  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C/NF ) The [ORG Nagorno-Karabakh  ] negotiations appear to be at a " dead end , " [PER Galharague  ] averred , adding that " [LOC Minsk  ] ( The [ORG Minsk Group  ] ) is going nowhere fast . 
" He noted that the [MISC French  ] government is not in a position to push the [MISC Armenians  ] at the moment because [MISC French  ] citizens of [MISC Armenian  ] origin " represent about 500,000 votes " and [MISC French  ] regional elections will take place in March . 
Other factors may soon impact the Caucasus region , he warned , such as instability in [LOC Iran  ] . 
[LOC Azerbaijan  ] , [LOC Armenia  ] , and [LOC Turkmenistan  ] all have important trade and energy ties with [LOC Iran  ] and they could be immediately affected by the [LOC Iran  ] sanctions bill currently making its way through the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] . 
At the same time , the effort to impose harsher [ORG U.N.  ] sanctions may offer us an opportunity to further engage with those three countries about their approach to [LOC Iran.  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- FUTURE USG-EU FLASHPOINTS: [LOC BOSNIA  ] AND [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C/NF ) When assessing potential issue areas where the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG EU  ] may differ during 2010 , [PER Galharague  ] focused first on [LOC Bosnia  ] . 
He said the [MISC French  ] are disappointed that the [ORG USG  ] appears to have put all plans and actions on hold pending the elections in October . 
Indeed , he implied that [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] officials have differing assessments of the need for continual engagement with the conflicting parties in [LOC Bosnia  ] . 
[MISC Bosnian  ] parties will not make progress without unity between the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [ORG EU  ] . 
When the [MISC Americans  ] disengage , even temporarily , [PER Galharague  ] claimed the [MISC Bosnians  ] perceive it immediately and react accordingly: " The [MISC Americans  ] are giving up , so why should we do this ( make compromises ) ? 
" The [ORG USG  ] , the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG EU  ] presidency , and High Representative [ORG Ashton  ] should lead the charge in engaging this year -- " we need [LOC U.S.  ] backing now , " he urged . 
As a lever to press the [MISC Bosnians  ] forward on constitutional issues , the [ORG EU  ] may be able to use the ruling by the [ORG European Court of Human Rights  ] , which declared that the [MISC Bosnian  ] Constitution does not conform with [MISC European  ] human rights standards. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Galharague  ] described [LOC Afghanistan  ] as the second potential trans-Atlantic flashpoint in 2010: " There is an emerging feeling the war is not jointly owned and managed . 
" President [PER Obama  ] waited eight months to make a decision and , during that period , at no point did [MISC European  ] opinion factor into his deliberations , according to [PER Galharague  ] . 
[PER DAS Boyer  ] firmly disagreed , citing [ORG USG  ] consultations and discussions with [MISC French  ] officials in [LOC Paris  ] and in [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC DC  ] . 
[PER Galharague  ] acknowledged these discussions took place , but claimed the question [MISC Americans  ] posed to their [MISC European  ] [ORG NATO  ] allies was not " What do you think ? 
" but " How many troops can you put on the ground ? 
" More recently , he said , the [ORG USG  ] has begun contemplating engagement with elements of the [ORG Taliban  ] without consulting [MISC European  ] [ORG NATO  ] allies . 
The [MISC French  ] would like to know , for instance , what this engagement might mean for our future relations with [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC India.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C/NF ) In purely political terms , [PER Galharague  ] explained that [LOC Afghanistan  ] has developed into a difficult issue , especially in [LOC France  ] . 
With the [MISC French  ] death toll in [LOC Afghanistan  ] having reached 40 , he noted , local politicians have found themselves increasingly faced with grieving families , to whom they must explain the purpose of the war . 
[LOC PARIS  ] 00000207 004.2 OF 004 " The perception is that we're there because the [MISC Americans  ] are there , " he said . 
" We're not sure where we're going and we're not being asked or consulted . 
" Initially , the majority of [MISC Europeans  ] supported the war in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , invoking [ORG Article Five  ] of the [ORG NATO  ] Charter and committing a " fairly high " amount of troops and resources . 
But now " no one knows the purpose " of the war . 
" Perhaps the [MISC French  ] government should have made a better show of the consultations " that did take place , [PER Galharague  ] admitted , " but to display them you have to have them . 
" <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C/NF ) EMBASSY COMMENT: [PER Galharague  ] is not ultimately responsible for the [MISC Afghanistan-Pakistan  ] region , which is handled by a separate cell within the [ORG MFA  ] , so his comments may not reflect the views of those who regularly engage with the [ORG USG  ] on this issue . 
Notably , when discussing public and official perceptions of the war in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , he made no mention of [PER SRAP Holbrooke  ] 's two visits to [LOC Paris  ] in the last three months , or post 's constant exchanges about [LOC Afghanistan  ] with [MISC French  ] officials at the senior and working levels . 
[PER Galharague  ] focused on a perception of minimal consultation , which he admitted could persist regardless of reality . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( U ) ASD Vershbow and [PER DAS Boyer  ] have cleared this cable .
