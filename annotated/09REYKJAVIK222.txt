The Government of [LOC Iceland  ] stated in its most recent terrorist threat assessment , conducted by the [ORG National Police  ] Commissioner in 2008 , that the likelihood of terrorist activities occurring in [LOC Iceland  ] is low . 
In the same assessment , however , the government concluded that the potential consequences of such activities were severe enough to merit a high level of vigilance . 
The government , therefore , continued its efforts to strengthen domestic border security and counterterrorism capabilities during the year . 
The [ORG National Police  ] Commissioner has primary responsibility for counterterrorism efforts in the country . 
An elite counterterrorism unit , called the [ORG Viking Squad  ] , is considered the first line of defense in [LOC Iceland  ] 's efforts against terrorism . 
The unit is comprised of approximately 45 members and specializes in various types of paramilitary techniques . 
The [ORG National Security Unit  ] , which also falls under the jurisdiction of the [ORG National Police  ] Commissioner , gathers intelligence , drafts threat assessments and exchanges information with foreign counterparts with the aim to prevent or reduce the likelihood of terrorism . 
The [ORG Icelandic Coast Guard  ] ( [ORG ICG  ] ) is responsible for [LOC Iceland  ] 's coastal defense and monitors the ocean around [LOC Iceland  ] , both within and outside of territorial waters . 
The [ORG ICG  ] served as the [ORG Chair of the North Atlantic Coast Guard  ] Forum in 2009 and hosted the organization 's annual conference in September . 
Also in September , the [ORG ICG  ] hosted [LOC Northern Challenge  ] 2009 , a [MISC NATO-supported  ] exercise focusing on explosive ordnance disposal and counterterrorism scenarios . 
The [ORG ICG  ] cooperates closely with its counterparts in the [ORG U.S. Coast Guard  ] and signed a cooperative agreement in 2008 that increased bilateral security cooperation . 
The [ORG Icelandic Defense Agency  ] ( [ORG IDA  ] ) has responsibility for operational ties with [ORG NATO  ] and other allied states . 
The [ORG IDA  ] , which currently falls under the jurisdiction of the [ORG Ministry for Foreign Affairs  ] , is also responsible for monitoring [MISC Icelandic  ] airspace via the [ORG Icelandic Air Defense System  ] ( [ORG IADS  ] ) . 
In May , the [ORG IDA  ] coordinated the third annual round of high level security dialogue talks between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Iceland  ] since the closure of the [ORG Naval Air Station  ] in [LOC Keflavik  ] ( [LOC NASKEF  ] ) in 2006 . 
The government announced in December that the [ORG IDA  ] would be dissolved in 2010 and that its functions , along with those of several other agencies , will be merged into a prospective [ORG Ministry of Interior Affairs  ] . 
The [MISC Icelandic  ] government supported multilateral counterterrorism efforts . 
[LOC Iceland  ] continued its deployment of personnel at [ORG Kabul International Airport and International Security Assistance Force  ] ( [ORG ISAF  ] ) [ORG Headquarters  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] in support of [ORG NATO  ] operations . 
As a country participating in the [MISC Visa Waiver Program  ] ( [ORG VWP  ] ) , [LOC Iceland  ] continued to comply with requirements in the [ORG VWP  ] law related to information sharing and other law enforcement and counterterrorism cooperation . 
This cooperation was further enhanced by the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 [ORG Commission Act  ] of 2007 .
