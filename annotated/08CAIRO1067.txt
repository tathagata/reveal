End summary . 
President [PER Mubarak  ] ----------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The codel began by thanking [PER Mubarak  ] for his positive leadership on regional issues . 
[PER Mubarak  ] said that he had advised Vice President [PER Cheney  ] and other [LOC U.S.  ] officials not to invade [LOC Iraq  ] and that " no one listened , " but that now " it would be a mistake " to withdraw forces immediately because it would further open the door for [LOC Iran  ] . 
Asked about [MISC U.S.-Egypt  ] relations , [PER Mubarak  ] confirmed that " we have very good relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] , " but " your administration is not well-informed . 
" However , " I am patient by nature , " he said , in apparent reference to [LOC U.S.  ] criticisms over human rights and democratization . 
Congressman [PER Shays  ] encouraged [PER Mubarak  ] to engage with [LOC Iraq  ] as much as possible and asked if [LOC Egypt  ] would send an ambassador , to which [PER Mubarak  ] replied " no , I cannot do it . 
When there is stability I am willing , but I cannot force civilians to go . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Asked about [LOC Egypt  ] 's reaction if [LOC Iran  ] developed nuclear weapons capability , [PER Mubarak  ] said that none will accept a nuclear [LOC Iran  ] , " we are all terrified . 
" [PER Mubarak  ] said that when he spoke with former [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Khatami he  ] told him to tell current President [PER Ahmedinejad  ] " not to provoke the [MISC Americans  ] " on the nuclear issue so that the [LOC U.S.  ] is not forced to strike . 
[PER Mubarak  ] said that [LOC Egypt  ] might be forced to begin its own nuclear weapons program if [LOC Iran  ] succeeds in those efforts. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Asked about whether the [LOC U.S.  ] should set a timeline for withdrawal from [LOC Iraq  ] , [PER Mubarak  ] said " you cannot leave " because " you would leave [LOC Iran  ] in control . 
" [PER Mubarak  ] explained his recipe for a way forward: " strengthen the armed forces , relax your hold , and then you will have a coup . 
Then we will have a dictator , but a fair one . 
Forget democracy , the [MISC Iraqis  ] are by their nature too tough . 
" [PER Omar Soliman  ] ------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [MISC Egyptian  ] General Intelligence Service ( EGIS ) chief [PER Omar Soliman  ] gave the codel an expansive evaluation of the key issues in the region . 
He focused on [LOC Iran  ] 's growing influence in [LOC Iraq  ] , with [ORG Hamas  ] , with [ORG Hizballah  ] in [LOC Lebanon  ] , and with [MISC Shia  ] communities in the [LOC Gulf  ] . 
To solve regional problems [LOC Egypt  ] is working on three tracks - [LOC Palestine  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] , and [LOC Iraq.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [LOC Egypt  ] hopes to achieve something soon on the [MISC Palestinian  ] track , he said , but neither side is ready to stop the vicious circle of violence , although most on both sides want " quiet . 
" [PER Soliman  ] 's job now , he said , is to bridge the gaps on specific issues like border crossings , prisoner exchange , and bringing [ORG Hamas  ] and the [LOC PA  ] back together . 
He hoped to see an agreement on borders for a [MISC Palestinian  ] state by the end of 2008 , and noted that as a practical matter very few [MISC Palestinian  ] refugees would seek right of return. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) On [LOC Lebanon  ] , speaking a week before the [LOC Doha  ] agreement was penned , [PER Soliman  ] said the three problems are [LOC Syria  ] 's large influence , lack of power of the majority over militia forces , and weak [MISC Arab  ] support for the government . 
[LOC Syria  ] is seeking a deal with [LOC Israel  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] over returning the [LOC Golan  ] and canceling the [PER Hariri  ] tribunal to lessen its meddling and [LOC Lebanon  ] needs a strong , nationalist army . 
[PER Soliman  ] bemoaned that the [MISC Arab  ] states have too poor relations with [LOC Syria  ] to [LOC CAIRO  ] 00001067 002 OF 002 push them effectively. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) On [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] meets regularly with [LOC Jordan  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC UAE  ] , [LOC Kuwait  ] , and [LOC Turkey  ] to discuss reducing [MISC Iranian  ] influence . 
The [MISC GOI  ] must understand it has support from the [MISC Arabs  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] , not just [LOC Iran  ] , he said . 
[PER Soliman  ] advocated making [LOC Iran  ] suffer economically to be " too busy with its people " to make problems in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Reducing [MISC Iranian  ] influence will help the [MISC Iraqi  ] government become one , and not a competition between [PER Sunni  ] and [ORG Shi'a.  ] he said. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Asked about the consequences of any [LOC U.S.  ] strike on [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear capabilities , [PER Soliman  ] said such an attack would not destroy [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear capabilities and would only unite [MISC Iranians  ] with their leadership and against the [LOC U.S.  ] He repeated the need to make [LOC Iran  ] " busy with its people " by effective sanctions , citing the successful example of [LOC Libya  ] . 
Asked about [LOC Sudan  ] , he said that [LOC Egypt  ] is still working to make north-south unity attractive , and to encourage talks between the [ORG GOS  ] and rebels and between [PER Bashir  ] and [ORG Deby.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Asked what it means when [MISC Arabs  ] say that the [LOC U.S  ] . 
" should listen to us , " [PER Soliman  ] gave the example that President [PER Mubarak  ] warned Vice President [PER Cheney  ] about the consequences of the [LOC U.S.  ] invading [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Additionally , " your unilateral positions on economic aid are difficult . 
" However , [PER Soliman  ] emphasized that [LOC Egypt  ] is keen to continue to have a " very close " relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] ------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Gamal  ] opined that the " battle lines are clearer for [LOC Egypt  ] than ever before " on regional issues . 
The region " will not realize its full potential as long as geopolitical problems continue , " he said . 
With the [MISC Israeli/Palestinian  ] problem in particular , " we are racing against time . 
" [PER Gamal  ] advocated close engagement by the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] , and other countries ( NFI ) in order to make practical improvements in the every day lives of [MISC Palestinians  ] and develop a framework for a final deal , with borders as the key issue . 
Other regional issues such as [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Lebanon  ] are " much more complicated , " he said ; " the picture is not that rosy . 
" <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Representative [PER Baird  ] raised the issue of USAID efforts to assist conservation of [LOC Red Sea  ] reefs , which [PER Gamal  ] agreed was an important issue . 
Representative [PER Shays  ] asked [PER Gamal  ] 's opinion of [LOC Syria  ] President [PER Bashar Al Assad  ] , to which [PER Gamal  ] replied that " he understands the world better than his father , " but that he is worried that opening up politically or economically could result in a loss of control. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Representative [PER Harman  ] asked for [LOC Egypt  ] to do more to fight smuggling to [LOC Gaza  ] through tunnels , perhaps by setting up roadblocks a few miles before the border to intercept contraband . 
[PER Gamal  ] said that the border is a " shared concern " and [LOC Egypt  ] is doing what it can to address smuggling. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Representative [PER Fortenberry  ] asked about how to counter a developing [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program . 
[LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , as well as [LOC Jordan  ] , are the " heavyweights " that can counter [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Gamal  ] said , but he advocated movement on the [MISC Israeli/Palestinian  ] track to remove a prime issue that [LOC Iran  ] can use as a pretext . 
[ORG American Chamber of Commerce  ] in [LOC Egypt  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG AmCham  ] group led by President [PER Omar Mohanna  ] ( [ORG Suez Cement  ] ) lamented that the lack of a [MISC U.S.-Egypt  ] [ORG FTA  ] continues to push [LOC Egypt  ] 's trade towards [LOC Europe  ] and away from the [LOC U.S.  ] They praised the [ORG Qualified Industrial Zones  ] ( [ORG QIZ  ] ) program and advocated expanding it to upper [LOC Egypt  ] , though they acknowledged that increasing [MISC Egyptian  ] textile exports to the [LOC U.S.  ] would be a sensitive issue in the [LOC U.S.  ] textile lobby . 
[PER Karim Ramadan  ] ( [ORG Microsoft  ] ) praised the historic role of USAID in [LOC Egypt  ] and asked that it continue with a focus on education and health , areas in particular need of development in [LOC Egypt  ] .
