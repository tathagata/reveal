( A ) 05 [ORG CARACAS  ] 2807 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
( B ) [ORG CARACAS  ] 239 <a id='parC' href='#parC'>¶</a>C . 
( C ) [ORG CARACAS  ] 853 Classified By: Economic Counselor [PER Darnall Steuart  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [ORG Repsol Drill Project Manager  ] for the [PER Rafael Urdaneta  ] offshore natural gas exploratory well told [MISC Petroleum Attache  ] on August 2 that [ORG Repsol  ] had cancelled plans to drill in [LOC Cuba  ] , as it had been unable to secure an offshore drill rig with less than fifteen percent [LOC U.S.  ] content. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added that the [MISC Spanish  ] oil company has experienced several challenges over the last month in its [PER Urdaneta  ] drill program . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] shared that [ORG PDVSA  ] recently seized vessels in the [LOC Gulf  ] of [LOC Venezuela  ] owned by [MISC Venezuelan  ] launch company [LOC Terminales Maracaibo  ] that had been servicing the off-shore rig . 
The service company has the contract to provide [ORG Chevron  ] , [ORG Repsol  ] , and [ORG Teikoku  ] with launch services in the [LOC Gulf  ] to transport crew and supplies to the rig . 
[LOC Terminales Maracaibo  ] continued to operate vessels not expropriated in May 2009 until [ORG PDVSA  ] recently expanded the scope of the expropriation beyond assets physically located on [LOC Lake Maracaibo  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] indicated that [ORG Repsol  ] has not been able to find a replacement launch company ( as there are few private launch companies left in [LOC Venezuela  ] ) and is increasingly reliant on [ORG PDVSA  ] to provide launch services to maintain its drilling program. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also noted that during the first week of drilling , the rig was shut down for 36 hours due to a shortage of diesel fuel . 
The rig temporarily shut down again the weekend of August 1 due to another fuel shortage . 
Problems within [ORG PDVSA  ] 's domestic fuel distribution system are driving this problem . 
( NOTE: The [ORG GBRV  ] nationalized the downstream oil sector , including tanker trucks and gas stations in September 2008 , and has slowly integrated private tanker trucks into its fleet . 
) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] shared that [ORG Repsol  ] had been unable to lease some specialized drill tools from [ORG Schlumberger  ] as it had exported them out of [LOC Venezuela  ] and was not willing to bring them back . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that [ORG Repsol  ] had also encountered some technical difficulties with the drilling program ( NFI ) . 
Based on current progress , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believes [ORG Repsol  ] will complete its exploratory well within the next four to six weeks. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that [LOC Japan  ] 's [ORG Teikoku  ] has offered jobs to [ORG Repsol  ] 's entire senior drilling team , asking them to transfer with the drill rig from [ORG Repsol  ] . 
[ORG Teikoku  ] has drill engineers preparing its exploratory well in the [LOC Moruy II  ] block , but has not put into place a management team to execute the program ( e.g. project supervisor , operations manager , drill rig supervisor , etc . 
) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) COMMENT: [ORG Repsol  ] 's problems in securing launch vessels and diesel fuel underscore some of the unintended consequences of [ORG GBRV  ] nationalizations of downstream operations and the oil services sector . 
Its inability to secure specialized drill tools from [ORG Schlumberger  ] confirms reports that companies are quietly removing capital equipment from [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
END COMMENT .
