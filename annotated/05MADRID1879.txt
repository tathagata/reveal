( C ) Summary . 
The [ORG U.S.-Spain Council  ] , a private bi-national [ORG NGO  ] dedicated to strengthening [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] relations , held its tenth annual meeting May 13-16 in [LOC Seville  ] . 
Participants included [ORG U.S. Council  ] Chairman Senator [PER Chris Dodd  ] , EUR DAS [PER Glyn Davies  ] , Charge [LOC Manzanares  ] , [MISC Spanish  ] Minister of [ORG Defense  ] [PER Jose Bono  ] , Foreign Minister [PER Miguel Angel Moratinos  ] , [ORG Spain Council  ] Chairman [PER Antonio Garrigues  ] , regional political officials , and business leaders from both countries . 
Prince [PER Felipe  ] hosted a dinner for meeting participants on the second evening of the event . 
The most newsworthy development during the [ORG Council  ] meetings was Minister of [ORG Defense  ] [PER Bono  ] 's strong , but personal , public support for maintaining the [ORG EU China  ] arms embargo ( while making clear that FM [PER Moratinos  ] had the final word on [LOC Spain  ] 's position on the arms embargo ) and his acknowledgement that he may have committed " errors " during his tenure as MOD , a reference to his statements/measures that have upset [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] bilateral relations . 
[PER Bono  ] informed Charge that he had made both comments at the request of Secretary of Defense [PER Rumsfeld  ] . 
Separately , [PER Moratinos  ] urged the creation of a [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] bilateral commission to meet at the ministerial level on an annual basis to discuss regional issues of mutual concern , as well as recommending other measures to enhance bilateral relations . 
While the comments of both ministers were largely positive , veiled swipes at opposition support for [LOC U.S.  ] policy in [LOC Iraq  ] reflected a continuing temptation to drag the [ORG USG  ] into domestic political debates . 
End Summary. //DEFENSE MINISTER ON [LOC CHINA  ] ARMS EMBARGO// <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Bono  ] used a speech to participants in the tenth annual meeting of the [ORG U.S.-Spain Council  ] to announce his personal opposition to the lifting of the [ORG EU  ] arms embargo on [LOC China  ] . 
He said that it did not make sense to lift the arms embargo now simply because " a particular [ORG EU  ] country wants to sell weapons to [LOC China  ] . 
" [PER Bono  ] told Charge privately that he had made this statement to honor a request made by Secretary [PER Rumsfeld  ] during their May 3 meeting in [LOC Washington  ] that [PER Bono  ] make public his views on the [LOC China  ] arms embargo. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) While [PER Bono  ] was careful to note in his speech that FM [PER Moratinos  ] had the ultimate word on the [LOC China  ] arms issue within the [MISC Spanish  ] government , his comments nonetheless created a stir during an otherwise routine meeting of the [ORG Council  ] . 
Charge learned that FM [PER Moratinos  ] and [ORG Socialist Party  ] Director for International Relations [PER Trinidad Jimenez  ] called [PER Bono  ] after his speech to criticize the way he had framed the issue . 
[PER Bono  ] 's comments came just hours after Moratinos' elaboration of a more nuanced position that tracks with that of its [ORG EU  ] allies ( see para 9 . 
) [PER Bono  ] 's statement apparently came as a surprise to members of his staff as well ; an MOD contact called Embassy 's Spanish-national political assistant ( who was present for the speech ) to verify [PER Bono  ] 's declaration. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Separately , [PER Bono  ] said during his speech that he may have committed " errors " during his tenure as Defense Minister and attributed these mistakes to his lack of experience in the MOD role . 
[PER Bono  ] told Charge that this admission , like his comments opposing the lifting of the [ORG EU China  ] arms embargo , came at the urging of Secretary [PER Rumsfeld  ] . 
[PER Bono  ] made clear that he wanted Secretary [PER Rumsfeld  ] to be informed that he had complied with both requests. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Bono  ] 's comments were not uniformly positive . 
He said international peace could not be achieved " without the [LOC U.S.  ] or without the legitimacy ( conferred by ) the [ORG United Nations  ] , " an implicit defense of the [ORG Zapatero  ] government 's withdrawal of troops from [LOC Iraq  ] on the grounds that the intervention lacked a [ORG UN  ] mandate . 
Also , [PER Bono  ] made a general comment to the effect that his [ORG Jesuit  ] education had taught him that " the ends do not always justify the means . 
" ( NOTE: Emboffs in attendance interpreted this as a veiled criticism of the [LOC Iraq  ] conflict and of the opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] 's decision to join the [MISC U.S.-led  ] coalition . 
END NOTE . 
) //FOREIGN MINISTER CALLS FOR FORMATION OF [MISC U.S.-SPAIN  ] BILATERAL COMMISSION// <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) [PER Moratinos  ] made a wide-ranging speech on [MISC U.S.-EU  ] relations and praised President [PER Bush  ] 's expression of support for a strong [LOC Europe  ] during his February visit to [LOC Brussels  ] . 
He said [ORG NATO  ] remained [LOC Europe  ] 's primary security organization and argued that there was no contradiction between a strong [ORG NATO  ] and the elaboration of a common [ORG EU  ] security and defense policy . 
[PER Moratinos  ] recommended increased personnel exchanges between the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [ORG EU  ] and the formation of an " [ORG EU  ] caucus " in the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Senate  ] as mechanisms for further strengthening [MISC U.S.-EU  ] ties . 
[PER Moratinos  ] lauded the [ORG USG  ] role in the international community , particularly its part in resolving the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] dispute. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) The most notable element of Moratinos' speech was his call for the establishment of a permanent [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] bilateral commission to meet at least once a year at the ministerial level for discussions on regional issues , particularly on [LOC Latin America  ] , the [LOC Middle East  ] , and the [MISC Mediterranean  ] basin . 
[PER Moratinos  ] suggested other measures for strengthening [MISC U.S.-Spanish  ] relations , including: -- joint initiatives to promote shared democratic values in [LOC North Africa  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] ; -- the reinforcement of institutional contacts , for example through events such as the June 6-10 visit to [LOC Washington  ] by members of the [ORG Spanish Parliamentary Commission  ] on International Relations ; -- increased education exchanges to promote mutual understanding ; -- the establishment of a joint scientific/industrial research and development institution ; and , -- the formation of a joint business organization by private sector members of the [ORG U.S.-Spain Council.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) [PER Moratinos  ] described current [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] relations in positive terms . 
He noted [LOC Spain  ] 's participation in peacekeeping efforts in [LOC Bosnia  ] , [LOC Kosovo  ] , [LOC Haiti  ] , and [LOC Afghanistan  ] and said [LOC Spain  ] could be an important partner for the [ORG USG  ] in other areas as well . 
[PER Moratinos  ] said [LOC Spain  ] 's advantages included its place as the world 's eight largest economy ( " bigger than that of [LOC G-8  ] member [LOC Canada  ] " ) , its influence in [LOC Latin America  ] , [LOC North Africa  ] , and the [LOC Middle East  ] , and [LOC Spain  ] 's role in the fight against terrorism. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) While focused on positive aspects of the bilateral relationship , Moratinos' speech also touched briefly on points of friction . 
He said [LOC Spain  ] had " recovered the capacity to engage " the [MISC Cuban  ] and [MISC Venezuelan  ] governments , overcoming the tensions those relationships suffered during the [ORG Aznar  ] administration . 
He insisted that [LOC Spain  ] was not pursuing dialogue as an end in itself , but seeking increased influence in order to advocate for improved human rights practices on the part of the [MISC Cuban  ] government and to preserve the rights that still exist in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
On the [ORG EU China  ] arms embargo , [PER Moratinos  ] noted that any arms sales would be governed by strict [ORG EU  ] controls , but said [LOC Beijing  ] had to take steps to improve human rights conditions before this issue could move forward. //PP PARTICIPANT TAKES SHOTS AT [LOC ZAPATERO//  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) [ORG Popular Party  ] leader [PER Mariano Rajoy  ] declined an invitation to participate in the [ORG Council  ] meetings , but [ORG PP Parliamentary  ] spokesman on international relations [PER Gustavo Aristegui  ] did attend and mounted a withering attack on [ORG Zapatero  ] 's handling of [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] relations . 
[PER Aristegui  ] said the [ORG GOS  ] was now taking steps to correct its early mistakes , but without publicly acknowledging that it had committed grave errors . 
His Socialist counterpart [PER Rafael Estrella  ] ( considered among the more pro-U.S . 
Socialist parliamentarians ) fired back , asking how the [ORG USG  ] would view it if a former president visited [LOC Europe  ] to militate unceasingly against the policies of an incumbent administration . 
( NOTE: Both [PER Aristegui  ] and [PER Estrella  ] will be part of the Parliamentary delegation that will visit [LOC Washington  ] June 6-10 . 
They have invited Charge to meet with them prior to their departure to review their agenda for the visit . 
) //COMMENT// <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) MOD [PER Bono  ] is among the most popular [MISC Spanish  ] politicians and his speech before the [ORG U.S.-Spain Council  ] demonstrated his rhetorical skills . 
He used the presence of the media and [ORG USG  ] officials to comply with assurances he had reportedly made to Secretary [PER Rumsfeld  ] , while leaving to FM [PER Moratinos  ] the unpleasant duty of clarifying [LOC Spain  ] 's official position on the [ORG EU China  ] arms embargo . 
For now , the [ORG GOS  ] has evidently opted not to clarify the matter publicly in order to avoid the appearance of internal discord . 
More broadly , we note that both [PER Bono  ] and [PER Moratinos  ] continue to fight a two-front political battle with the opposition [ORG PP  ] , on the one hand claiming that relations with the [ORG USG  ] are as strong as ever , and on the other casting [ORG PP  ] support for [ORG USG  ] policies in [LOC Iraq  ] as somehow illegitimate and contrary to international law . 
[ORG GOS  ] officials have clearly tempered their public statements on [LOC Iraq  ] in the last five months , but our efforts to keep them from dragging the [ORG USG  ] into their domestic political battles remain a work in progress .
