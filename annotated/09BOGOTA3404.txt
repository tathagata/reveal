( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC SUMMARY: On October 15  ] , 2009 AmEmb [LOC Bogota  ] 's consular [ORG Fraud Prevention Unit  ] ( [ORG FPU  ] ) met with the head of the passport office at the [MISC Colombian  ] [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) , [PER Mauricio Acero  ] . 
[PER Acero  ] requested the meeting to alert [ORG FPU  ] to a fraud trend whereby foreign nationals fraudulently obtain [MISC Colombian  ] civil documents which are then used to request passports . 
Investigations by the [ORG MFA  ] have led to the revocation of fraudulently-obtained passports of 24 individuals , while 340 cases remain under investigation . 
The cases most frequently involve people of [MISC Lebanese  ] descent , but also [MISC Syrians  ] , [MISC Palestinians  ] , [MISC Jordanians  ] , [MISC Venezuelans  ] , and [MISC Cubans  ] . 
END SUMMARY. --------------------------------------------- Citizenship fraud begins with civil documents --------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Acero  ] highlighted that [LOC Colombia  ] 's civil documents system is ripe for fraud as the requirements for obtaining birth certificates are lenient . 
Once an individual is in possession of a [MISC Colombian  ] birth certificate they can obtain a national identification number , which is then used to get a passport . 
With a valid national [LOC ID  ] , the [ORG MFA  ] is required by law to issue a passport . 
[PER Acero  ] requested that Embassy personnel voice concern about gaps in citizenship procedures in the course of high-level contacts with the [MISC Colombian  ] government. ---------------- Fraud indicators ---------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The perpetrators of citizenship fraud , according to [PER Acero  ] , tend to be male and between the ages of 20-25 . 
They often use a baptism certificate to establish their place of birth ( instead of the customary hospital certification of birth ) and claim to have been born at home . 
Often the two mandatory witnesses of the birth will be indigenous . 
The birth certificate , national identification card and passport will often have issuance dates in close proximity . 
In the case of [MISC Lebanese  ] , [MISC Syrians  ] , [MISC Palestinians  ] , and [MISC Jordanians  ] the subject 's first ( paternal ) last name will be [MISC Arab  ] and the second ( maternal ) last name will be [MISC Spanish  ] . 
Through a series of legal procedures , the paternal last name is dropped over time . 
The cases tend to come from [LOC Maicao  ] , [LOC San Andres  ] , [LOC Barranquilla  ] , and [LOC Ipiales.  ] --------------------------------------- Motivations to commit citizenship fraud --------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Acero  ] told [ORG FPU  ] that [MISC Lebanese  ] , [MISC Syrians  ] , [MISC Palestinians  ] , and [MISC Jordanians  ] are motivated to obtain [MISC Colombian  ] citizenship to hide criminal records , avoid military service in their home country , provide a better future for their children , and for ease in international travel . 
The motivations for [MISC Cubans  ] and [MISC Venezuelans  ] , on the other hand , are less clear . 
[PER Acero  ] hypothesized that some [MISC Cubans  ] might wish to escape the regime while others might be using [ORG BOGOTA  ] 00003404 002 OF 002 a [MISC Colombian  ] identity as a cover for [MISC Cuban  ] intelligence operations . 
As for [MISC Venezuelans  ] , he said that the motivations are still unclear. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG FPU  ] spoke with other agencies at Post about the trend . 
They noted that this is an on-going issue and concurred that the motives tend to be to hide criminal backgrounds. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While [PER Acero  ] did not point to specific malfeasance involving [LOC U.S.  ] visas , [ORG FPU  ] appreciated the information and is on the look-out for the fraud indicators highlighted . 
[ORG FPU  ] requested the names of the 340 individuals under investigation for citizenship fraud . 
The request is under consideration by the [ORG MFA  ] .
