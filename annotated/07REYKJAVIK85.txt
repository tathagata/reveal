It is essential to use the [ORG USNATO  ] trips to educate [MISC Icelandic  ] officials and journalists on the changing security threats of the 21st century , including [ORG NATO  ] 's mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and to demonstrate how the [LOC United States  ] will abide by its commitment under the 1951 [ORG Defense Agreement  ] and [ORG NATO  ] accords to defend [LOC Iceland  ] against external threats. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 .

Mr. [PER Kristjansson  ] believes the [ORG USNATO  ] trip would deepen his understanding of the complex situation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and would give him the opportunity to obtain on-the-record comments from [LOC US  ] and [ORG NATO  ] officials , which he would use in developing stories to send back to [LOC Iceland  ] during his trip. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 .
