Sensitive but Unclassified - not for [MISC Internet  ] distribution. <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) Welcome to The [ORG Hague  ] . 
Your visit to The [ORG Hague  ] can strengthen ties with a proven ally on many issues , especially on nonproliferation and counterterrorism . 
As co-chair of the 5th [ORG Plenary Meeting  ] of the [ORG Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism  ] ( GICNT ) , your focus will be on multi-lateral engagements . 
The following points on [MISC Dutch  ] political events and specific foreign policy issues are background for your bilateral meetings with [MISC Dutch  ] leaders. -------- Overview -------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As a matter of policy and preference , the [LOC Netherlands  ] primarily pursues its foreign policy interest within the framework of multilateral organizations , where the [MISC Dutch  ] seek and often hold prominent roles far out of proportion to the small size of their nation . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] see no contradiction between being good [MISC Europeans  ] and good transatlanticists . 
They support both [ORG NATO  ] and the [ORG EU  ] and have engaged energetically to ensure that these two organizations pursue complementary rather than competitive objectives . 
In general , the [MISC Dutch  ] share our view that the future of the transatlantic relationship will be determined less by what the [LOC U.S.  ] does in [LOC Europe  ] than by what the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Europe  ] do together globally . 
They take their global responsibilities seriously and they usually are determined to include the [LOC United States  ] in their global planning . 
They nurture democracy and human rights as a matter of policy. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Dutch  ] political parties represent the political spectrum from far left to far right . 
The coalition government is made up of the [ORG Christian Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) with 41 seats in the lower chamber of parliament , the [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) with 33 seats , and the [ORG Christian Union Party  ] with 6 seats ( out of a 150 seat Second Chamber/Tweede Kamer ) . 
The government has survived some heated debates over the last year , including a difficult decision on the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) program last month . 
Political posturing has already begun for the 2011 parliamentary elections . 
The tensions within the coalition are heightened by the sharp rise in popularity and gains in the recent [ORG EU  ] elections of the extreme right [ORG Freedom Party  ] ( [ORG PVV  ] ) headed by [PER Geert Wilders  ] , who plays to the emotions of the population on such divisive issues as immigration , religion , and individual rights. ------------------------------------ [ORG Counterterrorism & Non-Proliferation  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) The [MISC Dutch  ] strongly subscribe to multilateral efforts to curb the spread of weapons and materials of mass destruction . 
They have supported [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to uphold the [ORG Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  ] ( [ORG NPT  ] ) , especially in the instance of [LOC Iran  ] . 
They are charter member of the [ORG Proliferation Security Initiative  ] ( [ORG PSI  ] ) , actively participate in the [ORG Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism  ] ( GICNT ) , and are members of the [ORG G-8 Global Partnership Against  ] the Spread of Weapons and Materials of [ORG Mass Destruction  ] . 
In addition to their effort in the political arena , they have committed financial resources to fund chemical weapon destruction facilities in the former [LOC Soviet Union  ] . 
[MISC Dutch  ] actively engage in virtually every non-proliferation fora and have consistently put the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons at the top of their priorities for a common foreign Qweapons at the top of their priorities for a common foreign policy within the [ORG EU  ] . 
They are leaders in the GICNT as shown by hosting the 5th [ORG Plenary Meeting  ] in The [ORG Hague.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) The [MISC Dutch  ] are clearly taking the terrorist threat very seriously , expending significant financial and human resources since 9/11 to fight this problem . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] is a close ally in the fight against global terrorism . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] has ratified all the [ORG UN  ] anti-terrorism conventions and , as a major financial center , takes strict measures to prevent terrorist financing very seriously . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] is an active member of the [ORG Financial Action Task Force FATF  ] ) and other groups fighting these financing networks . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have held trials for two groups suspected of plotting major terrorist attacks in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
While not all the defendants were convicted , many were . 
In addition , at the request of the [ORG USG  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] extradited one of their own nationals ( a [MISC Dutch-Iraqi  ] dual citizen ) to the [LOC U.S.  ] to stand trial for attempting to commit terrorist acts against [MISC American  ] targets in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
That deportee recently plead guilty in [LOC U.S.  ] court. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) The [LOC Netherlands  ] has the second highest number of [MISC Muslims  ] as a share of the population ( roughly 5 percent ) in [LOC Western Europe  ] . 
This fact means the [MISC Dutch  ] take seriously the potential threat of [MISC Islamic  ] radicalization producing &home grown8 terrorists . 
The grizzly murder of [MISC Dutch  ] film maker [PER Theo van Gogh  ] in 2004 , by a radicalized native-born [MISC Dutchman  ] of [MISC Moroccan  ] extraction , drove home this point. ------ [LOC Russia  ] ------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) The [MISC Dutch  ] support strong [MISC Russian-European  ] relations , but are troubled by anti-democratic trends within [LOC Russia  ] and skeptical of [MISC Russian  ] intentions in the territories of the former [LOC Soviet Union  ] , especially [LOC Georgia  ] . 
Within the [ORG EU  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] lie between those states pushing for closer relations with [LOC Russia  ] ( i.e . 
[LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] ) and those new members whose [MISC Soviet-era  ] experience makes them instinctively suspicious of [LOC Moscow  ] . 
From this middle-ground , the [MISC Dutch  ] are well-positioned to advocate a positive but realistic [MISC Russian-European  ] agenda . 
Former [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Putin  ] visited the [LOC Netherlands  ] in November 2005 , and Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] reciprocated by visiting [LOC Moscow  ] in November 2007 . 
Although [PER Balkenende  ] was later criticized in Parliament for signing a major pipeline deal with [ORG GAZPROM  ] during the visit , he also used the occasion to speak out publicly in support of human rights and to meet with [MISC Russian  ] [ORG NGOs  ] promoting the rule of law . 
[MISC Dutch  ] officials also argue that [MISC Dutch  ] participation in the [ORG GAZPROM  ] deal will bring greater transparency to the process of bringing [MISC Russian  ] natural gas to [MISC European  ] markets . 
President [PER Medvedev  ] is scheduled to visit the [LOC Netherlands  ] in late [LOC June.  ] ---- [LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) The [MISC Dutch  ] share [LOC U.S.  ] concerns about the [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear program and the [LOC U.S.  ] view that [LOC Iran  ] must comply with its obligation sunder the [ORG NPT  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have supported the efforts on the &EU-38 ( [LOC UK  ] , [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] ) in negotiating with the [MISC Iranians  ] to cease reprocessing of nuclear materials and open their facilities to [ORG IAEA  ] inspection . 
The [ORG Dutch Parliament  ] , concerned about the human rights situation in [LOC Iran  ] , continues to push the government to take a tougher approach to [LOC Iran  ] than that favored by many [ORG EU  ] members. ---------- CONCLUSION ---------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) To sum up , the [MISC Dutch  ] leadership are strongly committed to nonproliferation and take an active role in promoting an agenda that parallels ours . 
Your bi-lateral engagements with the [MISC Dutch  ] will be very welcome and they will look to you for insights into the new [ORG Administration  ] 's thinking on the future of the myriad of issues confronting nonproliferation and counterterrorism challenges .
