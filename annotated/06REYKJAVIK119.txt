( C ) Summary: In informal conversation 3/31 [ORG Icelandic Ministry of Justice Deputy Permanent  ] Secretary disclosed to Embassy that [ORG Coast Guard  ] Director [PER Georg Larusson  ] has lost the confidence of Minister of [ORG Justice  ] [PER Bjarnason  ] because he is not seen as a team player . 
This explains why decisions about search and rescue ( [ORG SAR  ] ) provisions to follow on from the planned departure of the 56th RQS from [MISC Naval Air Station  ] Keflavik ( [ORG NASKEF  ] ) are being handled in [PER Bjarnason  ] 's private office , which has hired a consultant to vet helicopter sales offers , with the [ORG ICG  ] largely cut out of the action . 
Embassy advises [LOC U.S.  ] officials for now to work directly with [ORG Icelandic Justice Ministry  ] officials on [ORG Coast Guard  ] issues as [PER Larusson  ] 's tenure appears increasingly troubled . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On the margins of the March 31 bilateral defense talks ( reftel ) , poloff discussed with [ORG Iceland Ministry of Justice  ] and [ORG Ecclesiastical Affairs Deputy Permanent  ] Secretary [PER Stefan Eiriksson  ] ( strictly protect ) the ministry 's planning for near-term replacement of the [ORG SAR  ] assets [LOC Iceland  ] will lose when the 56th RQS departs [LOC Iceland  ] shortly as part of [ORG NASKEF  ] downsizing. . 
[PER Eiriksson  ] , a 36-year-old lawyer , is also his ministry 's head of police and judicial affairs , in which role he has oversight of the [ORG Iceland Coast Guard  ] ( [ORG ICG  ] ) . 
Poloff inquired into how [PER Eiriksson  ] 's boss , Justice Minister [PER Bjorn Bjarnason  ] , has given him only until Easter to come up with an interim plan . 
Asked if he was working all hours or felt he had things under control , [PER Eiriksson  ] answered , " A bit of both . 
" He explained that the [ORG Ministry had  ] contracted for the services of a 72-year-old former Icelandair Director of Operations and Chairman of the [ORG Association of European Airlines  ] Committee on Technology and Operations , engineer [PER Leifur Magnusson  ] , to evaluate the sales offers that have been pouring into the Ministry from helicopter manufacturers ( note: including [ORG Sikorsky  ] ; end note ) . 
[PER Magnusson  ] contributed much-needed technical expertise to Ministry deliberations. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Poloff asked why the decision-making on [ORG SAR  ] assets was being handled in this way by [MISC Ministry  ] principals rather than delegated to the presumed subject-matter experts at the [ORG ICG  ] . 
[PER Eiriksson  ] confided that [PER Bjarnason  ] is fed up with leaks and public complaints from the [ORG ICG  ] and is tempted to privatize some of its functions . 
[MISC Icelandic  ] law enforcement functions that have been partially privatized , such as the call center service on the country 's 112 ( equivalent to [LOC U.S.  ] 911 ) line , have worked well , [PER Eiriksson  ] observed . 
The contractors seem happy to have the work and get on with their job without any whining . 
In contrast , [ORG ICG  ] officials are frequently heard in the press complaining that they do not have enough resources properly to carry out their responsibilities -- thus creating a public relations headache for the [MISC Minister.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Poloff then asked why , indeed , the [ORG ICG  ] found itself in the position of making public pleas for greater funding . 
[ORG ICG  ] Director [PER Larusson  ] , in the job since January 2005 following a successful stint as Immigration Director ( also under the [ORG Justice Ministry  ] ) was believed to be [PER Bjarnason  ] 's personal pick for his job , as someone who understood 21st-century security challenges and shared [PER Bjarnason  ] 's hard line on law enforcement . 
[PER Eiriksson  ] offered that [PER Larusson  ] 's management of the [ORG ICG  ] has been somewhat of a disappointment . 
Unlike the National Commissioner of Police ( [ORG NCP  ] ) , for example , [PER Larusson  ] has not been willing to make tough choices about where to use the resources he has been given . 
[PER Larusson  ] will get more resources when he has demonstrated the capacity effectively to husband what he has -- and not before , [PER Eiriksson  ] declared. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment: While the motivation for [PER Eiriksson  ] 's surprising candor is unclear , the accuracy of what he said appears to be supported by recent observations of [PER Larusson  ] and his top policy deputy , Commander [PER Asgrimur Asgrimsson  ] ( note: a [ORG U.S. Coast Guard  ] Academy graduate ; end note ) . 
At a meeting with [ORG U.S. Coast Guard  ] Commandant [PER Thomas Collins  ] March 28 that [PER Eiriksson  ] also attended , [PER Larusson  ] seemed unusually taciturn and distracted . 
[PER Asgrimsson  ] pointedly asked [PER Collins  ] whether the [ORG USCG  ] saw any advantage in privatizing some rescue services and visibly welcomed the Commandant 's answer that he did not . 
He afterwards complained to poloff that the people making decisions for the [ORG ICG  ] these days were not consulting with the professionals there , resulting in lowered morale at the organization . 
Under the circumstances , potential [LOC U.S.  ] interlocutors may be wise to route their proposals for [ORG ICG  ] reforms through [PER Eiriksson  ] , whose political star seems to be on the rise -- or at least not imploding .
