Reasons 1 . 
4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [ORG EU  ] Mission Political Counselor [PER Alexander McLachlan  ] told PolOff January 29 that some [ORG EU  ] member states were annoyed with [MISC Spanish  ] Ambassador to [LOC China  ] [PER Blasco Villa  ] 's recent statements to [MISC Chinese  ] media that suggested that the [ORG EU  ] would consider lifting its arms embargo against [LOC China  ] . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] Ambassador had spoken carefully enough to avoid speaking explicitly on behalf of the [ORG EU  ] , [PER McLachlan  ] said , but he had still given the [MISC Chinese  ] the unfortunate impression that there were exploitable differences among [ORG EU  ] member states on this issue . 
" This is the [MISC Spanish  ] talking and seeking advantage at other [ORG EU  ] states' expense , " he said . 
" The [MISC Chinese  ] recognize that and do not believe the [MISC Spanish  ] , but now they are using the issue as a lever against us . 
" <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER McLachlan  ] pointed out that [ORG PRC  ] Premier [PER Wen Jiabao  ] had stated explicitly at the December 2009 PRC-EU Summit that [LOC China  ] expected the [ORG EU  ] to lift the arms embargo before the next summit , tentatively scheduled for October 2010 to coincide with the [ORG Asia-Europe Meeting  ] . 
[ORG PRC  ] media had commented recently ( at least three separate articles in newspapers January 29 ) on the [ORG EU  ] arms embargo and called for it to be lifted. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) " There isn't even a mechanism for discussing lifting the arms embargo , " [PER McLachlan  ] said , noting that public opinion in the [ORG EU  ] would not support such an action at this time and that , in any case , before lifting the embargo the [ORG EU  ] would need to consult very carefully with the [LOC United States  ] to ensure that such a move would not jeopardize [LOC Europe  ] 's access to [LOC U.S.  ] arms and technology. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER McLachlan  ] allowed that there was some support among " pragmatic " [LOC China  ] experts in the [ORG EU  ] for lifting the embargo . 
These voices argued that the [ORG European Union  ] 's code of conduct for arms exports , a legally binding document , was more stringent than the [LOC China  ] arms embargo , which [PER McLachlan  ] claimed was a non-binding " political declaration . 
" The embargo singled out [LOC China  ] , had no legal effect and was an outsized irritant in [MISC Sino-EU  ] relations , [PER McLachlan  ] argued . 
For these reasons , new [ORG EU  ] High Representative for Foreign Affairs [PER Catherine Ashton  ] was considering whether there might be a way to " get off the back foot " on this issue with [LOC China  ] while still keeping a de-facto embargo in place. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER McLachlan  ] 's prediction was that there would be no movement on lifting the embargo beyond provocative statements by [LOC Spain  ] during its presidency , because despite the benefits to [MISC Sino-EU  ] relations of lifting the embargo , the consequences from the [LOC United States  ] and from [MISC Europeans  ] angry at [LOC China  ] 's human rights record would be too much to ignore .
