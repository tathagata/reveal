Susman  ] for reasons 1.4 b and d. <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C/NF ) Summary . 
Reining in the [MISC UK’s  ] debt will be the greatest challenge facing the party that wins the expected May 6 general election , [ORG Bank of England  ] Governor [PER Mervyn King  ] told the Ambassador in a February 16 meeting . 
While neither party has adequately detailed plans to reduce the deficit , [PER King  ] expressed great concern about Conservative leaders’ lack of experience and opined that Party leader [PER David Cameron  ] and Shadow Chancellor [PER George Osborne  ] have not fully grasped the pressures they will face from different groups when attempting to cut spending . 
[PER King  ] also raised concerns about the global economic recovery , arguing that global growth in 2010 would be anemic and a double-dip recession remained a possibility . 
Greece’s profound economic troubles will trigger a further consolidation in power within the euro-zone , with [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC France  ] likely to impose the right to scrutinize if not exercise some control over [MISC Greek  ] government accounts in return for an implicit or explicit guarantee , he predicted . 
The [LOC UK  ] has been on the sidelines in the debate over [LOC Greece  ] and could have less influence in the [ORG EU  ] , as [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC France  ] will seek greater political cohesion in the euro-zone in the aftermath of the [MISC Greek  ] crisis , he stated . 
End Summary Bleak [LOC UK  ] and [ORG Global Economic Picture  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) For the next ten months , the [LOC UK  ] faces the challenge of adopting deficit-reduction measures , controlling inflation and addressing rising unemployment . 
The deficit is expected to reach 12.6 percent of GDP in 2010 . 
Inflation for the twelve-month period , December 2009 to December 2010 , reached 3.5 percent , primarily a result of the return of the VAT rate to 17.5 percent and higher energy prices . 
[PER King  ] predicted that inflation would drop to two percent this year , since energy prices are expected to stabilize , with oil price per barrel remaining at or near USD 70 . 
The [LOC UK  ] also likely faces rising unemployment . 
Businesses will cut jobs faster this year and eliminate many part-time positions , as employers realize that economic recovery will be a long , drawn-out process , said [PER King  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] already has gone through this pain of rising unemployment , and saw in the last quarter of 2009 , a rise in productivity . 
The [LOC UK  ] - and [LOC Europe  ] in general - has not gone through this restructuring , and productivity fell throughout 2009. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) The global picture was also worrisome , commented [PER King  ] . 
At the February 6 G7 meeting in [LOC Iqualit  ] , [LOC Canada  ] , the [MISC German  ] and [MISC Japanese  ] Finance Ministers , raised concerns about weak domestic consumption and the slow recovery of export trade , [PER King  ] stated . 
While China’s domestic spending , primarily on its large infrastructure projects , helped ameliorate the worst of the global economic crisis , there has been no noticeable change in domestic consumption . 
China’s consumers will not lead economic growth , he said . 
Given these factors , as well as the high [LOC U.S.  ] unemployment and [ORG Europe’s  ] expected rising unemployment , it was hard to be optimistic about recovery in 2010 , [PER King  ] argued , and noted a double-dip recession was still a possibility . 
Conservatives - Not Prepared ---------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) Conservative leaders [PER David Cameron  ] and [PER George Osborne  ] do not fully grasp the pressures they will face when attempting to cut back on spending , when “hundreds of government officials will make pleas of why their budgets should not be reduced , ” stated [PER King  ] . 
In recent meetings with them , he has pressed for details about how they plan to tackle the debt , but received only generalities in return . 
Both [PER Cameron  ] and [PER Osborne  ] have a tendency to think about issues only in terms of politics , and how they might affect [MISC Tory  ] electorability . 
[PER King  ] also raised concerns that Osborne’s dual roles as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer but also as the Party’s general election coordinator could create potential problems in the approach on economic issues. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) [PER King  ] also expressed concern about the [MISC Tory  ] party’s lack of depth . 
[PER Cameron  ] and [PER Osborne  ] have only a few advisors , and seemed resistant to reaching out beyond their small inner circle . 
The [MISC Cameron/Osborne  ] partnership was not unlike the [PER Tony Blair/Gordon Brown  ] team of New Labour’s early years , when both worked well together when part of the opposition party , but fissures developed - for many reasons - once [ORG Labour  ] was in power . 
Similar tensions could arise if [PER Cameron  ] and [PER Osborne  ] disagreed on how to handle the deficit , and the lack of depth in their inner circle , would aggravate the situation . 
[LOC LONDON  ] 00000364 002 OF 002 Greece’s Problems Will [LOC Re-Define Euro-Zone  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC France  ] will ultimately have no choice but to offer explicit guarantees of [MISC Greek  ] debt , argued [PER King  ] . 
The euro-zone could not risk a [MISC Greek  ] default and euro devaluation would not be an acceptable political option for [LOC Germany  ] or [LOC France  ] . 
[LOC Germany  ] and [LOC France  ] will likely , as a condition of any guarantee , require the ability to scrutinize if not exercise some control over the [MISC Greek  ] budget . 
Longer-term , the drive for greater political cohesion will accelerate . 
The EU’s one single success was the monetary union , and now that success has been undermined . 
Leaders in [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC France  ] have recognized that allowing monetary union to happen without corresponding political cohesion was a mistake and one that needed to be rectified , [PER King  ] opined. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) The euro-zone’s move to greater political cohesion could poise some disadvantages for the [LOC UK  ] , [PER King  ] speculated . 
During the February 16 ECOFIN meeting , euro-zone governments politely listened to Chancellor Darling when he commented on the situation in [LOC Greece  ] , but he was not invited to attend internal discussions since the [LOC UK  ] is not part of the euro-zone . 
It would be incumbent for the [LOC UK  ] to demonstrate that it has something meaningful to say and to be constructively engaged in the [ORG EU  ] , should this greater political cohesion among the euro-zone governments occur , commented [PER King  ] .
