[LOC SYRIA  ] AND [LOC LEBANON  ] ----------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) With the [MISC Syrian  ] Foreign Minister coming to [LOC Morocco  ] on February 26 , Ambassador [PER Welch  ] inquired about [LOC Syria  ] 's cooperation with [LOC Morocco  ] . 
[PER Mansouri  ] said that while it was not all that [LOC Morocco  ] desired , it has improved in the last few months . 
[PER Welch  ] said the [MISC Syrians  ] have recognized that the foreign fighter pipeline may pose a risk to their own country . 
However , [LOC Syria  ] continued to exert a great deal of pressure on [LOC Lebanon  ] and appeared determined to maintain its interests in [LOC Lebanon  ] at any cost . 
Prior to the [LOC Annapolis  ] conference , [LOC Syria  ] had been relatively quiet vis-a-vis the [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
However , three or four weeks ago , it hosted the conference of rejectionists . 
[LOC Damascus  ] has lost the support of many [MISC Arab  ] friends , and the [ORG Arab League Summit  ] is insufficient incentive to achieve better behavior. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) A/S [PER Welch  ] asked how [LOC Lebanon  ] could be a threat to [LOC Syria  ] ; yet [LOC Syria  ] is bent on destroying [MISC Lebanese  ] institutions , i.e. , the government , the army , and the central bank . 
As a result , the [LOC United States  ] was increasing its assistance to [LOC Lebanon  ] , working in tandem with [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC France  ] , the [LOC United Kingdom  ] , and other friends . 
[PER Mansouri  ] interjected that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC Jordan  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] 's positions had evolved . 
[PER Welch  ] noted that family , intelligence , and business are all one in [LOC Syria  ] . 
He ended that portion of the discussion by stressing [LOC U.S.  ] support for a political solution and a short-term focus on maintaining and strengthening [MISC Lebanese  ] institutions . 
[LOC ISRAEL  ] AND THE [ORG MEPP  ] ------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Turning to [LOC Israel  ] , [PER Welch  ] said that the good news was real albeit unseen . 
He assured [PER Mansouri  ] that the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] talks were addressing all issues and were making progress . 
He told [PER Mansouri  ] that the Secretary and then the President intend to return to the region . 
More [MISC Arab  ] financial assistance to the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] would be helpful . 
[PER Mansouri  ] said that he and Foreign Minister [PER Taieb Fassi Fihri  ] had met [MISC Israeli  ] Foreign Minister [PER Livni  ] and found RABAT 00000194 002 OF 003 her serious . 
[ORG GAZA  ] AND [LOC EGYPT  ] -------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The conversation then turned to [LOC Gaza  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Welch  ] noted that the [ORG GOE  ] had contained 300,000 [MISC Palestinians  ] within the [MISC Sinai  ] after they spilled across the frontier . 
Meanwhile , [ORG Hamas  ] was not using funds it received from [LOC Iran  ] to improve the humanitarian situation . 
Asked about the expected transition in [LOC Egypt  ] , [PER Mansouri  ] agreed that the army would not control the next transition . 
He nonetheless expected a " monarchical succession . 
" THE MAGHREB ----------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Moving west , [PER Mansouri  ] said [LOC Morocco  ] and [LOC Libya  ] enjoyed very good relations and agreed on many regional issues . 
[PER Mansouri  ] noted that [LOC Libya  ] continues to believe that [MISC Saudi  ] Wahabism is the source of terrorism in the region . 
[PER Welch  ] acknowledged that [MISC Libyan-U.S.  ] relations are currently strained due to historical disputes . 
[PER Mansouri  ] was surprised when [PER Welch  ] expressed concern about [LOC Tunisia  ] . 
[PER Mansouri  ] said [LOC Morocco  ] is quite concerned about the greed and brittleness of the [PER Ben Ali  ] regime . 
[PER Mansouri  ] added that the December 2006/January 2007 events had scared the [LOC GOT.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Continuing the westward progression , [PER Mansouri  ] declared that [LOC Algeria  ] 's terror problem was returning , as [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] focused on [LOC North Africa  ] to offset reverses in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He said that even though senior [MISC Algerians  ] refuse to come to [LOC Rabat  ] , [MISC Moroccans  ] go there . 
[PER Mansouri  ] said that [LOC Morocco  ] has tried everything to improve bilateral relations . 
He noted that while counterterrorism cooperation must work , President [PER Abdelaziz Bouteflika  ] had recently completely rejected a [MISC Tunisian  ] initiative to organize a security summit of [ORG Arab Maghreb Union  ] ( [ORG AMU  ] ) members . 
[LOC WESTERN SAHARA  ] -------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Mansouri  ] told [PER Welch  ] and party that [LOC Algeria  ] 's internal problems did not prevent a solution to the [LOC Western Sahara  ] dispute . 
He expressed some concern that generational change in [LOC Algiers  ] might complicate a solution , declaring that the older generation had created the problem and was best placed to solve it . 
[PER Mansouri  ] said the [ORG GOM  ] is " very worried about the [ORG POLISARIO  ] moving into the area east of the berm . 
" Ambassador [PER Welch  ] then launched into a long discussion of [LOC U.S.  ] support for [LOC Morocco  ] , s autonomy proposal and for a diplomatic solution . 
Both he and Ambassador [PER Riley  ] cautioned against military action . 
[PER Welch  ] said that while nine UNSC members still do not back [LOC Morocco  ] 's position , international support was growing . 
[PER Mansouri  ] then explained that [ORG UN Special  ] Envoy [PER Peter Van Walsum  ] had expressed some disappointment with [LOC U.S.  ] and international support . 
[PER Welch  ] said we would look at ways to publicly support [PER Van Walsum  ] 's efforts to achieve a solution . 
He added that the [ORG POLISARIO  ] would never have an independent state . 
[LOC MAURITANIA  ] ---------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Last but not least , [PER Mansouri  ] expressed deep concern about the deteriorating security situation in [LOC Mauritania  ] and requested that the USG consider enhanced assistance to support the new democratic government . 
[PER Welch  ] said that the [LOC U.S.  ] is providing more assistance both through the [ORG Middle East Partnership Initiative  ] and the [ORG Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Partnership  ] . 
COMMENT RABAT 00000194 003 OF 003 ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Director General [PER Mansouri  ] , who is very close to King [PER Mohammed VI  ] , clearly enjoyed his three hours with Ambassador [PER Welch  ] and party .
