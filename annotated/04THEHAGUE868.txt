( S ) PolMilOff reviewed ref A demarche with [MISC Dutch  ] MFA Director for Arms Export Policy [PER Paul van den  ] [LOC IJssel  ] on April <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
Van den [LOC IJssel  ] stressed that the [MISC Dutch  ] were not among the leaders of the initiative to lift the [ORG EU  ] embargo . 
Nevertheless , he saw merit in the [LOC PRC  ] argument that [LOC China  ] differs from other countries that the [ORG EU  ] maintains arms embargoes against such as [LOC Burma  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] , with their human rights situations , or countries involved in international terrorism . 
Van den [LOC IJssel  ] said the [ORG GONL  ] agreed that [LOC China  ] 's human rights performance was far from ideal , and that it shared [LOC U.S.  ] concerns about possible buildup of [LOC China  ] 's military posture vis-a-vis [LOC Taiwan  ] . 
He again raised the [ORG EU  ] Code of Conduct ( refs B-D ) stressing that criteria five of the Code addressed avoiding arms transfers that might be used against friendly forces . 
He said that the [MISC Dutch  ] still hope that a number of [ORG EU  ] countries will support closely reviewing the Code to see how it could be helpful in the [LOC China  ] context. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Van den [LOC IJssel  ] said the [ORG GONL  ] faced competing pressures on this issue including a recent unanimous resolution in the [MISC Dutch  ] parliament against the lifting the embargo . 
On the other hand , he claimed the [LOC PRC  ] has threatened smaller [ORG EU  ] countries against blocking a consensus to lift . 
In this regard , he noted the [MISC Dutch  ] experience in the 1980s when the [LOC PRC  ] downgraded relations with the [LOC Netherlands  ] following the [MISC Dutch  ] sale of two diesel electric submarines to [LOC Taiwan  ] . 
Van den [LOC IJssel  ] said the [MISC Japanese  ] have also demarched the [ORG GONL  ] in opposition to lifting the embargo . 
He noted that PM Balkenende and [ORG FM Bot  ] will be traveling to [LOC China  ] on April 5-7 . 
Their briefing notes reiterate points made by [ORG FM Bot  ] to parliament in which he said that the [LOC Netherlands  ] would not be the only [ORG EU  ] country to block consensus on this issue . 
( S ) Comment: Van den [LOC IJssel  ] stressed that the [MISC Dutch  ] were in no hurry to see the embargo lifted . 
While he made clear the [ORG GONL  ] will not oppose a lift by itself , he expressed hope that other countries in the [ORG EU  ] might be inclined to go slow on the issue .
