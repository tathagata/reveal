( U ) This is an action request , please see paragaph five. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Embassy [LOC Brasilia  ] appreciates the opportunity to comment on the draft TVPRA list of products using child and/or forced labor . 
The draft list of [MISC Brazilian  ] products is only partially accurate and [ORG Mission  ] is concerned that this blunt instrument will not reflect the relative size of the problem and therefore may unfairly brand an entire product even when only a small percentage of production uses child and/or forced labor . 
Nor can it adequately reflect trends that are especially relevant to certain sensitive products such as ethanol derived from sugarcane ( ref D ) . 
We also share the concerns expressed by [ORG Buenos Aires  ] ( ref B ) and [LOC Bogota  ] ( ref C ) and would like to see more detailed information in the final list to give context about the size of the child and forced labor problems . 
It will also be important to distinguish between those countries in which governments are taking serious steps to correct child and forced labor problems and those where no such effort is being made. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Publication of the list can be expected to provoke a negative reaction from [MISC Brazilian  ] authorities who may suspect an underlying trade protection motive on our part . 
For this reason and in view of acute [MISC Brazilian  ] sensitivity to outside criticism , [ORG Mission  ] will need to brief [MISC Brazilian  ] officials on the final list before it is made public to mitigate the damage. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG Mission  ] has credible information that child and/or forced labor is used to produce the following: Beans ( soy ) [LOC Child Labor  ] and [LOC Forced Labor  ] Cattle [LOC Child Labor  ] and Forced Labor Ceramics Child Labor Charcoal [LOC Child Labor  ] and Forced Labor ( [LOC Note:  ] as it pertains to charcoal for the production of pig iron .

End note . 
) [ORG Mission  ] has credible information that child labor is also used in gold and tin mining and to harvest [LOC Brazil  ] nuts . 
We cannot confirm that child and/or forced labor is used to produce the following and will seek additional information: Bananas Child Labor Bricks [LOC Child Labor  ] Coffee Forced Labor ( [LOC Note:  ] an NGO expert on forced labor told us there are very few forced labor cases associated with coffee . 
End note .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) Action request: [ORG Mission  ] requests information from DOL about sources used to develop the list of [MISC Brazilian  ] products . 
[ORG Mission  ] will continue to research products on the list and will provide additional findings .
