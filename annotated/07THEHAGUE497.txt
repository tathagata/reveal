THE HAGUE 297 Classified By: AMBASSADOR ROLAND ARNALL , REASONS 1.4 ( B , D ) Assistant Secretary [PER Fried:  ] <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) My staff and I are happy to welcome you back to The [LOC Netherlands  ] March 22-23 . 
You will be the most senior [ORG Department of State  ] visitor here since the formation of the new , center-left coalition government ( [PER Balkenende IV  ] ) . 
While the coalition has survived its first major political test by winning a majority in this month 's Provincial elections ( ref a ) , it is clearly still finding its feet . 
So far , its agenda has been dominated by domestic politics -- including a troubling debate on the status of dual nationals -- but the new government will shortly have to make tough decisions on whether to extend the [MISC Dutch  ] deployment in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , how to move forward on [MISC European  ] integration , whether to continue to participate in the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] program , and other critical foreign policy and defense challenges . 
The next few months , therefore , will be crucial in setting the tone of our bilateral relationship for the next several years , as well as in determining whether this government can find a comfortable balance between its transatlantic and [MISC European  ] identities. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Your visit provides an excellent opportunity to get the relationship off on the right foot , and to help tee up the April visits to the [LOC U.S.  ] of Foreign Minister [PER Maxime Verhagen  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) and State Secretary ( equivalent to junior minister ) for Development [PER Bert Koenders  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) . 
As noted ref b , FM [PER Verhagen  ] 's instincts favor strengthening the bilateral relationship , even at the expense of [LOC Europe  ] , if necessary . 
He is already facing strong pressure from within the coalition -- and even some factions of his own party -- to show his independence by pressing the [LOC U.S.  ] on issues like renditions and [LOC Guantanamo  ] , however . 
[PER Koenders  ] , on the other hand , comes to the relationship with a history of challenging the former government 's pro-American tilt despite his long association with [ORG NATO  ] ( i.e. , [PER Koenders  ] was elected chairman of the [ORG NATO  ] Parliamentary Assembly just prior to joining the government ) and a reputation for being among the most transatlantic members of his [ORG Labor Party  ] . 
Both ministers will play key roles in guiding the Cabinet 's decision making on [LOC Afghanistan  ] in coming months -- which is why both of them , along with Defense Minister [PER van Middelkoop  ] , are currently visiting [MISC Uruzgan  ] to review the situation on the ground first hand. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Unfortunately , [PER Verhagen  ] and [PER Koenders  ] will be tied up on Thursday and Friday with formal commemorations of the anniversary of the [ORG Rome Treaty  ] ( presided over by Queen [PER Beatrix  ] ) and the weekly cabinet meeting with the Prime Minister , so it will not be possible to meet with them personally on this visit . 
On Thursday , however , you will be able to discuss the agenda for the upcoming visit and other substantive issues with Deputy Political Director ( and former [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG DCM  ] in [LOC Washington  ] ) [PER Wim Geerts  ] . 
Later that evening , you will be the guest of honor at a dinner attended by senior [ORG MFA  ] officials ( including Political Director [PER Pieter de Gooijer  ] ) , parliamentarians , and other notables ( including former Prime Minister [PER Ruud Lubbers  ] and former Foreign Minister [PER Ben Bot  ] . 
) We expect the informal dinner format , in particular , will lend itself to a lively debate on the future of [MISC U.S.-Dutch-European  ] relations with a well-informed , highly influential audience of prominent public figures. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) We are also very pleased that you have agreed to address the inaugural event of the [ORG Netherlands-Atlantic Youth Association  ] on Thursday afternoon at [ORG Leiden University  ] . 
This group was founded recently , with Embassy encouragement , to introduce the next generation of [MISC Dutch  ] leaders to the benefits of the transatlantic relationship . 
Your participation in this event will help get this ambitious project off to a strong start , while reinforcing this mission 's efforts to reach out to [MISC Dutch  ] youth . 
We are working to ensure that this event receives press coverage , and that you will have an opportunity to address the press directly on the same themes on the margins of the actual event. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Finally , on Friday morning you will have the chance to discuss issues of concern to the [MISC Dutch Muslim  ] community over breakfast , following up on the successful visit last week by [PER Nerissa Cook  ] 's delegation on Integration and Radicalization . 
During that visit , government officials and representatives of the [MISC Dutch Muslim  ] community expressed concern that USG initiatives to engage [MISC European  ] [MISC Muslims  ] could be perceived as linking the bulk of the [MISC European  ] [MISC Muslim  ] population to violent extremist movements . 
While recognizing the [LOC United States'  ] legitimate interest in countering extremism and potential terrorist threats , they cautioned against appearing to associate the integration of [MISC European  ] [MISC Muslims  ] primarily with efforts to counter radicalization . 
In this context , some cited your recent [ORG Washington Times  ] interview as evidence that the [LOC U.S.  ] sees [MISC European  ] [MISC Muslims  ] as a collective problem rather than as individuals worthy of dialogue ; your visit will provide the perfect opportunity to set the record straight .
