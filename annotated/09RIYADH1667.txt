RIYADH 1633 RIYADH 00001667 001.2 OF 003 Classified By: A/DCM [PER Lisa Carle  ] , 1.4 ( A ) , ( B ) AND ( D ) SUMMARY -------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Assistant Minister of [ORG Defense Prince Khalid  ] bin [PER Sultan  ] announced in a new conference yesterday ( Dec. 22 ) that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] 's main military operations in the [MISC Yemeni  ] border area had ceased , that the [MISC Saudi  ] military had full control of the border area , and that military activity was now focused on expelling remaining intruders . 
His statement is the first official indication that the fighting might be winding down ; senior Embassy contacts in the [MISC Saudi  ] [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] as recently as yesterday were stressing the ongoing urgency of resupplying aircraft munitions . 
[PER Prince Khalid  ] also gave the first official accounting of [MISC Saudi  ] casualties since early [MISC November:  ] 73 dead , 470 wounded , and 26 missing . 
End Summary . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] Declares Victory -------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) During a tour of the [MISC Saudi-Yemeni  ] border area yesterday [PER Prince Khaled Bin Sultan  ] , Assistant Minister of [ORG Defense and Aviation  ] , announced to local reporters that the [MISC Saudi  ] military was now in full control of the border area and that its main operations had ended . 
" What we are doing now is bringing things to normal , " he said , and that [MISC Saudi  ] forces would remain in the area with a mission of removing any remaining " infiltrators . 
" [PER Prince Khalid  ] also provided the first official accounting of [MISC Saudi  ] casualties since early [MISC November:  ] 73 dead , 470 wounded , and 26 missing . 
The Embassy has been hearing rumors circulating over the past two weeks that [PER King Abdullah  ] was increasingly upset that the military campaign had not been wrapped up . 
Thus political pressure may have been a factor in the timing of [PER Prince Khalid  ] 's announcement , but given the gravity and urgency with which the [MISC Saudis  ] viewed the challenge from the [LOC Houthis  ] , [PER Prince Khalid  ] 's announcement suggests that the [MISC Saudi  ] leadership is now convinced that sufficient punishment had been inflicted upon the [LOC Houthis  ] to have taught them a lesson and to put an end to their border harrassments . 
Is it Really Over ? -------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The Embassy [ORG DAO  ] was told by senior [MISC Saudi  ] [ORG Air Force  ] officers on December 22 that [MISC Saudi  ] fighter aircraft had continued to launch attack against [MISC Houthi  ] targets in recent days , sustaining the high tempo that started in the second week of November . 
[MISC Saudi  ] television was airing footage as recently as December 21 showing [MISC Saudi  ] tanks and artillery firing in the border area , and [MISC Saudi  ] soldiers launching mortars and firing machine guns . 
A digest of other key press reports from recent days is below: -- ( [ORG U  ] ) Military Successes: [MISC Saudi  ] media continue to report victories , describing in general terms how [MISC Saudi  ] forces were &repelling attacks8 or &pursuing infiltrators and inflicting heavy losses.8 The Dec. 21 [ORG Saudi Gazette  ] headline boasted of 30 infiltrators killed . 
Al-Sharq al-Awsat quoted a military source on Dec. 21 saying that [MISC Saudi  ] forces successfully destroyed a series of caves that the infiltrators were using to store weapons and ammunition , but could comment no further than to say that combing operations continue on the ground while [MISC F-15  ] and [ORG Apache  ] aircraft continue air raids. -- ( [ORG U  ] ) Religious Support for [MISC Saudi  ] Forces: [ORG Saudi Press Agency  ] ) 12/18/09: The [MISC Grand Mufti  ] , Sheikh [PER Abulaziz Al-Sheikh  ] , addressed [MISC Saudi  ] forces saying , &Mujahedeen Brothers , I salute your courage ( and congratulate you on your Jihad for the sake of [LOC Allah  ] . 
You are facing a corrupt RIYADH 00001667 002.2 OF 003 and astray enemy of deviant thoughts.8 The [MISC Mufti  ] went on to say that the actions of the armed forces are the highest deeds of [MISC Islam  ] . 
( Comment: This statement of support by the [ORG KSA  ] , s highest religious authority seeks to reinforce the message that the truest form of jihad is fighting to defend the nation , and to remind that those who seek to bring the nation down are deviant in their thoughts . 
End Comment . 
) -- ( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Border Security: Arab News Online  ] ) 12/16/09: Normalcy Restored at [LOC Border  ] , The [MISC Saudi  ] military announced that 127,875 infiltrators and 2,206 smugglers have been arrested over the past six months on the [MISC Saudi-Yemeni  ] border. &Saudi forces also seized a number of weapons and 14,000 rounds of ammunition . 
Forces foiled attempts to smuggle 30kg of gunpowder and explosives , eight sticks of dynamite and large quantities of narcotic substances in 2,140 cars.8 ( COMMENT: The six month time period and large number of &infiltrators8 arrested make these statistics appear more closely related to routine border patrol operations than directly with the fight against the [LOC Houthis  ] . 
This announcement seems intended to show strong [MISC Saudi  ] control over the border , rather than make a statement about fighting infiltrators. , End comment . 
) -- ( [LOC S/NF  ] ) Report from the [ORG Houthi Side: Al-Minbar  ] ( pro-Houthi website ) and other [MISC Houthi  ] sources over the past week continued to claim that [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Saudi  ] aircraft were conducting airstrikes on innocent villages . 
[MISC Houthi  ] sources report 54 [MISC Yemeni  ] deaths from a Dec. 20 [MISC Saudi  ] air attack and 70 deaths from an attack on Dec. 13 . 
These reports could not be verified ; [MISC Yemeni  ] officials continue to deny that any [MISC Saudi  ] planes have strayed into [MISC Yemeni  ] airspace . 
( Comment: a senior [MISC Saudi  ] [ORG Air Force  ] officer confirmed to the Embassy [ORG DAO  ] that [MISC Saudi  ] aircraft have been operating in northern [LOC Yemen  ] with the [MISC Yemeni  ] government 's approval and facilitation . 
) ( [ORG U  ] ) On Dec. 18 , [ORG Al-Minbar  ] claimed another successful [MISC Houthi  ] attack on a [MISC Saudi  ] military post in [LOC Quwwa  ] village &expelling the [MISC Saudi  ] Army and seizing its military equipment , communication and surveillance devices and military vehicles that soldiers left behind.8 The statement on [ORG Al-Minbar  ] went on to justify the [MISC Houthi  ] attack against the [MISC Saudi  ] forces , explaining &We do not aim to take control over any part of the [MISC Saudi  ] territories . 
However , we are forced to chase the aggressor wherever it carries out attacks against us . 
This comes in retaliation for its continuous aggression against civilians in the northern governorates.8 Iran: Still the [MISC Bogeyman  ] ? -------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The tacit cease-fire in the [MISC Saudi-Iranian  ] war of words over the [LOC Yemen  ] border war seems to be holding . 
The Embassy saw unofficial reports on the internet earlier this week that [MISC Iranian  ] Parliament Speaker [PER Larijani  ] might visit [LOC Riyadh  ] today ( The [MISC Embassy  ] has not been able to confirm these reports . 
) Nonetheless , senior [MISC Saudi  ] military and civilian officials seem to uniformly share the conviction that [LOC Iran  ] 's machinations are the only plausible explanation for why the [LOC Houthis  ] would have engaged in a fight with the [MISC Saudis  ] that they were bound to lose . 
[MISC Saudi  ] military officials also point to the improved training and battle tactics of the [MISC Houthi  ] , their deep reserves of weaponry , and several large stores of money discovered in [MISC Houthi  ] areas as further compelling evidence of [LOC Iran  ] 's active support . 
What 's Next ---------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The days ahead should tell whether there is a significant stand down in [MISC Saudi  ] military operations . 
Our assessment is that the [MISC Saudi  ] Land Forces have largely established secure positions along the troubled area of the [MISC Saudi-Yemeni  ] border and that their shooting engagements have for the most part trailed off into patrolling and monitoring operations . 
[MISC Saudi  ] air operations to patrol the border and strike [MISC Houthi  ] targets near the border and into [LOC Yemen  ] will likely continue for days or perhaps weeks , until the [MISC Saudis  ] are comfortable that [MISC Yemeni  ] government forces have the capability to suppress any [MISC Houthi  ] activity near the border . 
RIYADH 00001667 003.2 OF 003 Lessons from the [LOC Battlefield  ] ----------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The last 50 days of [MISC Saudi-Houthi  ] fighting have arguably been the most significant [MISC Saudi  ] military engagements since the tribal battles that [LOC Abdulaziz  ] that fought to establish the [MISC Saudi  ] kingdom . 
The [MISC Houthi  ] battles will be intensively studied in the months ahead , including how they revealed [MISC Saudi  ] military shortcomings . 
The [MISC Saudi  ] military , particularly the [ORG Air Force  ] , resorted to the use of enormous firepower ( despite low munitions inventories ) that proved to be inadequately precise and minimally effective against fighters maneuvering and dug into rugged mountain terrain . 
Among questions that merit attention will be to what extent should the [MISC Saudi  ] military restructure itself to respond to such asymmetrical threats , why the [MISC Saudis  ] responded to the [MISC Houthi  ] challenge as such an urgent existential threat , and whether the perceived inability or unwillingness of the [LOC U.S.  ] to more rapidly provide emergency munitions resupply to the [MISC Saudis  ] in their perceived hour of need will ramifications for our military to military partnership . 
These and related issues will be the focus of forthcoming [MISC Embassy  ] analyses .
