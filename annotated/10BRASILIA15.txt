( C ) SUMMARY . 
The [ORG Government of Brazil  ] ( [ORG GOB  ] ) will inscribe the mitigation actions it previously announced under the [LOC Copenhagen  ] [MISC Accord  ] by January 31 , 2010 , according to both [ORG Ministry of External Relations'  ] Under Secretary for Policy [PER Vera Machado  ] and Vice Minister of the [ORG Environment Izabella Teixeira  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] brought to the Conference of the [MISC Parties-15  ] ( [MISC COP-15  ] ) to the [ORG UN Framework Convention  ] on [ORG Climate Change  ] ( [ORG UNFCCC  ] ) in [LOC Copenhagen  ] its voluntary national goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 36.1 percent to 38.9 percent by 2020 compared with " business as usual " . 
Subsequently , on December 29 , 2009 , [LOC Brazil  ] enacted legislation codifying this voluntary national goal . 
Further , Environment Minister [PER Carlos Minc  ] will lead the [MISC Brazilian  ] delegation to the upcoming meeting in [LOC New Delhi  ] of the [ORG BASIC  ] group ( [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC South Africa  ] , [LOC India  ] and [LOC China  ] ) . 
[PER Machado  ] and [PER Teixeira  ] were vague about what they expected to happen there , except to say the [ORG BASIC  ] group would discuss next steps after [MISC COP-15  ] . 
Both [PER Machado  ] and [PER Teixeira  ] expressed uncertainty about what [LOC China  ] would do about the [LOC Copenhagen  ] [MISC Accord  ] . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Per reftel , Charge d'Affaires , a.i . 
[PER Lisa Kubiske  ] met on January 20 with the [ORG Ministry of External Relations'  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) Under Secretary for Policy [PER Vera Machado  ] and subsequently with Vice Minister of the [ORG Environment Izabella Teixeira  ] to encourage the [ORG Government of Brazil  ] ( [ORG GOB  ] ) to inscribe its mitigation actions under the [LOC Copenhagen  ] [MISC Accord  ] by January 31 . 
[PER Machado  ] said that there would be " no problem , no delay " with the [ORG GOB  ] inscribing its previously announced voluntary national goal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions . 
She explained that the [ORG MRE  ] was concluding the interministerial procedures necessary for the [ORG GOB  ] to inscribe its goal. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) While the [ORG GOB  ] will inscribe its voluntary national goal , it is not giving the [LOC Copenhagen  ] [MISC Accord  ] a full embrace . 
[PER Machado  ] said , " We are not signing up , we are informing what our national commitments are . 
" [PER Fernando Lyrio  ] , who is the [ORG Environment Ministry  ] 's [ORG International Advisor  ] and who accompanied [PER Teixeira  ] in the meeting , said that there was no mandate out of [MISC COP-15  ] . 
He added that the [LOC Copenhagen  ] [MISC Accord  ] is an informal one . 
WHAT [LOC BRAZIL  ] WILL INSCRIBE <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) The [ORG GOB  ] plans to inscribe its voluntary national goal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 36.1 percent to 38.9 percent by 2020 compared with " business as usual " ( [ORG BAU  ] ) emissions . 
[PER Dilma Rousseff  ] , the head of the Presidency ( [LOC Casa Civil  ] ) , had announced this voluntary national goal on December 15 in [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
She identified the nationally appropriate mitigation actions ( NAMAs ) that [LOC Brazil  ] intended to take to achieve this goal: NAMAs 2020 PROJECTED REDUCTIONS vs. [ORG BAU  ] ( in millions of tons of CO2 equivalents ) Reducing Deforestation Rate 669 ( 24.7% ) 1,084 -Amazon Biome by 80% ( 564 ) -Cerrado Biome by 40% ( 104 ) Agriculture Practices 133 to 166 ( 4.9-6.1% ) 627 -Recuperation of Pastures ( 83 to 104 ) -Integrated Farming-Ranching ( 18 to 22 ) -Direct " No Till " Planting ( 16 to 20 ) -Biological [PER Nitrogen  ] Fixing ( 16 to 20 ) Energy Measures 166 to 207 ( 6.1-7.7% ) 901 -Energy Efficiency ( 12 to 15 ) -Increased Biofuels Use ( 48 to 60 ) -More [ORG Hydroelectric Power  ] ( 79 to 99 ) -Alternative Sources of Energy ( Bioelectricity , Wind , etc . 
) ( 26 to 33 ) Other Measures 8 to 10 ( 0.3-0.4% ) 92 -Use of [LOC Sustainable Charcoal  ] in Pig [ORG Iron/Steel Sector  ] ( 8 to 10 ) TOTAL 975 to 1,052 ( 36.1-38.9% ) 2,703 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) On December 29 , 2009 , President [PER Luis Inacio Lula da Silva  ] signed Law 12.187/2009 that converted the [ORG National Climate Change Policy  ] into law . 
Importantly , [ORG Article  ] 12 of that law incorporated the voluntary national goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions through mitigation actions by 36.1 percent to 38.9 percent by 2020 compared with " business as usual " emissions . 
[PER Teixeira  ] said that the [ORG GOB  ] was working out the details for implementing these NAMAs . 
In particular , the [ORG GOB  ] was developing its first ever plan to combat deforestation in the savannah region ( [LOC Cerrado  ] ) , which constitutes the second biggest [ORG NAMA  ] after reducing [MISC Amazon  ] deforestation . 
These details should be unveiled in March as part of the newest version of the [ORG National Climate Change Plan  ] . 
INFLUENCING OTHERS TO ASSOCIATE AND INSCRIBE <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The Charge encouraged the [ORG GOB  ] to urge other countries to associate with the [LOC Copenhagen  ] [MISC Accord  ] and , with respect to the other members of the [ORG BASIC  ] ( [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC South Africa  ] , [LOC India  ] and [LOC China  ] ) group , to inscribe their mitigation actions . 
She pointed out that countries , such as [LOC Guatemala  ] , might be amenable to leadership by [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[PER Machado  ] offered a tepid , non-committal response . 
As for [LOC Brazil  ] being able to influence [LOC China  ] within the [ORG BASIC  ] group , [PER Machado  ] laughed at the idea . 
UPCOMING [ORG BASIC  ] MEETING <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Both [PER Machado  ] and [PER Teixeira  ] were vague about what they expected out of the January 24 meeting of the [ORG BASIC  ] group in [LOC New Delhi  ] . 
They both reflected great pride on the central role the [ORG BASIC  ] group played at [MISC COP-15  ] . 
They saw the upcoming meeting as an opportunity for [ORG BASIC  ] to set the path for where the climate change negotiations will go this year . 
[PER Machado  ] and [PER Teixeira  ] were uncertain about what [LOC China  ] will do now. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Environment Minister [PER Carlos Minc  ] will lead the [MISC Brazilian  ] delegation to the [LOC New Delhi  ] meeting of the [ORG BASIC  ] group , and [ORG MRE  ] 's Director of the [ORG Environment Department  ] , [ORG Amb  ] . 
[PER Luis Figueiredo Machado  ] , will accompany him . 
( COMMENT . 
Having [PER Minc  ] lead the [MISC Brazilian  ] delegation is probably a good development . 
He has been the most vocal member of [LOC Brazil  ] 's climate change team for large emerging countries to take more active measures to address climate change . 
He is more likely to push back if other [ORG BASIC  ] countries seek to step backwards from what they committed to do in [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
END COMMENT .
