End summary . 
Lessons of May 22 Counter-Attack -------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) During a brief stopover in [LOC Nairobi  ] May 28 while en route to [LOC Libya  ] , a relaxed [ORG TFG  ] Prime Minister [PER Omar Sharmarke  ] told [LOC Somalia  ] Unit officers that his government 's troops had fared well in the initial stages of their counterattack against insurgents in [LOC Mogadishu  ] on May 22 . 
After taking significant parts of [LOC Mogadishu  ] ( reftel ) , [ORG TFG  ] troops had been forced to retreat , however , when its [ORG Uganda-trained  ] contingent found itself near the Industrial Road area and far in advance of other [ORG TFG  ] units . 
Inaccurate information passed by cellphone , the troops' only means of communication , caused the [ORG Uganda-trained  ] soldiers to believe they had been cut off from other [ORG TFG  ] soldiers , and they beat a hasty retreat , [PER Sharmarke  ] said . 
The May 22 counteroffensive , although ultimately unsuccessful , showed that security force their considerable weaknesses: communications , logistics , and battlefield command . 
[PER Sharmarke  ] requested [ORG USG  ] assistance in procuring walkie talkies and other battlefield communications equipment and any training that could be provided the [ORG TFG  ] 's field commanders . 
He welcome the suggestion that experienced [MISC Rwandan  ] or [MISC Ugandan  ] trainers be detailed , if possible , to [LOC Mogadishu  ] to lead intensive courses . 
Praise for [ORG IGAD  ] Communique -------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Sharmarke  ] was philosophical about progress al-Shabaab and other insurgents had made against the [ORG TFG  ] in recent weeks . 
The [ORG TFG  ] , he maintained , was keeping the door open to " reasonable guys , " while al-Shabaab 's reliance on foreigners was costing it support among [MISC Somalis  ] . 
[PER Sharmarke  ] praised the May 20 [ORG IGAD  ] ministerial communique 's call for control of [MISC Somali  ] airports and ports , and alleged that it had triggered al-Shabaab 's efforts , via incursions into [LOC Medina  ] to win control of [LOC Mogadishu  ] airport . 
Foreigners Fighting ------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Sharmarke  ] joined other [MISC Somalis  ] in alleging significant foreign involvement in al-Shabaab 's efforts . 
A " [MISC Pakistani  ] general " was coordinating the attacks on the [ORG TFG  ] in [LOC Mogadishu  ] , he said . 
Also present was an alleged al-Qaida operative he was able to identify only as " al-Libi . 
" [PER Sharmarke  ] noted that he was keeping indirect tabs on [PER Muhtar Robow  ] , but no one in the [ORG TFG  ] , to his knowledge , had had contact since [PER Robow  ] 's resignation as al-Shabaab spokesman . 
[PER Sharmarke  ] described considerable stress between Hisbul [MISC Islam  ] and al-Shabaab , with [PER Hassan Dahir  ] Aweys allegedly " shocked " by al-Shabaab 's " lack of a strategy other than fighting . 
" [ORG ASWJ  ] Negotiations Faltering --------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG TFG  ] 's negotiations with [ORG Ahlu Sunnah Wal Jama'a  ] ( [ORG ASWJ  ] ) had produced no results to date , according to [PER Sharmarke  ] . 
He described the [LOC Somalia  ] central region [LOC NAIROBI  ] 00001057 002 OF 002 representatives they had been in contact with as " determined to make gains quickly on the ground , " so that those gains could be parlayed into an improved negotiating position with the [ORG TFG  ] . 
Although the [ORG TFG  ] had provided some money to [ORG ASWJ  ] , all assistance was now stalled , with some in the [ORG TFG  ] worried that [ORG TFG  ] cash was feeding a potential rival . 
[ORG ASWJ  ] continued to push for high-profile ministerial positions and to stall on active cooperation with the [ORG TFG  ] . 
[PER Sharmarke  ] was not certain what pressure the Government of [LOC Ethiopia  ] could exert on [ORG ASWJ  ] , but he several times urged the [ORG USG  ] to do what it could to bring [ORG ASWJ  ] around . 
Money Needs ----------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The Prime Minister promised an accounting shortly of the [ORG USD  ] 500 thousand provided by the [ORG USG  ] . 
He as very grateful for [ORG USG  ] efforts to supply [ORG TFG  ] forces with larger-caliber ammunition and weapons . 
The [ORG TFG  ] had subsidized allies in [LOC Hiraan  ] and [LOC Jowhar  ] , as well as having provided stipends to an unspecified number of " al-Shabaab defectors . 
" His government believed it was safer if the technicals that belonged to mercurial warlords [PER Mohammed Dheere  ] and [PER Indha Adde  ] were safely in [ORG TFG  ] control , and negotiations were now under way to that end . 
[PER Sharmarke  ] estimated the total number of technicals at 18 , in addition to one [ORG APC  ] . 
He noted that their purchase would place significant additional strain on the [ORG TFG  ] 's finances and asked continued [ORG USG  ] support . 
( In a subsequent brief conversation with [MISC UNPOS  ] Deputy [PER Charles Petrie  ] , [PER Sharmarke  ] urged [ORG UN  ] and [ORG USG  ] intercession with [LOC Iraq  ] to speed the delivery of an alleged [ORG USD  ] 5 million that the [LOC Baghdad  ] government had pledged to the [ORG TFG  ] . 
) Support for [MISC Kinetic Strikes  ] --------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Sharmarke  ] recalled that he had called [LOC Somalia  ] Unit on May 16 to urge that the [ORG USG  ] " take out " if possible participants in an al-Shabaab - Hisbul [MISC Islam  ] conclave near Afgoye . 
That phone call , he re-affirmed , had been made with the express consent of President [PER Sheikh Sharif  ] , who also believed with [PER Sharmarke  ] that and [ORG USG  ] strikes on known terrorists or their training camps was necessary . 
Asked if the [ORG TFG  ] could weather the fallout from such a strike or strikes and their potential collateral damage [PER Sharmarke  ] , without hesitation said , " yes . 
" " These people , " he said , " are out to destroy our way of life . 
" [ORG Travel Plans  ] ------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Sharmarke  ] was en route to [LOC Libya  ] at the invitation of [PER Qadhafi  ] and in place of President [PER Sharif  ] , whom Ambassador [PER Ranneberger  ] , in a May 26 telephone call , had strongly discouraged from leaving [LOC Mogadishu  ] during this stressful time . 
Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Sharmarke  ] , like President [PER Sharif  ] in our recent telephone contacts with him , was calm and convinced that the [ORG TFG  ] could prevail against its enemies . 
He philosophically acknowledged the many basic problems confronting his government , from forging an alliance with [ORG ASWJ  ] to ironing out command and control and logistical problems in its fragile security forces . 
His dismissive comments about al-Shabaab 's reported increasing reliance on foreign fighters , ironically , mirror al-Shabaab 's accusations that the [ORG TFG  ] is over-reliant on the foreign fighters of [ORG AMISOM  ] as it haltingly tries to increase its hold on [LOC Mogadishu  ] .
