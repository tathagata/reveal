( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: [LOC Iceland  ] 's Ministry for [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] remains noncommittal on [LOC Iceland  ] 's involvement in the [ORG OECD Partnership for Democratic Governance  ] ( [ORG PDG  ] ) , despite repeated overtures from Post . 
Embassy believes this may be a result of uncertainty about the form and objectives of the [ORG PDG  ] as well as the fact that [LOC Iceland  ] 's development aid policy is apparently under review by the Minister for [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] . 
Post suggests engagement on the margins of [ORG UNGA  ] to clarify details of the [ORG PDG  ] and press for [MISC Icelandic  ] support . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) DCM , Econ Chief , and visiting EUR/NB Desk Officer presented Ref A points to the Director-General for [ORG External Trade and Economic Affairs  ] at [LOC Iceland  ] 's Ministry for [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] on August 21 . 
Earlier in the day , Pol Chief , EUR/NB DeskOff and Pol Intern made a similar presentation to the [ORG MFA  ] 's Counsellor for [ORG Human Rights and Democracy Issues  ] . 
Both were appreciative but noncommittal , saying they would raise the issue within the ministry . 
In follow-up contacts on September 14 and again on September 20 to present Ref B information , [ORG MFA  ] contacts were similarly undecided about [LOC Iceland  ] 's participation . 
[MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG MFA  ] 's Minister-Counsellor for [ORG International Organization Affairs  ] [PER Nikulas Hannigan  ] told Pol Chief on September 20 that the issue was " under review " at the ministry , but added on a separate topic that development aid was one of [LOC Iceland  ] 's main issues of interest for the upcoming [ORG UN General Assembly  ] ( [ORG UNGA  ] ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: EmbOffs have learned separately that Minister for [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] Gisladottir has asked for a review of [LOC Iceland  ] 's development aid policy , including an exploration of merging the [ORG Icelandic International Development Agency  ] ( [ORG ICEIDA  ] ) into the Ministry . 
Currently , [ORG ICEIDA  ] handles bilateral aid projects while the [ORG MFA  ] has responsibility for multilateral donations . 
We speculate that this review may be stalling commitments to other initiatives. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment , cont 'd : Post recommends engagement with the [MISC Icelandic  ] missions at the [ORG UN  ] and [ORG OECD  ] to clarify thinking on the [ORG PDG  ] as well as direct engagement with the [MISC Icelandic  ] delegation at [ORG UNGA  ] to help flush out [ORG MFA  ] thinking on the issue .
