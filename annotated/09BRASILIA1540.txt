( U ) The [MISC Brazilian  ] government continues to cooperate in countering terrorism and related activities that could contribute to the facilitation of attacks in the region or elsewhere-to include investigating potential terrorism financing , document forgery networks , and other illicit activity . 
Operationally , elements of the [MISC Brazilian  ] government responsible for combating terrorism , such as the [ORG Federal Police  ] , Customs , and the [ORG Brazilian Intelligence Agency  ] , work effectively with their [LOC U.S.  ] counterparts most of the time and pursue investigative leads provided by [LOC U.S.  ] and other intelligence services , law enforcement , and financial agencies regarding terrorist suspects. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) There are two separate discourses in the government of [LOC Brazil  ] on counterterrorism ; politically , [LOC Brazil  ] continues to deny the presence and potential threat of terrorists and terrorism in [LOC Brazil  ] , while law enforcement and intelligence monitor and cooperate to counter the threat . 
The head of the [ORG Brazilian Federal Police  ] ( [ORG DPF  ] ) intelligence division in July went on record during a [MISC Brazilian  ] Chamber of Deputies hearing on terrorism and admitted that an individual arrested in April was in fact linked to al [PER Qaeda  ] ( AQ ) . 
Despite the statement , most GOB officials continue to toe the party line and deny any evidence that terrorists have , or would be , interested in establishing a presence in [LOC Brazil.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's intelligence and law enforcement services are concerned that terrorists could exploit [MISC Brazilian  ] territory to support and facilitate terrorist attacks , whether domestically or abroad , and have focused their efforts in the areas of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , the tri-borders areas of [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Argentina  ] , and [LOC Paraguay  ] ; [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Peru  ] , and [LOC Colombia  ] ; and the [MISC Colombian  ] and [MISC Venezuelan  ] borders . 
Other branches of the [MISC Brazilian  ] government , particularly the [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] , do not believe [LOC Brazil  ] is vulnerable to terrorism-related activities and instead focus more heavily on threats from transnational crimes . 
In October 2009 , the MRE did admit , for the first time , that terrorists could become interested in [LOC Brazil  ] because of the award of the 2016 [MISC Olympics  ] to [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] law enforcement 's recognition of the potential threat from terrorism prompted a reform of the [ORG Brazilian Intelligence Agency  ] ( [ORG ABIN  ] ) that could raise the profile of the issue by upgrading the counterterrorism division to the department level. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's intelligence and law enforcement forces work with regional and international partners . 
[LOC Brazil  ] participates in regional counterterrorism fora , but is less committed to regional groups in which the [LOC Unites States  ] is involved . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is actively involved [ORG Mercosul  ] 's working group on terrorism and the sub-working group on financial issues , the latter of which discusses terrorism financing and money laundering among the [ORG Mercosul  ] countries , but has proven difficult to engage in 3+1 mechanism on security in the [LOC Tri-Border Area  ] ( [ORG TBA  ] ) , where [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Argentina  ] and [LOC Paraguay  ] share a border. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Bilaterally , the [ORG USG  ] provided a variety of training courses throughout [LOC Brazil  ] in counterterrorism , combating money laundering , detection of travel document fraud , container security , and international organized crime . 
In 2009 the [ORG USG  ] again hosted a [MISC Major Crimes Conference  ] that successfully brought together [LOC Brazil  ] and neighboring countries' federal and state law enforcement communities and judges and prosecutors to share best practices and receive practical training. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) Although [LOC Brazil  ] has no official list of terrorist groups and does not recognize the [ORG FARC  ] as one , President [PER Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  ] has been critical of the [ORG FARC  ] 's use of violence and has publicly called on the group to desist in the armed struggle against the [MISC Colombian  ] government. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) [LOC Brazil  ] is capable of monitoring domestic financial operations and effectively utilizes its financial intelligence unit , the [ORG Financial Activities Oversight Council  ] ( [ORG COAF  ] ) , to identify possible funding sources for terrorist groups . 
Through [ORG COAF  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] has carried out name checks for persons and entities on the [ORG UNSCR  ] 1267 and 1373 terror finance lists , but has so far not found any assets , accounts or property in the names of persons or entities on the [ORG UN  ] terror-finance lists. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) [LOC Brazil  ] also continues to undertake steps to enhance its capabilities to combat money laundering . 
Since 2003 , fifteen specialized money laundering courts have been established , including two in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , with each court headed by a judge who receives specialized training in national money laundering legislation . 
In addition , in 2008 , the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] established a working group with money laundering judges to share best practices and training needs. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) A 2006 national anti-money laundering strategy goal was formed aimed to build on the success of the specialized courts by creating complementary specialized federal police financial crimes units in the same jurisdictions . 
In 2008 , the federal police established such units in the [ORG Federal District  ] ( [LOC Brasilia  ] ) and the states of [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] and [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
In addition , the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] funded the creation of technology center to combat money laundering in the federal district and [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] , the latter of which received two such centers , one embedded with the [ORG Public Ministry  ] and one with the [ORG State Civil Police  ] . 
In 2008 , the [ORG Ministry signed  ] accords to establish additional centers in [LOC Bahia  ] , [LOC Goiais  ] , and [LOC Rio Grande  ] do [LOC Sul.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The government of [LOC Brazil  ] 's counterterrorism strategy consists of deterring terrorists from using [MISC Brazilian  ] territory to facilitate attacks or raise funds , along with monitoring and suppressing transnational criminal activities that could support terrorist actions . 
It accomplishes this through actions between its law enforcement entities and through cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] and other partners in the region . 
For example , in 2009 [MISC Brazilian  ] authorities began in earnest to work with other concerned nations ( particularly the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) in combating the significant and largely unchecked document fraud problem in the country . 
During the year , multiple regional and international joint operations with [LOC U.S.  ] authorities successfully disrupted a number of document vendors and facilitators , as well as related human-trafficking infrastructures . 
This included one of the largest visa fraud cases of its type in [LOC U.S.  ] law enforcement history. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In 2009 , the work on the [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] container security initiative in [LOC Santos  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] was stalled after [LOC U.S.  ] officials traveling to [LOC Brazil  ] for the program had difficulties getting [MISC Brazilian  ] visas . 
The container security initiative was created to promote secure containerized cargo to the [LOC United States  ] through the establishment of a trade transparency unit to detect money laundering through trade transactions . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] ( MRE ) was uncomfortable with the counter-terrorism focus of the program , but has recently agreed to issuing visas in support of the initiative. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) The [MISC Brazilian  ] government is achieving visible results from recent investment in border and law enforcement infrastructure that were executed with a view to gradually control the flow of goods-legal and illegal-through the [LOC Tri-Border Area  ] ( [ORG TBA  ] ) of [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Argentina  ] , and [LOC Paraguay  ] , the proceeds of which could be diverted to support terror groups . 
The inspection station at the [LOC Friendship Bridge  ] in the [ORG TBA  ] that was completed by the [MISC Brazilian  ] customs agency ( [ORG Receita Federal  ] ) in 2007 continued to take effective action to reduce the smuggling of drugs , weapons , and contraband goods along the border with [LOC Paraguay  ] . 
According to [ORG Receita Federal  ] , from January to July 2009 the agency seized more than USD 400 million in contraband goods , including drugs , weapons , and munitions , an increase of eight percent from 2007 . 
As a result of the effective crackdown on the [LOC Friendship Bridge  ] , most smuggling operations now take place through the [LOC Parana River  ] and [LOC Lago Itaipu  ] and some have migrated to other sections of the border , such as the towns of [LOC Guiara  ] and [LOC Ponta Pora  ] . 
The [ORG Federal Police  ] has special maritime police units in both [MISC Foz  ] de [MISC Iguacu  ] and [LOC Guaira  ] that patrol the maritime border areas , but because of the scale and complexity of the endeavor to curtail smuggling and trafficking activities through the waterways , [LOC Brazil  ] is considering using an unmanned aerial vehicle to assist law enforcement in monitoring the border , a development that could further improve border security. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's overall commitment to combating terrorism and illicit activities that could be exploited to facilitate terrorism is undermined by the [ORG GOB  ] 's failure to strengthen its legal counterterrorism framework significantly . 
Although terrorist financing is an established predicate offense for money laundering , [LOC Brazil  ] lacks legislation criminalizing terrorism or its financing as autonomous offenses . 
The 2005 [ORG National Strategy against Money Laundering  ] ( [ORG ENCLA  ] ) created a working group ( composed of representatives of ministries involved in [LOC CFT  ] , the judiciary , and the federal prosecutor 's office ) charged with drafting legislation to criminalize terrorism and its financing . 
The draft legislation was never forwarded from the executive branch to the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congress  ] . 
A long-delayed anti-money laundering bill is still pending before the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congress  ] . 
The bill would facilitate greater law enforcement access to financial and banking records during investigations , criminalize illicit enrichment , allow administrative freezing of assets , and facilitate prosecutions of money laundering cases by amending the legal definition of money laundering and making it an autonomous offense .
