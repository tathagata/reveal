1.5 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: Ambassador [PER Susan Burk  ] , Special Representative of the President for [ORG Nuclear Nonproliferation  ] met with key [ORG Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  ] ( [ORG NPT  ] ) interlocutors in [LOC London  ] , [LOC Paris  ] , and [LOC Berlin  ] from July 14 ) 17 . 
The meetings demonstrated that we have very few differences with these governments on the main objectives for the [ORG Treaty  ] and the 2010 [ORG Review Conference  ] ( [ORG RevCon  ] ) . 
The [LOC UK  ] and [LOC France  ] are quite eager to take strong leadership roles and work closely with us , including on disarmament issues , and to engage with a wide range of [ORG NPT Parties  ] to ensure a successful [ORG RevCon  ] . 
[PER Burk  ] agreed with [LOC UK  ] and [MISC French  ] officials on the importance of coordination among the [LOC P-5  ] on [ORG NPT  ] issues . 
The [LOC UK  ] and [LOC France  ] agreed that we should be ambitious in pursuing our objectives for the [ORG RevCon  ] . 
They differ in one key area , however , with the [LOC UK  ] eager to promote its aggressive disarmament posture and [LOC France  ] defensive about disarmament and concerned that [MISC US/Russian  ] initiatives and [LOC UK  ] unilateral measures will lead to increasing pressures on [LOC France  ] to engage on nuclear disarmament . 
This different perspective is causing considerable unease between the two . 
2 . 
( C ) [MISC German  ] officials were more cautious about goals for the [ORG RevCon  ] , possibly because their evident sensitivity to the views of [ORG Non-Aligned Movement  ] states leads them to focus on the gulf between those states and the [LOC West  ] . 
All three governments with whom we met see [LOC Iran  ] as perhaps the biggest problem for the [ORG NPT  ] , and believe that high-level intervention with [LOC Egypt  ] will be necessary to resolve the [LOC Middle East  ] issue at the [ORG RevCon  ] . 
[PER Burk  ] was asked at every stop about the relationship of the [MISC U.S.-proposed  ] nuclear security summit to the [ORG RevCon  ] ; she described the events as related and complementary , rather than linked . 
3 . 
( U ) In [LOC London  ] and [LOC Paris  ] , [PER Burk  ] was joined by [MISC ISN/MNSA  ] Deputy Director [PER Scott Davis  ] , [MISC OSD’s  ] [PER Amy Prible  ] , and [PER Adam Scheinman  ] , Director of [ORG Nonproliferation  ] , [ORG National Security Council  ] . 
[PER Davis  ] and [PER Prible  ] also attended the [LOC Berlin  ] meetings . 
End Summary [LOC UNITED KINGDOM  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG Amb  ] . 
[PER Burk  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] wanted to see the [ORG RevCon  ] reaffirm Parties’ support for the [ORG Treaty  ] and indicated that specific [LOC U.S.  ] objectives for the [ORG Conference  ] include enforcing [ORG Treaty  ] compliance , strengthening [ORG IAEA  ] safeguards , dissuading [ORG NPT Parties  ] from abusing the [MISC Treaty’s  ] withdrawal provision , ensuring that the growth in nuclear energy does not increase proliferation risks , and endorsing President [PER Obama’s  ] disarmament agenda while being realistic about the pace of disarmament . 
She indicated that the [LOC United States  ] stands by the agreements reached at the 1995 and 2000 [MISC RevCons  ] but ten years will have elapsed since the last positive [ORG RevCon  ] and the parties needed to look forward . 
She pointed out that the upcoming [ORG Conference  ] is an important international event , but is not an end in itself . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] sought a constructive review of the [ORG Treaty  ] that would impart valuable momentum to other efforts to strengthen the regime. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [LOC UK  ] Director of Defence and [ORG Strategic Threats Simon Manley  ] replied that the [LOC UK  ] agrees that the [ORG RevCon  ] is only a step in a process but that the [ORG NPT  ] has become a major political issue in his country . 
He said that the third PrepCom was better than expected - “almost Nirvana” - but that there was a lack of coherence among the [LOC P-5  ] that “did us no favors.” [PER Manley  ] and his [LOC UK  ] colleagues frequently praised President [PER Obama’s  ] leadership on nonproliferation and disarmament . 
[PER Manley  ] noted the “positive vibes” resulting from [LOC U.S.  ] initiatives on FMCT and [MISC CTBT  ] , but added that [LOC China  ] and [LOC France  ] are uncomfortable about recent developments on disarmament . 
He and [PER Burk  ] agreed that our governments need to continue to work hard to explain how much we have done to reduce our numbers of and reliance on nuclear weapons. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Manley  ] suggested that recent developments have put the [ORG NAM  ] “off balance” on disarmament but that the nuclear-weapon states need to discuss how to handle the “13 practical steps” to disarmament from the 2000 [ORG RevCon Final Document  ] . 
He added that [PER Mariot Leslie  ] ( [ORG FCO  ] Director General for Defence and Intelligence ) is keen on [LOC P-5  ] cooperation and the need for a positive message on [ORG NPT  ] matters . 
Both sides agreed that intensive P-3 and [LOC P-5  ] engagement is needed to prepare for the [ORG RevCon  ] , noting the value of [LOC P-5  ] consensus and the desire not to let [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] keep us from taking STATE 00082013 002 OF 005 SUBJECT: NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION TREATY ( [ORG NPT  ] ) BILATERALS WITH [LOC UK  ] , [LOC FRANCE  ] , AND [MISC GERMA  ] credit for our disarmament initiatives . 
As [PER Burk  ] put it , we should not “pull our punches” for the sake of [LOC P-5  ] consensus . 
[PER Manley  ] expressed [LOC UK  ] concerns about [MISC French  ] attitudes , suggesting [LOC Paris  ] has not “come through the thought process” on eliminating nuclear weapons and worries about proposals for multilateral disarmament. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Manley  ] and [PER Nick Lowe  ] ( [LOC Head  ] , [ORG Nuclear Issues Section  ] , [ORG FCO Counter-Proliferation Department  ] ) agreed with the [LOC U.S.  ] focus on addressing non-compliance and withdrawal . 
[PER Lowe  ] said that we should not allow the [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC North Korea  ] issues to damage the [ORG RevCon  ] but also should not “let them off the hook.” [PER Burk  ] pointed out that third PrepCom Chairman [PER Boniface Chidyausiku  ] had praised the [LOC United States  ] for handling [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC North Korea  ] in a “generic” fashion at the PrepCom , rather than frequently criticizing these countries by name . 
When [PER Burk  ] mentioned concerns about [MISC Syrian  ] nuclear activities , [PER Liane Saunders  ] ( [LOC Head  ] , [ORG Counter-Proliferation Department  ] , [ORG FCO  ] ) pointed out that the recent [MISC G-8  ] summit statement on nonproliferation omitted reference to the subject because [LOC Russia  ] insisted that any such reference also mention [MISC Israel’s  ] strike on a [MISC Syrian  ] facility in 2007. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Burk  ] expressed concern about the [ORG NAM  ] argument that [MISC Western  ] states are trying to change the [ORG Treaty  ] by arguing for universal adherence to the Additional Protocol and said we needed to make clear we are seeking to strengthen the regime , not amend the [ORG Treaty  ] . 
She took the opportunity to suggest that [ORG IAEA  ] member states need to provide the [MISC Agency the resources  ] it needs to carry out its mission and noted USG support for a meaningful increase in the [MISC Agency’s  ] regular budget . 
[PER Peter Carter  ] ( [LOC Head  ] , [ORG Nuclear Non-Proliferation , Department of Energy  ] , and [PER Judith Gough  ] ( Deputy [LOC Head  ] , [ORG Security Policy Group  ] , [ORG FCO  ] ) replied that the [ORG IAEA  ] needs to make the “business case” for how it will use such resources. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Carter  ] said that efforts on multilateral fuel cycle arrangements need to get beyond have/have not tensions . 
[PER Manley  ] added that mistrust is high and that the March conference on nuclear energy , held in [LOC London  ] , reflected that this problem has gotten worse . 
[PER Lowe  ] pointed out that none of the relevant proposals ask consumer states to give up their rights to peaceful uses . 
[PER Burk  ] suggested that we should be able to make this a positive debate by explaining how the [ORG NPT  ] and a strong and reliable nonproliferation regime facilitate the sharing of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes , including for power. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Both sides acknowledged how difficult the [LOC Middle East  ] aspect of the [ORG NPT  ] is , with [PER Burk  ] saying that it needs to be considered in the context of the broader matter of regional security . 
[PER Manley  ] expressed concern about Egypt’s efforts to create momentum for major demands on the issue . 
[PER Saunders  ] noted [MISC Russian  ] proposals for handling the [LOC Middle East  ] , including a major conference and an [ORG NPT  ] “envoy” to the region , suggesting that [LOC Russia  ] is seeking to “flush [LOC Egypt  ] out” on the issue. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Turning to [ORG NPT  ] diplomacy and process , [PER Jon Noble  ] ( [LOC Head  ] , [MISC Counter-Proliferation  ] and [ORG Security Cooperation  ] , [ORG MOD  ] ) suggested that modifying the [ORG RevCon  ] rules to allow decisions by majority instead of the current practice requiring consensus would allow [ORG Parties  ] to adopt more meaningful statements . 
[PER Burk  ] replied that a majority rule is a “two-edged sword , ” since votes on important matters could be passed in spite of our disagreement . 
She added that other approaches that could be used at the [ORG RevCon  ] included those used in 1985 , when a final document was adopted that summed up some opposing views ( i.e. , “some believe/others believe” ) , and the issuing of [ORG IAEA  ] information circulars reflecting agreed [ORG RevCon Main Committee  ] language . 
Discussion then turned to coordinating on respective efforts to influence [ORG NAM Parties  ] , which [PER Manley  ] termed “mapping.” Part of the challenge is to demonstrate to such [ORG Parties  ] how the [ORG Treaty  ] has benefited them. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Later [PER Burk  ] met with [ORG FCO  ] Minister of [ORG State  ] [PER Ivan Lewis  ] , who reiterated [LOC UK  ] NPT priorities , alluded to [MISC UK-French  ] differences on disarmament , and asked about the connection between the [MISC U.S.-proposed  ] summit on nuclear security and the [ORG NPT RevCon  ] . 
On the latter [PER Burk  ] replied that they two are complementary but separate events . 
[LOC FRANCE  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Gerard Araud  ] ( MFA Political Director ) opened the session and stayed for 45 minutes of the nearly half-day of meetings . 
He began by noting that he was “nervous” about the [ORG STATE  ] 00082013 003 OF 005 SUBJECT: NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION TREATY ( [ORG NPT  ] ) BILATERALS WITH [LOC UK  ] , [LOC FRANCE  ] , AND [MISC GERMA  ] evolution of [LOC U.S.  ] nuclear policy and offered what he called a “psychological analysis” of [MISC France’s  ] perspective on its nuclear capability . 
He asserted that nuclear deterrence is part of his country’s “international identity” and that [LOC France  ] does not want nuclear weapons to be de-legitimized , as some [ORG NPT Parties  ] would like to do . 
He said that President [PER Obama  ] has set out the prospect of elimination of such weapons but that we need to control the unreasonable expectations of other countries , including [LOC Canada  ] , the [LOC Netherlands  ] , [LOC Sweden  ] , and the [ORG European Union  ] in general . 
And [LOC China  ] hides behind the efforts of the other P-5 states to avoid pressure for limits on its own nuclear arsenal. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) For [MISC France’s  ] part , [PER Araud  ] said that President Sarkozy’s March 2008 nuclear policy speech contained concrete proposals on disarmament . 
Citing a statement in the President’s [LOC Cairo  ] speech - “no nation should pick and choose which nation holds nuclear weapons” - [PER Araud  ] asked the [LOC United States  ] to warn [LOC France  ] if we intend to change our rhetoric further . 
He also argued that the nonproliferation and peaceful uses pillars of the [ORG NPT  ] are more important than disarmament. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Burk  ] replied that the [LOC United States  ] has no illusions that disarmament will be easy or rapid , particularly if other states are building up nuclear arsenals . 
She said that President [PER Obama  ] is seeking to reinvigorate the [ORG NPT  ] and the regime in general . 
It is the [LOC U.S.  ] hope that progress on disarmament will serve as leverage for a stronger commitment to nonproliferation by non-nuclear-weapon states , but [LOC U.S.  ] flexibility in this area obviously has its limits . 
[PER Burk  ] also said the [LOC U.S.  ] wants to pursue a bold set of objectives at the [ORG RevCon  ] , which she described in terms similar to those she used in [LOC London.  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER Jacques Audibert  ] ( MFA Director for Strategic Affairs , Security , and Disarmament ) assured [PER Burk  ] that he is “not nervous” but , referring to [LOC UK  ] policy changes , believes the P-5 is imbalanced regarding views on disarmament and that the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC France  ] need to stick together . 
[PER Martin Briens  ] ( DAS for Disarmament and Nuclear Nonproliferation ) added that the [LOC UK  ] is starting to seem really convinced that disarmament is possible , since it may abandon its Trident submarine-launched ballistic missile program . 
At the [LOC PrepCom  ] , the [LOC UK  ] delegation even seemed to be acting as a “mediator” between [LOC France  ] and the [ORG NAM  ] and was mainly motivated by seeking to avoid disagreements. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [PER Briens  ] argued that [LOC Iran  ] is the most serious problem for the [ORG NPT  ] , and [LOC France  ] was the only Party that mentioned it explicitly in its general statement to the recent [LOC PrepCom  ] . 
To ensure a serious treatment of this problem , we bridges must be built with the [ORG NAM  ] and we must work with more reasonable [ORG Parties  ] like [LOC Jordan  ] . 
Iran’s non-compliance should be mentioned in any [ORG RevCon  ] consensus document , but it would not be “the end of the world” if such a document was not adopted , adding that we should not “seek success at all costs.” <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) The [MISC French  ] were particularly harsh about Egypt’s [ORG NPT  ] behavior . 
[PER Araud  ] called its attitude “unacceptable , ” and [PER Briens  ] called the [MISC Egyptians  ] “ideologues” on the [LOC Middle East  ] and disarmament . 
[PER Briens  ] averred that [LOC Egypt  ] is campaigning among [MISC Arab  ] states against the Additional Protocol and expressed annoyance that [LOC Egypt  ] had rejected the [ORG EU  ] suggestion of a seminar on [LOC Middle East  ] security until after the [ORG RevCon  ] . 
He concluded: “The nastier they are , the more they get out of the process.” [PER Michel Miraillet  ] ( Under Secretary of Defence for Policy ) noted [MISC Egyptian  ] enrichment efforts , stated with suspicion that [LOC Egypt  ] had known a lot about the [MISC Libyan  ] nuclear program and the [PER A.Q. Khan  ] network , and suggested that [LOC Egypt  ] has been reacting to “humiliation” it believes it suffered at the 1995 [ORG RevCon  ] . 
[PER Burk  ] acknowledged that [LOC Egypt  ] could prevent any [ORG RevCon  ] agreement over the [LOC Middle East  ] issue but said we should try to forestall that by fostering progress of some sort on the objectives of the 1995 [ORG NPT  ] resolution on the region that is acceptable to all in the region ( e.g. , including [LOC Israel  ] ) . 
[PER Briens  ] said that [LOC France  ] will raise some of these issues “at a high level.” <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) Regarding the peaceful use of nuclear energy , [PER Briens  ] suggested that we should try to get agreement at the [ORG RevCon  ] at least on the concept that enrichment and reprocessing are not “normal technologies.” In response to [MISC Burk’s  ] appeal to [LOC France  ] to support the proposed increase for the IAEA’s budget so the Agency has sufficient resources to accomplish the tasks that Member States give it , [PER Briens  ] argued that the Agency has funds that it has not even spent . 
[ORG STATE  ] 00082013 004 OF 005 SUBJECT: NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION TREATY ( [ORG NPT  ] ) BILATERALS WITH [LOC UK  ] , [LOC FRANCE  ] , AND [MISC GERMA  ] He mentioned [MISC France’s  ] paper on “Elements for a [ORG Declaration of Principles”  ] on nuclear energy , proposed for adoption by both nuclear supplier and consumer states ( originally provided to [ORG USG  ] in 2008 ) , and asked for [LOC U.S.  ] comments . 
Another draft will be circulated at the end of [LOC July.  ] <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) Discussion then turned to [ORG NPT  ] diplomacy . 
Both sides agreed on the essential need for close P-5 cooperation and for working to persuade other [ORG NPT Parties  ] on the need for progress on both nonproliferation and disarmament . 
[PER Briens  ] said that the [MISC P-3  ] should discuss respective red-lines on disarmament , and [PER Burk  ] agreed that we need to work out how to deal with points on which the [MISC P-3  ] diverge . 
[PER Burk  ] suggested that we engage [ORG NAM Parties  ] that are the beneficiaries of peaceful nuclear cooperation . 
[PER Briens  ] expressed particular frustration with [MISC France’s  ] [ORG EU  ] partners , pointing out that all others had accepted the [LOC PrepCom  ] recommendations draft without a reference to [LOC Iran  ] . 
He said the [ORG EU  ] consists of activists ( presumably including the [LOC Netherlands  ] and [LOC Sweden  ] ) and fence sitters ( central [MISC European  ] states ) , and that the latter category might be helpful on disarmament and the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
[LOC GERMANY  ] <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) [PER Peter Gottwald  ] ( Commissioner of the [ORG Federal Government for Arms Control and Disarmament  ] ) said that [LOC Germany  ] agrees with the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG RevCon  ] objectives described by [PER Burk  ] but admitted that he has “no illusions” about how hard it will be to achieve them and that we cannot be too ambitious . 
A year ago , he suggested , many thought the nonproliferation regime would collapse , mainly because of perceptions that it is unfair , but recent [LOC U.S.  ] initiatives have changed that atmosphere . 
Since we have committed to the elimination of nuclear weapons , the regime’s inequality is now seen as likely to end some day . 
[PER Burk  ] replied that the [LOC United States  ] wants to be ambitious regarding the [ORG RevCon  ] and believes we have an opportunity to do so. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) [PER Gottwald  ] continued that [ORG NAM  ] states also suspect that proposals for multilateral fuel-cycle arrangements may not be fair , though many of them do afford equal treatment , not conditioning access to recipients’ giving up the right to sensitive facilities . 
[PER Burk  ] agreed that this matter is important to the [ORG NPT  ] and that we should frame the proposals as collective efforts to strengthen the regime and to facilitate access to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , including nuclear power. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) In response to his question , [PER Burk  ] assured [PER Gottwald  ] that the [ORG U.S.-proposed Nuclear Security Summit  ] is not in competition with the [ORG NPT  ] [ORG RevCon  ] . 
[PER Gottwald  ] replied that nuclear security and countering nuclear terrorism are matters that should bring [ORG NPT Parties  ] together , thereby helping to strengthen the [ORG Treaty  ] ; [PER Burk  ] agreed . 
This led him to suggest that nuclear security be placed in the wider context of nonproliferation and that the summit be linked to the [ORG NPT  ] . 
[PER Burk  ] said that the subject of nuclear security was one that we believed could be taken up usefully at the [ORG RevCon  ] but said the [LOC U.S.  ] wanted to be careful not to create the perception that a subset of [ORG NPT Parties  ] is somehow “pre-cooking” an outcome for the [ORG RevCon  ] via the [ORG Nuclear Security Summit  ] . 
That is not the case. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) [PER Burk  ] stated that it is important that the [ORG RevCon  ] take a positive approach to the Additional Protocol , but [PER Gottwald  ] said that it would be hard to reach agreement on the subject even among like-minded [ORG Parties  ] . 
He opined that , on the issue of dissuading [ORG Treaty  ] violators from withdrawing , the [MISC Conference  ] could at least “raise awareness” by “developing a common sense that this is a problem.” <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C ) [PER Stefan Kordasch  ] ( Deputy Head of Division , [ORG Nuclear Arms Control and Non-Proliferation  ] ) expressed concern that [LOC Egypt  ] will be aggressive and could instigate a “deal breaker” at the [ORG RevCon  ] . 
Amb . 
[PER Andreas Michaelis  ] ( Director-General for Near and [LOC Middle Eastern Affairs  ] ) explained [MISC Egyptian  ] behavior as over-compensation for having lost much of its leadership role in the [LOC Middle East  ] , particularly within the [ORG Arab League  ] . 
Egypt’s status is now such that it leads only on matters that are not “core interests , ” of [MISC Arab  ] states ( which he appeared to believe is the case for the [ORG Middle East/NPT  ] issue ) . 
He suggested that [LOC Egypt  ] might be satisfied with “status quo” language at the [ORG RevCon  ] plus some kind of “Israeli statement”: “Can you extract something from the [MISC Israelis  ] ? 
Something they have already said ? ” [PER Michaelis  ] stressed the need to engage the [MISC Egyptians  ] at the highest level , i.e. , [PER Mubarak  ] , but also identified [PER Umar Suleiman  ] , the [ORG STATE  ] 00082013 005 OF 005 SUBJECT: NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION TREATY ( [ORG NPT  ] ) BILATERALS WITH [LOC UK  ] , [LOC FRANCE  ] , AND [MISC GERMA  ] head of [MISC Egyptian  ] intelligence , as very influential and a potential useful interlocutor . 
He pointed out that [LOC Germany  ] has set up a ministerial-level steering committee arrangement with [LOC Egypt  ] that could be used to surface the problem of the [LOC Middle East  ] in the [ORG NPT  ] . 
Its first meeting is scheduled for February 2010 ; [ORG NPT  ] could be raised then. <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( C ) [PER Burk  ] also met with Deputy Foreign Policy Advisor [PER Rolf Nikel  ] ( [ORG Chancellery  ] ) , who said he could endorse nearly everything in President [PER Obama’s Prague  ] speech . 
The only question was how to go about achieving its goals . 
He asked detailed questions about [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG NPT  ] priorities , asking which issues the [LOC U.S.  ] considered “most urgent” and which should be addressed first to prepare the way for progress in other areas . 
[PER Burk  ] replied that we are still developing our policies but that part of the challenge is convincing governments to exercise the political will to strengthen the nonproliferation norm. <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( C ) In response to [MISC Nikel’s  ] question about proposals for multilateral fuel-cycle arrangements , [PER Burk  ] pointed out that we need to do a better job of explaining the proposals to counter the [ORG NAM  ] argument that supplier states are seeking to deny them their right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy , which is not true . 
[PER Nikel  ] suggested that we would reach a “crunch point” if [LOC Iran  ] does not respond meaningfully to the [ORG EU  ] 3 3 proposals by the end of the year , after which stronger sanctions could be imposed . 
He pointed out that this scenario would affect the atmosphere for the [ORG RevCon  ] , to which [PER Burk  ] replied that we would need to build unity among Parties to rebuff any obstructionism by [LOC Iran  ] at the [MISC Conference.  ] <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( C ) The last meeting was with [ORG Christian Democratic Bundestag  ] member [PER Eckart  ] von [PER Klaeden  ] and staffers from all the major [MISC German  ] political parties . 
[PER Von Klaeden  ] asked whether the [LOC United States  ] seeks to enforce compliance by amending the [ORG NPT  ] , something [PER Burk  ] assured him is not an option we will pursue . 
Other questions concerned [MISC P-5/NAM  ] disputes , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC CTBT  ] , the [ORG IAEA  ] fuel bank , the [MISC U.S.-proposed  ] nuclear security summit , and concerns about Myanmar’s nuclear intentions .
