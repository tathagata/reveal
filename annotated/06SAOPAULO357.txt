( [ORG SBU  ] ) EconOff recently attended an [MISC American  ] Chamber of [LOC Commerce  ] ( [ORG AmCham  ] ) event featuring Ambassador [PER Regis Percy Arslanian  ] , Director of International Negotiations for the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG MFA  ] ( [ORG Itamaraty  ] ) . 
Well-known to [LOC U.S.  ] diplomats from his tenure as [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG DCM  ] in [LOC Washington  ] as well as his stewardship of the [ORG FTAA  ] talks , he can often be a very difficult interlocutor . 
At the [ORG AmCham  ] , [PER Arslanian  ] 's very frank comments and the subsequent [LOC Q&A  ] session were wide-ranging and covered the future of [ORG FTAA  ] negotiations , [MISC Brazil-U.S.  ] trade , [ORG Brazil-EU  ] trade , [MISC South American  ] trade , challenges facing [LOC Mercosul  ] , [MISC Venezuelan  ] participation in [LOC Mercosul  ] , alleged anti-Americanism in [ORG Itamaraty  ] , and much more . 
END SUMMARY. ------ CAVEAT ------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While [PER Arslanian  ] 's candid remarks at the [ORG AmCham  ] certainly represent his views , on a number of issues [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] higher-ups likely would have configured the message differently . 
The best way to convey the tone and substance of [PER Arslanian  ] 's presentation is to let him speak for himself . 
His preferred technique was to ask himself anticipated questions and then to answer them , as illustrated below . 
Of course , [LOC U.S.  ] trade officials , had they been afforded the opportunity , would have answered [PER Arslanian  ] 's questions differently. ---------------------------------- WHY IS SOUTH-SOUTH TRADE SUCH A PRIORITY FOR [LOC BRAZIL  ] ? ---------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) It 's not that we don't want Free Trade Agreements ( [ORG FTAs  ] ) with the [LOC U.S.  ] or the [ORG European Union  ] ( [ORG EU  ] ) ; to say so would be irresponsible . 
The purpose of an [ORG FTA  ] is to reduce or zero out tariffs ; reduce sanitary , technological , and other non-tariff barriers ; and remove market access restrictions . 
These efforts need to be reciprocal - give and take . 
The cost-benefit of the negotiation must make sense ; the [ORG FTA  ] must create commerce . 
There must be concessions on both sides . 
We're not being ideological about this ; in fact , I 've never received orientation from [ Minister of [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] ] [ORG Amorim  ] to prioritize any negotiation . 
They [ [ORG Itamaraty  ] leadership ] want [ORG FTAs  ] , and big markets are a priority . 
4 . 
( U ) Forming bilateral agreements is one way of advancing towards [ORG FTAA  ] . 
In a few years , if all the region 's countries enter into bilateral agreements , it will be that much easier to reach a positive result with regards to the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
The phase-out periods of the individual bilateral agreements may be different among the respective countries , but after ten or twelve years all the tariffs would be at zero anyway . 
And that 's FTAA. ------------------------------- WHAT ABOUT THE MERCOSUL-EU [ORG FTA  ] ? ------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) We weren't able to close the deal in October of 2004 because [PER Pascal Lamy  ] ( former Commissioner for Trade at the [ORG European Commission  ] and current WTO Director General ) left and our negotiations shut down . 
The agricultural offers on the [ORG EU  ] side were unacceptable . 
They weren't willing to budge on the most important issue - agriculture . 
We told the [ORG EU  ] there 's no point in making a deal without agriculture , and the [ORG EU  ] said that at the time it couldn't put that on the table . 
( NOTE: The [ORG AmCham  ] event was held [PER SAO PAULO  ] 00000357 002 OF 005 shortly before [ORG EU  ] 's most recent rejection of [LOC Mercosul  ] 's overtures . 
[ORG EU  ] diplomats have told us that in the March 2006 negotiating session [LOC Brazil  ] , and in particular [PER Arslanian  ] , appeared to want more to score points with the press than engage in any actual serious discussions . 
The [ORG GOB  ] leaked its latest offer to the press even before the [ORG EU  ] had received it . 
END NOTE . 
) ---------------------------- WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE [ORG FTAA  ] ? ---------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) You need to understand that the [ORG FTAA  ] is a very limited agreement . 
We can't ignore the [LOC U.S.  ] , which receives 22 percent of [LOC Brazil  ] 's exports , but the [LOC U.S.  ] is already very open to us . 
But for agriculture , [LOC Brazil  ] 's most important sector , the [LOC U.S.  ] is very closed ; look at orange juice , for example . 
The orange juice and steel anti-dumping cases have been very troublesome for [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Moreover , there are problems with beef . 
It has been eight years since [LOC Brazil  ] asked the [ORG U.S. Department of Agriculture  ] to certify [MISC Brazilian  ] meat . 
And , we're still waiting . 
Some ask: Why does [LOC Brazil  ] only talk about agriculture ? 
Well , it 's because [MISC American  ] industry is already very open to [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] tariff rates are at 2 percent for industrialized goods . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's industrial tariffs are at 14 percent . 
If we both go to zero , it would be very hard for [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has a lot farther to go , from 14 percent to zero . 
The twenty most significant [MISC Brazilian  ] agricultural products exported to the [LOC U.S.  ] receive a 60 percent tariff . 
In [LOC Brazil  ] , these products receive only 14 percent tariffs . 
[LOC Brazil  ] doesn't distort like the [LOC U.S.  ] does . 
The [ORG FTAA  ] will not go forward because [LOC U.S.  ] industry is very open , but agriculture is closed. -------------------------- AND IF THE [LOC U.S.  ] SAID , " WE'LL REDUCE OUR AGRICULTURE BARRIERS " ? -------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) Even with the elimination of [LOC U.S.  ] agriculture protection , the cost of zeroing out industrial tariffs is too high for [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] would have to reduce from 14 percent to zero , whereas the [LOC U.S.  ] only has to reduce from 2 percent to zero . 
There 's no equilibrium . 
As I mentioned before , trade negotiation needs to be reciprocal - give and take . 
We 'd be giving up 14 percent , and the [LOC U.S.  ] would only be giving up 2 percent . 
That 's not balanced . 
There 's more cost than benefit . 
Moreover , the [LOC U.S  ] would never lower its agricultural barriers . 
It 's not even an economic issue , it 's political . 
At the [ORG FTAA  ] discussions in [LOC Miami  ] , Governor [PER Jeb Bush  ] , President [PER Bush  ] 's brother , spoke to us and said , " The [LOC U.S.  ] will never open on agriculture . 
If it did , orange juice producers in [LOC Florida  ] would go out of business . 
So forget about it . 
" At no time during the [ORG FTAA  ] discussions did the [LOC U.S  ] put a reduction of agriculture tariffs on the table . 
Moreover , [PER USTR Portman  ] at the last [LOC Davos  ] talks told Minister [PER Amorim  ] that [ORG FTAA  ] is shut because of two impasses: Agriculture on the [LOC U.S.  ] side and intellectual property rights ( [ORG IPR  ] ) on the [LOC Brazil  ] side . 
Minister [ORG Amorim  ] responded , " If we do what you ask on [ORG IPR  ] , will you reduce tariffs on orange juice , tobacco , and sugar ? 
" [PER USTR Portman  ] 's answer: " No , we can't do that right now . 
" So , for [LOC Brazil  ] there 's too much cost , and too little benefit . 
And it all comes down to costs . 
As a negotiator , I must look at costs , an equal give and take . 
There is no room for a " light " or " diet " version of the FTAA. ------------------------------------- SO WHAT ARE THE [ORG FTAA  ] COSTS TO [LOC BRAZIL  ] ? ------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) The costs to [LOC Brazil  ] start with the fact that [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG FTAs  ] are based on the [ORG NAFTA  ] model . 
Look at [LOC Chile  ] , CAFTA - they're NAFTA-based . 
The [ORG NAFTA  ] model might be a good fit for other countries , but not for [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Why ? 
Because the benefits are minimal . 
We 'd get little additional access for industrial goods , [PER SAO PAULO  ] 00000357 003 OF 005 where our access to the [LOC U.S.  ] market is already very good . 
And we 'd get no additional access in the most important area - agriculture . 
Also , a [MISC NAFTA-style  ] [ORG FTA  ] would require changes in [MISC Brazilian  ] regulatory institutions and laws that cannot be made . 
We saw the same thing in our [ORG EU  ] negotiations . 
The [ORG EU  ] 's [ORG FTA  ] would require changes in 33 laws and 6 constitutional amendments . 
It 's the same with the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] would have to substantially change many of its laws , just to comply with the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
I'll give you two examples: telecom and sovereign immunity. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) Under [MISC Brazilian  ] telecommunications laws , if a company wants to operate in the telecommunications field , it needs to be physically established in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Under the [ORG FTAA  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] , and the [ORG EU  ] in their negotiations , asked for access to [MISC Brazilian  ] telecom networks , without having a [LOC U.S.  ] company installed here . 
They want access to our telecom networks without bringing jobs , technology , or any benefit to [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Our telecom laws forbid this . 
Participants in the telecom market must have an established , regulated operation in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] would have to rewrite the telecom law to accommodate the [LOC U.S.  ] request . 
For what benefit ? 
We would receive neither jobs nor technology transfer in return. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) Another example is the issue of sovereign immunity . 
If a [LOC U.S.  ] company sets up operations in [LOC Brazil  ] , and can't get a regulatory license , let 's say an environmental permit , then under the [ORG FTAA  ] the [LOC U.S.  ] company could sue the [MISC Brazilian  ] government . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] law allows states to sue states , but a company can't sue a state . 
Can you imagine ? 
Accommodating this request would not only alter a founding principle of our legal system , but it would open the floodgates . 
Everyone would sue the government . 
There are many examples like these in both the [ORG FTAA  ] and [ORG EU  ] negotiations , where accommodating [LOC U.S.  ] or [ORG EU  ] demands would require [LOC Brazil  ] to rewrite its own laws . 
And I ask again , for what benefit ? 
So from [LOC Brazil  ] 's view there are three basic impasses with the [MISC FTAA:  ] one , agriculture - from high tariffs to anti-dumping cases on orange juice ; two , having to restructure [MISC Brazilian  ] laws under the [ORG FTAA  ] " [ORG NAFTA  ] " model ; and three , the Buy [MISC American  ] Act. ------------------------------------- WHAT ABOUT [LOC BRAZIL  ] AND [ORG IPR  ] UNDER [ORG FTAA  ] ? ------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) The [LOC U.S.  ] wants [ORG IPR  ] enforcement . 
[LOC Brazil  ] already has [ORG WIPO  ] ( World intellectual [ORG Property Organization  ] ) obligations . 
[LOC Brazil  ] admits that it doesn't have the resources to enforce all of our [ORG IPR  ] obligations . 
But , then again , neither does the [LOC U.S.  ] Go to M street in [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC DC  ] and you can buy a fake [ORG Gucci  ] purse . 
Or go to [LOC Chinatown  ] in [LOC Manhattan  ] and you can buy a fake [ORG Rolex  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] does recognize that piracy hurts [MISC Brazilian  ] industry more than it hurts [LOC U.S.  ] industries . 
But [LOC Brazil  ] doesn't want to accept additional [ORG IPR  ] obligations under [ORG FTAA  ] , because we can't enforce 100 percent the ones we already have. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) Some criticize [LOC Brazil  ] saying we 've had an [ORG IPR  ] law for ten years with little effect . 
That in ten years 20,000 patents have been applied for and only 200 granted . 
That [LOC Brazil  ] is not looking out for the interests of its own companies by refusing to accept [ORG IPR  ] provisions in the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
That [LOC Brazil  ] is not engaged on the issue and is therefore discouraging technology investment . 
However , our accepting new [ORG IPR  ] obligations under the [ORG FTAA  ] that we cannot enforce is not going to resolve any of these problems . 
The [ORG IPR  ] issue will not be resolved in the [ORG FTAA  ] forum , but through technical cooperation . 
It is a symptom of [LOC Brazil  ] 's lack of resources . 
That 's why we say if the [LOC U.S.  ] wants to increase [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG IPR  ] effectiveness , why doesn't it give us technology and financial assistance ? 
[ORG IPR  ] problems in [LOC Brazil  ] are the result of a lack of resources , not a lack of will. --------------------- [PER SAO PAULO  ] 00000357 004 OF 005 WHAT ABOUT SUBSIDIES ? --------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) [LOC Brazil  ] doesn't have much of a basis to ask the [LOC U.S.  ] to reduce subsidies . 
If we zeroed our tariffs under an [ORG FTA  ] , our own industries would be too vulnerable without subsidies . 
If we were to ask anything it would be to not subsidize those products that are exported within the hemisphere. ------------------------------ WHAT ABOUT 4 + 1 NEGOTIATIONS ? ------------------------------ <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( U ) [LOC Brazil  ] believes that in general sub-regional bilateral agreements , for example , like the [LOC U.S.  ] agreement with [LOC Chile  ] , will facilitate the formation of the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
So that 's what we prefer . 
[LOC Brazil  ] , through [LOC Mercosul  ] , has been trying to negotiate bilateral agreements with several countries . 
[LOC Canada  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] are two examples . 
We like the [ORG FTAA  ] , but we're not going to wait for it . 
In the meantime , we'll go ahead with bilateral agreements . 
[LOC Brazil  ] asked for 4 + 1 from [PER USTR Portman  ] , and we are still waiting for a response . 
15 . 
( U ) In November 2005 , [LOC Brazil  ] sent a letter to [PER USTR  ] to see if we could resolve the [ORG FTAA  ] mandate . 
We even suggested a date and an agenda . 
We haven't heard back yet . 
But [LOC Mercosul  ] has every interest in pursuing 4 + 1 negotiations . 
We're not just going to wait around for a resolution on the [ORG FTAA  ] mandate to move ahead with more free trade between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] . 
We don't just want a dialogue , but negotiations . 
The " [ORG Rose Garden  ] " 4 + 1 was really just a dialogue . 
This time around , we 'd like to negotiate investment , services , and [ORG IPR  ] , although not [ORG IPR  ] enforcement . 
[LOC Brazil  ] and [ORG Mercosul  ] already have formal proposals drafted for an [ORG FTA  ] with the [LOC U.S.  ] There 's no reason for us to cross our arms waiting on the [LOC FTAA.  ] ---------------------------------- ISN'T VENEZUELA'S JOINING [ORG MERCOSUL  ] A POISON PILL FOR 4 + 1 ? ---------------------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) The 4 + 1 discussion has been on the table since December 2004 , long before any [MISC Mercosul  ] discussions with [LOC Venezuela  ] began . 
We're not worried about [PER Chavez  ] 's participation in [LOC Mercosul  ] . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] meets its international obligations . 
And we're sure it will continue to do so as a part of [LOC Mercosul  ] . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] would never inhibit [MISC Mercosul  ] from negotiating with the [ORG U.S. Venezuela  ] signed an adhesion agreement to stick with [MISC Mercosul  ] and follow the group . 
It 's analogous to the [ORG EU  ] . 
The [ORG EU  ] recently added 10 new members . 
[LOC Hungary  ] isn't going to suddenly start running the show . 
Nor are any of the new [ORG EU  ] countries going to start trying to spoil the [MISC EU-Mercosul  ] talks . 
The ten new [ORG EU  ] states didn't start complaining about the [MISC EU-Mercosul  ] negotiations , they agreed to join the [ORG EU  ] and go along with what the [ORG EU  ] already had in motion . 
It will be the same with [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] recognizes that [LOC Venezuela  ] fulfills its international obligations . 
If not , the [LOC U.S.  ] wouldn't buy so much oil from [LOC Venezuela.  ] ------------------------- IS [ORG MERCOSUL  ] A LOST CAUSE ? ------------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( U ) Some claim that little consensus and little power exists within [MISC Mercosul  ] . 
However , there is full understanding among the four members of [LOC Mercosul  ] about our objectives . 
Politically , we all believe in regional integration . 
Moreover , commercially we're very diverse . 
To really enact a customs union without a unified customs service is very difficult . 
The recent [MISC Argentinian  ] [ORG MAC  ] accord ( reftel ) , although not good for [MISC Mercosul  ] , is the best of the evils available . 
Without it , [LOC Argentina  ] would just start acting [PER SAO PAULO  ] 00000357 005 OF 005 unilaterally . 
Such measures will help [LOC Mercosul  ] evolve . 
Although it looks like a step back , it will eventually result in several steps forward . 
Many people forget that the [ORG EU  ] took 50 years to get to where it is today . 
It 's going to take at least that long for [MISC Mercosul  ] to reach that point , probably longer . 
The press tends to evaluate things with a view of about 3 to 5 years out . 
Government planning looks 10 to 20 years ahead . 
But I think we need to look at 20 to 30 years before anything really happens with [LOC Mercosul.  ] ----------------------------------------- WHY DOES [ORG ITAMARATY  ] SEEM SO ANTI-AMERICAN ? ----------------------------------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( U ) Some claim that [ORG Itamaraty  ] , while reaching out to [LOC China  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] , and [LOC Bolivia  ] , is turning its back on the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Itamaraty  ] is not anti-American . 
However , we are anti-NAFTA , or rather against the [ORG NAFTA  ] model for the [ORG FTAA  ] . 
[LOC Mexico  ] , [LOC Chile  ] , and [LOC Central America  ] accepted the [ORG NAFTA  ] model . 
But their circumstances are different than [LOC Brazil  ] 's . 
Many feel that [PER Chavez  ] is only interested in [LOC Mercosul  ] as a way to radicalize his neighbors against the [LOC U.S.  ] We , however , feel no hostility toward the [LOC U.S.  ] If we did , President [PER Bush  ] would have never come to visit President [PER Lula  ] . 
[PER Chavez  ] would have to be very pretentious indeed to use [MISC Mercosul  ] as an anti-American platform . 
Rather , we believe that [PER Chavez  ] wants to join [MISC Mercosul  ] as a way to legitimize himself before the international community . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's population and economy dwarf [LOC Venezuela  ] 's . 
There is no way that [PER Chavez  ] will set the [MISC Mercosul  ] agenda . 
Secretary Rice even recognizes that [LOC Brazil  ] has an important role to play in balancing [PER Chavez  ] 's rhetoric in the region. -------- [ORG BIO NOTE  ] -------- 19 .
