End Summary . 
[ORG Institute of Plasma Physics  ] - Nuclear Research ------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In mid-December 2009 , the [ORG Chinese Academy of Science  ] ( [ORG CAS  ] ) [ORG Institute of Plasma Physics  ] ( [ORG IPP  ] ) in [LOC Hefei  ] , [ORG Anhui Province  ] was preparing for another cycle of experiments with its [ORG Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak  ] ( EAST ) . 
EAST was designed to be a controlled nuclear fusion tokamark reactor with superconductive toroidal and poloidal field magnets and a D-shaped cross-section . 
One of the experimental goals of this device was to prove that a nuclear fusion reaction can be sustained indefinitely , at high enough temperatures , to produce energy in a cost-effective way . 
In 2009 , [ORG IIP  ] successfully maintained a 10 million degree [MISC Celsius  ] plasma nuclear fusion reaction for 400 seconds . 
[ORG IIP  ] also successfully maintained a 100 million degree [MISC Celsius  ] plasma nuclear fusion reaction for 60 seconds . 
One of [MISC IIP’s  ] immediate goals is now to maintain a 100 million degree [MISC Celsius  ] plasma nuclear fusion reaction for over 400 seconds . 
Currently , [ORG IIP  ] is also conducting research into hybrid fusion-fission nuclear reactors that may be able to sustain nuclear reactions indefinitely , and at sufficient temperatures , to cost-effectively produce energy . 
[ORG IIP  ] officials stated that [LOC China  ] has the explicit goal of building at least 70 nuclear fission power plants within the next 10 years . 
[ORG IIP  ] scientists claimed current [MISC Chinese  ] nuclear energy production efforts use [ORG Uranium  ] 235 , but research is being done to make [ORG Uranium  ] 238 a feasible alternative . 
[MISC IIP’s  ] 2009 budget was [MISC USD$20  ] million - a two-fold increase over the previous year - and [ORG IIP  ] leadership expects their budget to increase again in 2010 . 
Roughly one-third of [MISC IIP’s  ] budget comes from [ORG China’s National Development and Reform Commission  ] ( [ORG NDRC  ] ) ; another one-third of the budget comes directly from [ORG CAS  ] , and the final one-third comes from [ORG China’s Ministry of Science  ] and Technology ( [LOC MOST  ] ) . 
According to [ORG IIP  ] leadership , [ORG NDRC  ] has been very laissez-faire in its oversight , but [LOC MOST  ] tends to micromanage projects and the expenditure of money . 
( [ORG COMMENT: Based  ] on personal/discreet conversations with [ORG IIP  ] staff members , the relationship between [ORG CAS  ] and [LOC MOST  ] is strained due to officious and annoying oversight insisted upon by [LOC MOST  ] . 
[ORG IIP  ] scientists much prefer the [ORG NDRC  ] management style and wish more of their funding could come from this body rather than [LOC MOST  ] . 
END COMMENT ) [ORG IIP  ] has roughly 450 full-time staff members , over 400 graduate students , and approximately 100 contractors under its purview . 
[ORG Institute of Intelligent Machines  ] - [ORG Biometrics Research  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG Chinese Academy of Science  ] ( [ORG CAS  ] ) [ORG Institute of Intelligent Machines  ] ( [ORG IIM  ] ) in [LOC Hefei  ] has developed a biometrics device that uses a person’s pace to identify them . 
The device measure weight and two-dimensional sheer forces applied by a person’s foot during walking to create a uniquely identifiable biometrics profile . 
The device can be covertly installed in a floor and is able to collect [LOC BEIJING  ] 00000263 002.4 OF 002 biometrics data on individuals covertly without their knowledge . 
When questioned about the device’s potential applications , [ORG IIM  ] officials stated the device was being used by “secret” customers and was not available on the commercial market . 
[ORG IIM  ] also said they were involved with [ORG China’s  ] “Program 863.” ( [ORG COMMENT: Program  ] 863 is [ORG China’s  ] national high-technology development plan that includes both military and civilian technology development programs ; therefore , it is likely the [ORG People’s Liberation Army  ] ( [ORG PLA  ] ) is one of the customers for whom this biometrics device was developed . 
END COMMENT ) [ORG Institute of Solid State Physics  ] - [ORG Nanotechnology Research  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In mid-December 2009 , the [ORG Chinese Academy of Science  ] ( [ORG CAS  ] ) [ORG Institute of Solid State Physics  ] ( [ORG ISSP  ] ) in [LOC Hefei  ] was conducting research in the fields of computational physics and material science , nanomaterials , and soft-matter physics . 
ISSP’s 2009 budget was roughly $6 million ( USD ) . 
ISSP’s top priority projects are: one-dimensional nanomaterials , spin and charge research using perovskite manganese oxides , and the design and preparation of high-dampening materials . 
[ORG ISSP  ] also conducts research on nanomaterials and nanostructures for [ORG China’s  ] “Program 973.” ( [ORG NOTE: Program  ] 973 is [ORG China’s  ] national plan for improving basic scientific research and development . 
END NOTE ) [ORG Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics  ] - [ORG Spectrometry & Fiber Optic Research  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In mid-December 2009 , the [ORG Chinese Academy of Science  ] ( [ORG CAS  ] ) [ORG Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics  ] ( [ORG IOFM  ] ) in [LOC Hefei  ] was modifying environmental spectrometry technology to detect TATP explosives for use in counter-terrorism efforts . 
[ORG IOFM  ] was also conducting fiber optic research on wave-length division multiplexing ( WDM ) technologies using pulsed and continuous laser sources at both single-mode and multi-mode wavelengths . 
A cursory walk through one of their labs revealed that [ORG IOFM  ] was specifically conducting experiments in the 980-1150 nanometer range , and that they were conducting experiments using hydrogen-filled fiber optic communication lines . 
( [ORG COMMENT: Hydrogen-filled  ] fiber optic lines are technologically challenging to manufacture , but provide many advantages ; one of which is increased security and protection from tampering . 
END COMMENT ) [ORG University of Science  ] and Technology of [LOC China  ] - [ORG Organization & Research  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In mid-December 2009 , the [ORG University of Science  ] and Technology of [LOC China  ] ( [ORG USTC  ] ) in [LOC Hefei  ] had academic programs focusing on Math , [ORG Physics  ] , [ORG Chemistry , Life Sciences  ] , [ORG Nuclear Science  ] , [ORG Engineering  ] , [ORG Computer Science  ] , [ORG Information Technology , Management , Humanities  ] , and a department dedicated to the development of gifted young people . 
[ORG USTC  ] has 37,000 staff and 40,000 graduate students . 
[ORG USTC  ] oversees two national laboratories: the [ORG National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory  ] and the [ORG Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Science  ] at the [ORG Microscale  ] ( [ORG HFNL  ] ) . 
[ORG HFNL  ] has 95 faculty members and roughly 400 graduate students . 
[ORG HFNL  ] research focuses on quantum communication , nanoscience , superconductors , spintronics , and cognitive sciences . 
In the area of quantum communication , [ORG HFNL  ] was conducting research in quantum teleportation and free space quantum cryptography that scientists hope will result in “totally secure” communications . 
[ORG USTC  ] also oversees [ORG China’s  ] “Program 178 , ” although they did not describe the nature of this program . 
( [ORG COMMENT: A  ] cursory walk through their labs seemed to indicate they had already succeeded in single-particle quantum teleportation and are now trying to conduct dual-particle quantum teleportation .
