[LOC PARIS  ] POINTS OF 3/6 Classified By: PolMC [PER Josiah Rosenblatt  ] for reasons 1.4 ( B & D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: Foreign policy has not and probably will not play a prominent role in the [MISC French  ] presidential election campaign , and neither [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] nor [PER Segolene Royal  ] has enunciated a fleshed out foreign policy vision . 
( This message does not discuss emerging " third man " centrist [PER Francois Bayrou  ] , whose views fall somewhere between those of [PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Royal  ] . 
) While it is likely that [MISC French  ] policy overall under a [PER Sarkozy  ] or [PER Royal  ] presidency would be largely marked by continuity , signs are already emerging that the two candidates would -- initially at least -- adopt somewhat different approaches to the [LOC U.S.  ] , the Transatlantic relationship , and [LOC Europe  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] favors a relationship of confidence with the [LOC U.S.  ] based on trust and with each side free to disagree ( a position which is hurting him with voters ) , whereas [PER Royal  ] 's natural reflex is to adopt a more distant and critical approach . 
If both worry that a [ORG NATO  ] built on global partnerships risks undermining the [ORG UN  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] at least explicitly endorses a transatlantic alliance built on shared values and emphasizes the complementarity of [ORG NATO  ] and the [ORG EU  ] . 
If not inherently more pro-European than his counterpart , [PER Sarkozy  ] 's prescription for moving [LOC Europe  ] forward on the basis of a simplified treaty is generally considered as more realistic ( i.e. , attuned to [MISC European  ] realities ) than [PER Royal  ] 's for a new treaty with an enhanced " social ( ist ) " dimension. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) SUMMARY CONT'D: Both candidates favor restoring the place of human rights and democratization as a foreign policy standard , although it is not clear to what extent this would mean increased criticism of [LOC Russia  ] or [LOC China  ] in practice . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] is more openly supportive of [LOC Israel  ] than [PER Royal  ] ( which could make a difference with respect to current GOF consideration of contacts with a [MISC Palestinian  ] NUG ) , but both see resolution of the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] conflict as the key to increased stability across the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
Both candidates are committed to [LOC France  ] 's current policy on [LOC Lebanon  ] , although without the intensive personal engagement of [ORG Chirac  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] is tough on [LOC Iran  ] , and [PER Royal  ] was initially tougher -- but she has moderated her tone of late , perhaps under the influence of new advisors . 
[ORG Chirac  ] 's departure might open the way for either [PER Sarkozy  ] or [PER Royal  ] to engage more positively on [LOC Iraq  ] reconstruction . 
We would expect both to remain serious about [ORG NATO  ] 's engagement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
On [LOC Africa  ] , while [PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Royal  ] alike would put an end to the [ORG Chirac  ] model of personal diplomacy with his counterparts , it is not clear what this would mean in practice . 
[ORG Chirac  ] 's departure will offer a welcome opportunity to reevaluate [MISC French  ] policy in [LOC Africa  ] in particular , including current troop deployments . 
END SUMMARY . 
INTRODUCTION -- IT'S ABOUT THE DOMESTIC AGENDA --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Foreign policy issues so far have not played a prominent role in the [MISC French  ] presidential election campaign , and there is little chance this will change substantially in coming weeks . 
[MISC French  ] voters are focused primarily on whether and to what extent [LOC France  ] needs to reform in order better to adapt to globalization , particularly with respect to the price to be paid in lost jobs and social protections . 
From a [LOC U.S.  ] perspective , of course , what counts most will be the foreign policy orientation of the new president . 
Both the leading candidates -- [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] of the Union for a [ORG Popular Movement  ] ( [ORG UMP  ] ) and [PER Segolene Royal  ] of the [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PS  ] ) -- have in recent weeks outlined views on foreign policy and defense issues ( refs A and B ) and offer some clear indications of what can be expected . 
( This message does not discuss centrist [PER Francois Bayrou  ] , the " third man " neither-Sarkozy nor-Royal candidate whose views fall somewhere between those of [PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Royal  ] , although he is widely regarded as the most pro-European of the three . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] is above all a pragmatist ( witness his recent reversal on [ORG Airbus  ] , where he originally favored a business approach to the issue that he quickly dropped for more state intervention in response to popular pressures ) . 
In contrast , [PER Royal  ] leaves an impression of greater rigidity and ideological orthodoxy . 
This said , neither [PER Sarkozy  ] ( although he came close in his recent press conference , ref A ) nor [PER Royal  ] ( despite her remarks on defense , ref B ) has delivered a formal address on foreign and security policy , and it also bears repeating that what the candidates say in the heat of an election campaign may differ substantially from what they might actually do or not do once elected . 
It is likely that [LOC PARIS  ] 00000921 002 OF 005 [MISC French  ] policy under a [PER Sarkozy  ] or [PER Royal  ] administration would largely be marked by continuity . 
We believe nonetheless that it is possible to draw a few preliminary conclusions about each candidate 's leanings or " reflexes , " particularly with respect to the [LOC U.S.  ] and the transatlantic relationship ; market liberalization ; [LOC Europe  ] , human rights and democratization ; and [LOC Africa  ] . 
FRENCH-U.S . 
AND [MISC TRANSATLANTIC  ] RELATIONS --------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) As their public positioning makes clear , [PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Royal  ] differ perhaps most in their approaches to the [LOC United States  ] , primarily in tone if not substance , although the one invariably bleeds into the other . 
Beginning with his September 2006 visit to the [LOC U.S.  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] has deliberately and systematically spoken in favor of putting the [MISC U.S.-France  ] relationship on a new footing based on mutual confidence and trust . 
Not only in response to ( demagogic ) accusations from the left that this shift risked turning him into an [MISC American  ] " poodle , " [PER Sarkozy  ] at the same time has made clear that the relationship would have to be based on equality , with [LOC France  ] also free to differ with the [LOC U.S.  ] -- he cited his opposition to [LOC Turkey  ] 's [ORG EU  ] accession as one salient example . 
Significant is not that [PER Sarkozy  ] has abandoned Gaullism -- he has not -- but that he has attempted to define it in a way that is more explicitly [MISC America-friendly  ] or at least [MISC America-compatible  ] . 
Above all , he has spelled out the need for active engagement with the [LOC U.S.  ] at all times ; the assumption is that [LOC France  ] should be able to work together with the [LOC U.S.  ] unless , in a given situation , our views are fundamentally incompatible . 
In cases of disagreement ( e.g. , [LOC Iraq  ] ) , the clear implication is that [LOC France  ] would stand aside rather than actively seek , as [ORG Chirac  ] did in 2003 , to marshal a coalition against the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] 's pro-Americanism is an electoral liability for him , and his opponents , [PER Royal  ] foremost among them , are using it as a campaign issue against him. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Royal  ] has yet to enunciate with anything approaching the same degree of clarity the kind of relationship she would seek with the [LOC U.S.  ] , owing at least partly to her relative inexperience . 
But she leaves the lingering impression of someone who reflexively wants to keep her distance from the [LOC U.S.  ] In part this is the product of a lack of direct and personal experience with the [LOC United States  ] . 
It also reflects the accumulated weight of traditional leftist preconceptions -- not to say prejudices -- of the [LOC U.S.  ] as a hegemonic and unilateral power ( leaving aside hot-button and publicly popular issues such as environmentalism , climate warming , globalization , and our more limited social safety net ) . 
Emblematic of this distancing has been the relatively greater difficulty we have had in setting up meetings with her and her staff , or her initial inclination -- before she abandoned the idea altogether -- to travel to the [LOC U.S.  ] and meet only with certain members from the [ORG Democratic Party  ] and none from the [ORG Administration  ] . 
Moreover , in her public utterances , [PER Royal  ] has explicitly accused the [LOC U.S.  ] for contributing to global instability . 
The clear implication is that the [MISC French  ] role in international affairs , more than working with the [LOC U.S.  ] , should consist of presenting alternatives to our vision . 
[ORG NATO  ] AND THE [ORG EU  ] --------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) These differences of approach are well illustrated in the candidates' attitudes toward the [ORG NATO Alliance  ] and [ORG European Security  ] ( [ORG ESDP  ] ) . 
As [ORG Chirac  ] before them , [PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Royal  ] alike object to [ORG NATO  ] 's evolving global role , and both cite the argument that the [LOC U.S.  ] vision for [ORG NATO  ] , through global partnerships and assuming out-of-theatre missions that go beyond its traditional military role , could lead [ORG NATO  ] to become a competitor for the [ORG UN  ] . 
Both candidates also insist on the importance of increased [ORG EU  ] autonomy and cooperation on defense ( [ORG ESDP  ] ) , as well as on the capability of taking independent action outside [ORG NATO  ] . 
But they appear to differ significantly in their basic attitudes toward the [ORG Alliance  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] explicitly referred to the transatlantic relationship as indispensable for being based on common values ; he also called for retiring old arguments over the pre-eminence of the one the other , calling them mutually complementary and noting that not all [ORG EU  ] member states are [ORG NATO  ] Allies and vice versa ( which may also be convenient in the case of [LOC Turkey  ] ) . 
Although committed to the idea of a political [LOC Europe  ] as independent actor , [PER Sarkozy  ] 's envisions [LOC Europe  ] acting jointly with or in parallel with the [LOC U.S.  ] , but not as an alternative or counterweight to the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Royal  ] 's departure point is that [LOC Europe  ] needs to evolve and to reinforce its security capabilities in order to present an potential alternative to the [LOC U.S.  ] , although beyond her distaste for the use of [LOC PARIS  ] 00000921 003 OF 005 military force , she has offered few prescriptions as to how that would occur. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The two candidates also differ with respect to the importance of defense . 
While [PER Royal  ] and [PER Sarkozy  ] have voiced support for maintaining defense expenditures at two percent of GDP , [PER Sarkozy  ] insisted that it should be " at least " two percent . 
In public debates and discussions , [PER Royal  ] has moreover indicated a willingness to reassess [LOC France  ] 's defense budget and programs , most notably questioning the need for the construction of a second aircraft carrier . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] , for his part , has made it clear he supports a strong defense and that the planned construction of a second carrier must go forward . 
[LOC FRANCE  ] AND [LOC EUROPE  ] ----------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] does not have a reputation as an avid pro-Europeanist , and he has not hesitated on occasion , like [ORG Chirac  ] , to blame the [ORG EU  ] for some of [LOC France  ] 's problems , mainly in connection with trying to prevent the migration of money and jobs to the newer member states with fewer social protections , or promoting a level of political control over [MISC European  ] monetary policy . 
He has criticized " fiscal dumping " by newer member states with lower cost and other barriers to investment . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has also advocated [MISC EU-wide  ] coordination on domestically sensitive issues such as immigration . 
[PER Royal  ] represents a party that traditionally is viewed as more pro-European , although many of her positions do not differ dramatically from [PER Sarkozy  ] 's on the surface ( although [PER Sarkozy  ] has been much more strident in calling for a coordinated [ORG EU  ] immigration policy ) . 
However , mainly to satisfy that part of her electorate which voted against the [ORG EU  ] constitutional treaty despite its pro-European tradition , [PER Royal  ] has put more stress on promoting a more " social " [LOC Europe  ] that would adopt [MISC EU-wide  ] standards for social protections and labor rights. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Indeed , where the candidates diverge most is in the remedies they would prescribe for overcoming the current impasse on the [ORG EU  ] constitutional treaty . 
There is already evidence that [PER Sarkozy  ] 's pragmatic proposal for a " simplified treaty " ( formerly referred to as a mini-Treaty ) that would focus on institutional reforms and not require ratification through popular referendum has made inroads even with the [MISC Germans  ] , notwithstanding the official [MISC German  ] position on retaining the existing draft constitutional treaty . 
By contrast , the [MISC Germans  ] have privately expressed to us , and [MISC French  ] press reports corroborate this view , considerable concern over [PER Royal  ] 's calls for a new referendum on an improved treaty , which they see as a recipe for another [MISC French  ] rejection . 
[PER Royal  ] has argued that a referendum could be successful if a revised treaty were to include additional social protections , but it seems likely that this would make the treaty unacceptable to a number of other [MISC European  ] partners ( in particular the [LOC UK  ] ) , and would lengthen the negotiating process in any case . 
In sum , although [PER Royal  ] may be more pro-European in theory , in practice [PER Sarkozy  ] seems more likely to move the [MISC European  ] project forward over the short term . 
FREE MARKET LIBERALISM ---------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Although [PER Sarkozy  ] is viewed by many [MISC French  ] voters as a radical free-market " liberal , " in fact his differences with [PER Royal  ] may be less significant than labels would indicate . 
As the [MISC Airbus  ] controversy has shown , [PER Sarkozy  ] does not hesitate to shed his free-market rhetoric when he believes the market is not looking after [LOC France  ] 's interests . 
Both [PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Royal  ] support " economic patriotism , " even if [PER Sarkozy  ] rhetorically speaks more of [MISC European  ] than strictly [MISC French  ] champions . 
That said , partly out of necessity in order to help reduce [LOC France  ] 's high debt , [PER Sarkozy  ] would remain more interested than his Socialist counterpart in privatization of state-owned enterprises . 
Unlike [PER Royal  ] , he also supports cutting corporate tax rates , cutting all payroll taxes on overtime beyond the statutory limit of 35 hours , and ending [LOC France  ] 's two-tiered labor market as a means of tackling [LOC France  ] 's chronic unemployment . 
As noted earlier , however , [PER Sarkozy  ] 's " liberalism " has often in the past been trumped by political expediency -- which would likely be the hallmark of a [PER Sarkozy  ] presidency . 
His demand for more [MISC European-wide  ] coordination on fiscal policy as a means of reducing relocation of [MISC French  ] jobs to other [ORG EU  ] member countries is emblematic of bending liberal principle to accommodate [MISC French  ] interests . 
HUMAN RIGHTS AND DEMOCRATIZATION [LOC PARIS  ] 00000921 004 OF 005 -------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Both [PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Royal  ] have called for restoring more prominence to human rights and democratization as a means of remaining true to [LOC France  ] 's heritage and its universal mission . 
How far either candidate would be prepared to make transformational diplomacy a cornerstone of his or her foreign policy in reality remains an open question , however . 
It is likely that [PER Royal  ] would take a more principled approach to human rights questions than her counterpart , and it is telling that [PER Sarkozy  ] justified his criticism of [LOC Russia  ] 's human rights record in [LOC Chechnya  ] primarily by arguing that , in the modern media age , it is no longer possible to hide human rights violations as before , which in turns creates public pressures that cannot be ignored . 
At this stage of the campaign , the jury is still out on whether human rights considerations would become a main driver of [MISC French  ] foreign policy . 
What seems certain is that neither [PER Sarkozy  ] nor [PER Royal  ] will be driven by the sometimes sentimental approach of [ORG Chirac  ] , whose admiration for countries with their own long histories and traditions ( e.g. , [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] ) with a skepticism of the applicability of [MISC Western  ] notions of democracy and human rights to other countries and civilizations . 
THE [LOC MIDDLE EAST  ] AND [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Similar considerations also apply toward both candidates' likely approaches to the [LOC Middle East  ] and [LOC Africa  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] differs dramatically from [PER Royal  ] in his insistent emphasis on the need to take [MISC Israeli  ] security interests into account . 
This might eventually affect [PER Sarkozy  ] 's policy on dealing with a [MISC Palestinian  ] national unity government , where the GOF of late has argued that it would be a mistake to isolate [ORG Hamas  ] completely if it fails to explicitly accept the Quartet conditions . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has indirectly criticized [ORG Chirac  ] for his overriding attachment to maintaining stability for its own sake , which encourages authoritarian rule . 
That said , both candidates accept the conventional wisdom that the key to resolving the range of conflicts and tensions in the [LOC Middle East  ] is to find a solution to the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] conflict. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Both candidates are also committed to maintaining current [MISC French  ] policy toward [LOC Lebanon  ] , although neither will be driven by [ORG Chirac  ] 's loyalty to the memory of former PM [PER Rafic Hariri  ] -- both in terms of personal involvement , and [LOC Lebanon  ] 's centrality to [MISC French  ] policy on the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] and his foreign policy advisors are tough-minded on [LOC Iran  ] . 
Royal initially was tougher , demanding that [LOC Iran  ] be prevented from developing a civilian nuclear capacity , as permitted under the [ORG NPT  ] . 
This demand was notably absent from her most recent foreign policy remarks . 
( This may reflect increasing influence of former Foreign Minister [PER Hubert Vedrine  ] , who is far more dovish with regard to an [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear capability , including military . 
) We would expect [PER Sarkozy  ] or Royal to maintain [LOC France  ] 's commitment to [ORG NATO  ] 's engagement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Finally , [ORG Chirac  ] 's departure from the scene should result in greater openness to opportunities to assist in [LOC Iraq  ] 's reconstruction . 
[LOC AFRICA  ] ------ <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) On [LOC Africa  ] , both candidates have indicated that they would like above all to change the manner in which [LOC France  ] does business in [LOC Africa  ] , with [PER Sarkozy  ] going so far as to stress [LOC France  ] 's desire to reduce its military footprint ( except in coordination with the [ORG AU  ] or under the authority of the [ORG UN  ] ) . 
But this does not mean withdrawal , and [LOC France  ] will continue to want to leverage its influence to the greatest extent possible -- perhaps through an increased [ORG EU  ] role -- even as it competes with the growing influence of the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC China  ] . 
But both candidates understand they will no longer be able to rely ( nor do they appear to want to ) on the kinds of personal relationships that [ORG Chirac  ] developed over many years with a number of [MISC African  ] leaders . 
The departure of [ORG Chirac  ] will allow the [MISC French  ] foreign policy establishment a welcome opportunity to reevaluate [MISC French  ] policy toward [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] , [LOC Chad  ] , and the [LOC Central African Republic  ] . 
Inevitably , troop redeployments across [LOC Africa  ] will come under consideration . 
NEITHER QUITE WHAT HE/SHE SEEMS ------------------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Whoever is finally elected , we believe that the bilateral [MISC U.S.-France  ] relationship will eventually settle [LOC PARIS  ] 00000921 005 OF 005 into a kind of normal balance based on our enduring shared interests and values and the intertwined nature of our economies on the one hand , and the requirement of a distinct [MISC French  ] voice and authentically independent positions in the international arena , on the other . 
In the case of [PER Sarkozy  ] , we believe it will be important not to set our expectations too high , since even his pragmatism will always be tempered by the Gaullist imperative of a [MISC French  ] " difference , " in particular vis-a-vis the [LOC U.S.  ] As for [PER Royal  ] , although we would expect her , at least initially , to maintain more of a distanced approach to the [LOC U.S.  ] , there is no reason to believe that she would be anything but pragmatic over the longer term . 
In all likelihood , her personal comfort level would rise with increased contact and experience , and foreign policy under a Royal presidency would be characterized by the signature [MISC French  ] mix of strategic convergence with the [LOC U.S.  ] , heavily marked by strategic differences and tactical disagreements .
