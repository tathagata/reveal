Reasons: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C/NF ) Eight directors , including the CEO , of [LOC Algeria  ] 's national oil company [ORG Sonatrach  ] are under investigation for corruption and have been fired and replaced . 
Industry insiders fear company operations will soon be affected . 
[LOC Algeria  ] 's intelligence services are leading the investigation . 
This scandal is the latest in a dramatically escalating series of investigations and prosecutions that we have seen since last year involving [MISC Algerian  ] government ministries and public enterprises . 
Significantly , many of the ministries affected are headed by ministers considered close to [MISC Algerian  ] President [PER Bouteflika  ] , including Energy /Mines Minister [PER Chekib Khelil  ] . 
Speculation is rife that political infighting between civilian and military leadership lies behind the case , but we have no hard evidence . 
[PER Bouteflika  ] 's determined silence is only fueling the uncertainty . 
End summary . 
Eight Senior Officials Implicated --------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) A corruption scandal has broken involving [LOC Algeria  ] 's largest company , the state oil and gas monopoly [ORG Sonatrach  ] . 
The press first reported on January 14 that an examining magistrate ordered [ORG Sonatrach  ] 's CEO [PER Mohamed Meziane  ] , VP for pipelines [PER Benamar Zenasni  ] , VP for upstream activity [PER Boumediene Belkacem  ] , and five other company executives to answer questions concerning allegations of irregularities in the awarding of contracts to two consulting firms owned by [PER Meziane  ] 's sons and a supplier of security equipment . 
They were questioned for twenty hours. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) All eight [ORG Sonatrach  ] officials were then placed under formal investigation ( " judicial control " ) which requires a person to report periodically to police and not leave the country ) . 
Some were detained . 
[PER Meziane  ] himself was placed under judicial control ; the two [ORG Sonatrach VPs  ] were detained in [LOC Serkadji  ] prison . 
An additional [ORG Sonatrach  ] senior official , VP for commercialization [PER Chawki Rahal  ] , was placed under judicial control . 
Four [ORG Sonatrach  ] directors ( for social affairs , exploration , pipelines and transport , and commercialization ) were placed under judicial control . 
[PER Meziane  ] 's two sons were detained -- some stories say , for being major shareholders in companies to which the [ORG Sonatrach  ] contracts were awarded . 
All efforts by defense lawyers to lift the detentions and judicial control have been rejected . 
Outside [ORG Sonatrach  ] , former CEO of the [ORG bank Credit Populaire  ] d'Algerie [PER Hachemi Meghaoui  ] and his son were ordered detained. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [PER Abdelhafid Feghouli  ] , VP for downstream operations , was immediately appointed acting [ORG Sonatrach  ] CEO . 
The three other VPs under suspicion have been replaced . 
Energy/Mines Minister Dr. [PER Chakib Khelil  ] , whose ministry has responsibility for [ORG Sonatrach  ] , claimed in a January 17 press conference that the investigation had caught him unawares and that all he knew was what had been reported in the press . 
He has since refused to discuss the allegations or take responsibility for the affair , saying February 2 that he had no details of the charges and that he would not resign . 
[PER Khelil  ] pleaded that he was responsible for the entire energy sector but not for managing [ORG Sonatrach  ] or any of the some 50 other state energy companies under his ministry 's purview . 
He assured the press soon after the affair broke that [ORG Sonatrach  ] 's production would not be affected and that the company would continue to carry out all projects underway . 
The week of January 24 , the press reported that [ORG Sonatrach  ] lawyers would not defend the suspects , since [ORG Sonatrach  ] was a victim of the fraud they are suspected of committing . 
Foreign Producers Worried ------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) Ambassador on January 27 met [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[PER Meziane  ] XXXXXXXXXXXX sources tell him the issue under investigation is [ORG Sonatrach  ] 's granting of sole-source contracts . 
[ORG Sonatrach  ] 's regulations specify strict conditionsfor this type of contract ( " procedure [MISC R-115  ] " ) . 
Only CEO [PER Meziane  ] would have had authority to authorize and approve them. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had heard that 1,600 such contracts were under investigation . 
Some of these contracts reportedly went through [PER Meziane  ] 's sons . 
A few years earlier , [ORG Sonatrach  ] had pressed [ORG Anadarko  ] to enter into one such contract jointly with the [MISC U.S.-Algerian  ] joint venture [ORG BRC  ] ( [PER Brown  ] and [MISC Root-Condor  ] ) to develop the el-Merk oilfield . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the contract was never carried out , [ORG BRC  ] was liquidated , and [ORG Sonatrach  ] in 2008 awarded the el-Merk contract to [ORG Anadarko  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that this contract was not/not one of those under investigation . 
( Comment: [ORG BRC  ] , nonetheless , figures in the list of ongoing investigations cited in the press . 
End comment ) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that [PER Abdelhafid Ferghouli  ] , former VP for downstream operations now appointed interim CEO , is the one ( now former ) [ORG Sonatrach  ] VP with whom [ORG Anadarko  ] was not acquainted . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] doubted he would last long or beeffective in the top position . 
No one expects the [ORG Sonatrach  ] executives under investigation to return to their previous positions . 
Continuity of [ORG Sonatrach Operations  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) Energy/Mines Minister [PER Khelil  ] 's Jan. 17 assurances that company operations would be unaffected have not gone unchallenged . 
Several press reports sourced to industry insiders and experts say that fear has paralyzed [ORG Sonatrach  ] upper ranks , who are all afraid to make a decision . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] view paralleled this assessment , and we have heard similar views from [MISC French  ] -- quite concerned about [ORG Sonatrach  ] because of the [MISC French  ] oil company Total 's exposure here -- and other diplomats . 
He said that all senior executives , at least in the upstream end of operations he is familiar with , are looking over their shoulders and afraid to make decisions or sign anything . 
The company would not sign amendments to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] insurance contracts on oil production necessitated by the 2009 budget amendments ( Complementary Finance Law ) -- contracts for which former VP for [ORG Upstream Operations Belkacem  ] was responsible . 
[ORG Sonatrach  ] had contracted foreign insurance companies to provide this insurance . 
Now these companies were not getting paid . 
Before long , they would cease insuring [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] production operations . 
If that happened , work would stop . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] fields are the largest upstream project with foreign participation in [LOC Algeria  ] . 
Leading Role of [LOC Algeria  ] 's [ORG Intelligence Services  ] --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) All papers report that [LOC Algeria  ] 's equivalent to the [ORG DNI  ] , the [ORG Departement du Renseignement  ] et de [PER la Securite  ] ( [ORG DRS  ] ) , which is no longer under the [ORG Ministry of National Defense  ] , carried out the investigation . 
Although DRS' move out of the shadows and into the limelight has been unprecedented , its special investigative service for internal corruption has been active for years ( i.e. , even as far back as the [PER Boumedienne  ] era ) . 
The magazine " [MISC Jeune Afrique  ] " recently claimed , for example , that [ORG DRS  ] had investigated 1650 elected [MISC Algerian  ] local officials ( or about one out of ten ) since 2002 for corruption . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was well aware of DRS' involvement in the [ORG Sonatrach  ] case and related that former VP [PER Belkacem  ] , in many meetings with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , had been extremely careful in what he said when others , even company waiters , were present . 
He was very guarded over the telephone . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] imputed this behavior to concern over [ORG DRS  ] surveillance . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] confided that [ORG DRS  ] has interviewed many of [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] company 's local staff . 
Political Ramifications ----------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C/NF ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that no one believe Energy/Mines Minister [PER Khelil  ] 's claims to know nothing of the investigation . 
Most believe [PER Khelil  ] exercised a guiding hand over [ORG Sonatrach  ] operations . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that his conversations with industry insiders had pointed to a cousin of the minister known only as [PER Hemche  ] who was a close adviser to former CEO [PER Meziane  ] . 
His sources believed [PER Hemche  ] was a key decision-maker , although [PER Meziane  ] did the signing . 
Early last December , [PER Hemche  ] reportedly abruptly retired and took up residence in [LOC Lugano  ] , [LOC Switzerland.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Ambassador noted that [LOC Algiers  ] is swirling with speculation about the political background of this and other scandals affecting several government ministries and public enterprises . 
Some believed it was a logical outcome of President [PER Bouteflika  ] 's oft-stated commitment to attack corruption . 
Most , however , interpret the [ORG DRS  ] move against high-level [ORG Sonatrach  ] officials -- who all owed their jobs to [MISC Bouteflika-confidant  ] [PER Khelil  ] -- as the military 's retaliation via the [ORG DRS  ] against the civilian control over it that [PER Bouteflika  ] had imposed since his reelection to a second term in 2004 . 
Comment ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The investigation against the leadership of the company that finances over half the country 's budget and produces 98 percent of its export revenue has shocked the country and generated rampant speculation about the political motivations behind it . 
In a country where power relationships and processes are opaque , speculation is as rife as hard evidence is scarce . 
A visiting analyst of a leading [LOC U.S.  ] risk analysis firm told [ORG Poloff  ] the week of January 31 , for example , that all his contacts believe the [ORG DRS  ] shaped the investigation to send a message to [PER Bouteflika  ] , either that he should allow relatives of leading generals a greater slice of the economic pie , or that [PER Bouteflika  ] 's western [MISC Algerian  ] " clan " should cede power back to the military ( which many regard as dominated by eastern [MISC Algerians  ] ) , or simply that the civilian-dominated authority should restore more behind-the-scenes influence to the military . 
Despite this theory and others we have heard , we see no hard evidence for any particular political interpretation . 
What is certain is that the alleged infraction and sums involved in this corruption case may only represent the tip of an iceberg -- which was precisely the point of an open letter to the [ORG DRS  ] published by a former [ORG Sonatrach  ] VP January 30 in the [MISC French  ] language daily " [ORG El Watan  ] . 
" That article urged the [ORG DRS  ] to look into a long list of much large [ORG Sonatrach  ] operations , including spot market sales to a handful of select customers connected to senior members of the power structure . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] risk analyst 's sources were certain the [ORG DRS  ] planted this article as a further warning to civilian authority. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) This case is the latest in a series of corruption investigations that started to surface with increasing frequency since last spring and which are now competing with indignation over [ORG TSA  ] measures and [LOC Algeria  ] 's failed bid to win the [MISC African Cup of Nations  ] football tournament for the main headlines in the daily press . 
Two of the larger cases already underway are alleged wrongdoing in the construction of the [ORG East-West Highway  ] and in the awarding of fishing licenses to [MISC Turkish  ] companies . 
Others involve state-controlled telephone operator [ORG Algerie Telecom  ] , [ORG BRC  ] ( mentioned previously ) , and the [ORG National Bank of Algeria  ] . 
Few cases have yet produced a trial or conviction , helping harden the widespread view that leading public officials continue to enrich themselves with impunity at public expense . 
With [ORG DRS  ] " commissars " believed present in virtually every public company or ministry front office , senior officials are said to be worried that every visitor , especially non-Algerians , is duly noted and reported . 
[ORG DRS  ] files , already swollen with decades of political and personal financial dirt on practically all notable [MISC Algerians  ] , are said to be growing fatter with information on suspicious business dealings or allegations of special favors . 
The big question no one can answer definitively is whether [PER Bouteflika  ] is orchestrating this anti-corruption blitz , as PM [PER Ouyahia  ] has publicly claimed and as would be consistent with [PER Bouteflika  ] 's longstanding intention , or is its ultimate target . 
His silence , noted by the press , has only fueled the speculation .
