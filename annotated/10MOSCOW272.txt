<code><pre>Friday , 05 February 2010 , 15:09 C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 [PER MOSCOW  ] 000272 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 02/05/2019 TAGS PGOV , PREL , PINR , KDEM , RS SUBJECT: [PER PUTIN  ] STILL HOLDING THE REINS FOR 2012 ELECTION REF: A. [LOC MOSCOW  ] 199 [PER B. MOSCOW  ] 175 [ORG Classified By: Political Minister  ] Counselor [PER Susan Elliott  ] for reasons 1 .4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] While supporters of [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Dmitriy Medvedev  ] are pushing him to establish himself as a stronger tandem member ( ref A ) , many political experts increasingly believe that no matter who becomes president in 2012 , the road to the presidency still runs through Prime Minister [PER Vladimir Putin  ] . 
Medvedev’s personal relationship with [PER Putin  ] , lack of a party foundation , and a small pro-Medvedev bureaucratic cadre limit his ability to be reelected without [MISC Putin’s  ] consent . 
With the election not until 2012 , wildcards such as political instability , health concerns , or a major economic decline could change the tandem equation , but experts perceive that no matter whether [PER Putin  ] , [PER Medvedev  ] , or someone else becomes President in 2012 , [PER Putin  ] will have the final word . 
End Summary. ---------------------------------- [PER Putin  ] Will Decide 2012 , Eventually ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Experts across the political spectrum continue to speculate who is most likely to become president in 2012 , with every credible scenario reduced to whether [PER Putin  ] wants to return to the presidency . 
Most contacts cite [MISC Putin’s  ] desire to control the political sphere as his main rationale for returning . 
Director of the [ORG Center for the Study of Elite  ] , United [LOC Russia  ] member , and [LOC Kremlin  ] adviser [PER Olga Kryshtanovskaya  ] told us that [PER Putin  ] was a “hostage to the system he had built.” She told [ORG Ekho Moskvy  ] radio on January 19 that all signs suggested that [PER Putin  ] would return in 2012 . 
General Director of the [ORG Agency for Political and Economic Communication  ] [PER Dmitriy Orlov  ] told us January 15 that [PER Putin  ] would “undoubtedly” return as president because he wanted to remain in control of [LOC Russia  ] from the more prestigious seat in the [LOC Kremlin  ] . 
He had stepped aside in 2008 merely to avoid unsavory comparisons to authoritarian leaders in [MISC Russia’s  ] backyard . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that [PER Putin  ] often arranged to have the question of his possible return in 2012 asked in public formats because he wanted to return to the presidency . 
He added that [MISC Putin’s  ] KGB background precluded him from trusting anyone with a no-Putin-strings-attached presidency. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The vast majority of our contacts suggested that unless [PER Medvedev  ] quickly did something drastic , the decision on 2012 would not be made until shortly before the election . 
In the lead up to the previous presidential election in 2008 , [PER Putin  ] kept his decision not to run quiet until the last moment . 
Delaying the descision would prevent undermining [PER Medvedev  ] in the public sphere , or either of them among the elite. ------------------------------------- [PER Medvedev  ] Avoiding Destabilizing Moves ------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Medvedev’s unilateral routes to reelection become narrower as he avoids taking destabilizing steps , such as firing senior [PER Putin  ] loyalists or changing the political system . 
This in turn increases his dependency on [PER Putin  ] to endorse him for another term . 
While pundits such as [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] are optimistic that [PER Medvedev  ] has time to build a large contingent of powerfully placed supporters , others increasingly view Medvedev’s close personal relationship with [PER Putin  ] as inhibiting his ability and inclination to initiate a dispute over control of the bureaucracy or reform of the political system . 
To emphasize her view that [PER Medvedev  ] relies on [MISC Putin’s  ] bureaucracy , [PER Kryshtanovskaya  ] said in her [ORG Ekho Moskvy  ] interview that only 2 of the top 75 positions in government were held by [PER Medvedev  ] loyalists. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Medvedev’s defense of the current political system and ( widely believed fraudulent ) October elections during his January 22 [ORG State Council  ] speech ( ref B ) , moreover , disappointed those who had expected him to set a new course . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us January 29 that a year ago he thought [PER Medvedev  ] was more likely to be reelected , but after the [ORG State Council  ] speech he viewed [PER Putin  ] as the frontrunner . 
The speech had convinced him that [PER Medvedev  ] had failed to garner elite or popular support away from [PER Putin  ] , or create a loyal bureaucratic team or political party . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] privately told us February 4 that [PER Putin  ] was likely to return as president because [PER Medvedev  ] had not built the political institutions necessary for him to be reelected . 
He gave [PER Medvedev  ] until the end of 2010 to establish pro-Medvedev political institutions , but seriously doubted that [PER Medvedev  ] , by way of [ORG First Deputy Presidential Administration  ] Chief [PER Vladislav Surkov  ] , would overhaul [MISC Russia’s  ] political party system. --------------------------------------------- - Election Tied to [MISC Putin’s Perception of Control  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Regardless of his lack of informal levers of power , [PER Medvedev  ] could return to the presidency if [PER Putin  ] thought that he could manage [LOC Russia  ] from a post other than the presidency . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] gave [PER Medvedev  ] a 70 percent chance of being “reselected” if stability persisted over the next two years . 
The decision , she said , was [MISC Putin’s  ] , and depended on his perception of being able to control [ORG Russia’s  ] political-economic system and protect his financial interests . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that [PER Putin  ] does not want to return to the [LOC Kremlin  ] , but needed to be in a position of control . 
He might be able to do that , much like he has done since 2008 , as Prime Minister . 
[PER Putin  ] , however , needed to ensure that he was positioned to crush anyone who might initiate de-Putinization , or suggest that [PER Putin  ] had a hand in unsavory deeds , such as the murder of journalists or the 1999 apartment bombings. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) While no one with whom we have spoken knows [PER Putin  ] and Medvedev’s future plans , [PER Medvedev  ] recently responded to a question on his possible career path . 
While not indicative of the future , [ORG KROS  ] public relations President and former [ORG Presidential Administration  ] deputy [PER Sergey Zverev  ] told us that he had heard that a journalist had asked [PER Medvedev  ] an off-the-record hypothetical question in late January about what position [PER Medvedev  ] would want if he were no longer President . 
After thinking it over for a moment , [PER Medvedev  ] responded Head of the [ORG Constitutional Court  ] or Prime Minister. -------------------------- [PER Putin  ] in the [ORG Driver’s Seat  ] -------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Zverev  ] stated that [PER Putin  ] is in total control of the situation and that he had no other option than to remain in a position of power , but not necessarily as president . 
[PER Zverev  ] said that [PER Putin  ] would be president if he wanted the position . 
If [PER Putin  ] wanted [PER Medvedev  ] to be president , then [PER Medvedev  ] would be president . 
[PER Medvedev  ] did not necessarily need to have a bureaucratic team or party support if [PER Putin  ] decided to endorse [PER Medvedev  ] , because [PER Putin  ] would remain in a position of power where he could defend his interests and support [PER Medvedev  ] when needed . 
A recent joke circulating in [LOC Moscow  ] emphasized Zverev’s point: [PER Medvedev  ] sits in the driver’s seat of a new car , examines the inside , the instrument panel , and the pedals . 
He looks around , but the steering wheel is missing . 
He turns to [PER Putin  ] and asks: “Vladimir [PER Vladimirovich  ] , where is the steering wheel ? ” [PER Putin  ] pulls a remote control out of his pocket and says , “I’ll be the one doing the driving.” -------- Comment: -------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG Russia’s  ] bicephalous ruling format is not likely to be permanent based on [MISC Russian  ] history and current tandem dynamics . 
[PER Medvedev  ] and [PER Putin  ] work well together , but [PER Putin  ] holds most , and the best , of the cards in the tandem relationship . 
His return to the [LOC Kremlin  ] is not inevitable , but should things remain stable , [PER Putin  ] remains in a position to choose himself , [PER Medvedev  ] , or another person as [ORG Russia’s  ] next president . 
We should continue to engage where possible with [PER Putin  ] , who will continue to have a significant say in [MISC Russian  ] affairs for the foreseeable future , regardless of his formal position .
