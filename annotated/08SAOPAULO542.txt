Summary: <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's extensive [MISC Lebanese  ] [PER Diaspora  ] , the largest such community in the world , contains important , influential people who want to work with the [ORG USG  ] to help the cause of democracy in [LOC Lebanon  ] , a position made evident during the 9/24-26 visit of [PER Jared Cohen  ] ( [ORG S/P  ] ) and [PER Janine Keil  ] ( INR ) to [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
The visit also made clear that an appreciation of the local [MISC Lebanese  ] Brazilians' ties to their ancestral homeland strongly enhances our outreach to this influential local ethnic and economic group . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's [MISC Lebanese  ] community offers the possibility for a powerful " two-fer , " a local group that can reinforce [MISC Middle Eastern  ] democracy and that is influential , in its own right , in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] could become a model for Diaspora-mobilization for democracy in the [LOC Middle East  ] and [MISC Muslim  ] outreach in [LOC WHA  ] , adding important transnational aspects to our efforts at [ORG Transformational Diplomacy  ] . 
End Summary . 
[PER Cohen  ] and [PER Keil  ] Visit [LOC Sao Paulo  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Jared Cohen  ] ( S/P ) and [PER Janine Keil  ] ( INR ) visited [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] September 24-26 . 
They met with a variety of representatives -- [PER Christian  ] , [MISC Jewish  ] and [MISC Muslim  ] -- of [LOC Brazil  ] 's ethnic [MISC Lebanese  ] community . 
Among the [MISC Lebanese  ] [MISC Brazilians  ] who met [PER Cohen  ] and [PER Keil  ] were: [PER Joseph Sayah  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] 's Consul General ; [PER Sheik Jihade  ] Hamade of the [ORG World Assembly of Islamic Youth  ] ( [ORG WAMY  ] , [PER Sunni  ] ) ; [PER Berty Tawil  ] and [PER Ernesto Chayo  ] ( [ORG Banco Safra  ] ) ; [PER Alfred Cotait  ] ( Secretary of [LOC International Relations  ] for [LOC Sao Paulo City Hall  ] ) ; [PER Guilherme Mattar  ] ( [PER Cotait  ] 's Chief of Staff ) ; [PER Suheil Yammout  ] ( Head of the [MISC Lebanese  ] March 14 Movement and representative of [PER Saad Hariri  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] ) ; [PER Mohammed Zoghby  ] ( President of the [ORG Muslim Federation of Brazil  ] ) ; [PER Fouad Naime  ] ( journalist , editor of the magazine " Carta do [MISC Libano  ] , " representative of Phalangist and [MISC Lebanese  ] Forces ) ; [PER Salim Schahin  ] ( businessman and banker , participant in the [ORG Abraham Path Project  ] ) ; and [PER Naji Nahas  ] ( businessman ) . 
The flagship event of the trip was a cocktail organized by the [MISC Lebanese  ] Consul General ( [ORG CG  ] ) at his residence on 9/25 , where he invited a variety of [MISC Lebanese-Brazilian  ] interlocutors to meet with [PER Cohen  ] and [PER Keil  ] . 
This was supplemented by a visit to a local mosque as well as a series of private meetings with [ORG Banco Safra Officials  ] , leaders of the [ORG Future Movement  ] , and [MISC Lebanese-Brazilian  ] businessman and billionaire [PER Naji Nahas  ] at the latter 's residence . 
The [ORG Community: Broad  ] , [ORG Deep  ] , Diverse , and [PER Selectively Engaged  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's [MISC Lebanese  ] [PER Diaspora  ] reflects the diversity of its country of origin . 
As a rough guide , [LOC Brazil  ] 's ten million persons of [MISC Lebanese  ] descent ( many of them second and third generation ) are 90 percent [PER Christian  ] . 
The remaining ten percent is 9-to-1 Sunni/Shia . 
According to those interviewed , [LOC Brazil  ] 's ethnic [MISC Lebanese  ] are divided along both generational and religious lines into three general groups: --The [ORG Shia  ] ( approximately 160,000 according to the [MISC Lebanese  ] [ORG CG  ] ) . 
The [MISC Lebanese-Brazilians  ] interviewed ( none of whom were [ORG SAO PAULO  ] 00000542 002.3 OF 005 [ORG Shia  ] ) said that the [ORG Shia  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] are usually first-generation immigrants not well-integrated into [MISC Brazilian  ] society . 
They generally speak little [MISC Portuguese  ] and sympathize with [ORG Hezbollah  ] , likely even those who do not publicly voice their support for the group . 
The [ORG Shia  ] maintain a close partisan identification with [MISC Lebanese  ] politics and many intend to return . 
There are anecdotal reports , ( which have not been verified-NFI ) , that they receive financial help from the [MISC Iranian  ] Embassy in [LOC Brazil  ] , including funds distributed to young [ORG Shia  ] to start businesses. --The second , third , and fourth generation immigrants , majority March 14-oriented [MISC Christians  ] , but also a significant number of [PER Sunni Muslims  ] . 
( Note: The March 14 Movement or March 14 Alliance refers to [LOC Lebanon  ] 's 2005 [LOC Cedar Revolution  ] , when [MISC Lebanese  ] citizens opposed to [LOC Syria  ] 's occupation of their country rose up in protest against the occupiers following the assassination of former [MISC Lebanese  ] Prime Minister [PER Rafik Hariri  ] on 2/14/05 . 
End Note . 
) This group makes up the vast majority of the [PER Diaspora  ] . 
Beyond a shared hope for a peaceful and unified [LOC Lebanon  ] , they are not deeply involved in the particulars of [MISC Lebanese  ] politics . 
Those interviewed stressed the [PER Diaspora  ] 's spirit of integration , insisting the [MISC Lebanese  ] conflict 's ethnic divisions for the most part do not exist among [MISC Lebanese-Brazilians  ] . 
Their presence in [LOC Brazil  ] 's business and political life is extensive . 
Some of [LOC Brazil  ] 's most successful business and banking leaders hail from the [MISC Lebanese  ] community ( [ORG Safra Bank  ] ) as well as the country 's political lead ers ( [LOC Sao Paulo Mayor  ] [PER Gilberto Kasssab  ] is [MISC Lebanese  ] ; there are 35 members of the [ORG Brazil-Lebanon Parliamentary Friendship Group  ] ) . 
Interlocutors told us that " there is not a province in [LOC Brazil  ] " that does not have an ethnic [MISC Lebanese  ] elected to some office . 
This group , which includes descendants of original [MISC Lebanese  ] immigrants , may number into the millions and is the largest [MISC Lebanese  ] community in the world. --The third group is a subset -- really a leadership set -- of the broader [MISC Lebanese  ] community described above . 
It consists of very successful and well-connected business persons who are intimately familiar with [MISC Lebanese  ] politics . 
They are often emotionally stricken by the turmoil they see in their ancestral homeland , but have trouble identifying worthy projects to support [MISC Lebanese  ] democracy . 
Members of this leadership group reject [ORG Hezbollah  ] 's extremism and [MISC Syrian  ] and [MISC Iranian  ] interference in [LOC Lebanon  ] , but are also disappointed in the corruption that they say permeates all sides of [MISC Lebanese  ] politics . 
They also fear that the [LOC U.S.  ] will give up all hope for [MISC Lebanese  ] democracy and " abandon " the country . 
This last group proved most responsive to the [ORG Cohen/Keil  ] visit and expressed keen interest in learning more about [LOC U.S.  ] initiatives to support [MISC Lebanese  ] democracy and in how they could support such efforts . 
Engagement Not Across-the-Board , But Intense <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) While most [MISC Lebanese  ] [MISC Brazilians  ] keep [LOC Lebanon  ] 's divisions at arms-length , the leaders described above can be intensively engaged in the country . 
Several of our interlocutors communicate with [MISC Lebanese  ] political leaders regularly . 
President [PER Suheil Yamout  ] of the [ORG Future Institute  ] provided perhaps the most concrete example of intense selective engagement when he described his organizations " get out the vote " drive for [LOC Lebanon  ] 's March parliamentary elections to [PER Cohen  ] and [PER Keil  ] . 
The [ORG Future Institute  ] aims to fly some ten thousand [MISC Brazilian  ] citizens who also hold [MISC Lebanese  ] passports back to [LOC Lebanon  ] to vote this March , [ORG SAO PAULO  ] 00000542 003 OF 005 providing up to USD 10,000 in financial support to each one to make the trip . 
The [ORG Future Institute  ] also mentioned that a likely 50,000 [MISC Lebanese  ] will self-finance trips back to [LOC Lebanon  ] in the spring to participate in the March elections . 
They are coordinating with [PER Saad Hariri  ] ( son of the Prime Minister assassinated in 2005 , leader of the [MISC Lebanese  ] Future Movement ) to ensure that they maximize thes e votes in the right districts . 
Meeting participants estimated that there are up to one half-million [MISC Lebanese  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] who are eligible to hold [MISC Lebanese  ] passports and who could conceivably vote in that country 's elections . 
When asked , [MISC Lebanese  ] stakeholders explained that the vast majority of these are March 14 supporters . 
Pre-Polarization [ORG Lebanon Meets Brazil  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The bulk of the [MISC Lebanese  ] community in [LOC Brazil  ] contrasts with [LOC Lebanon  ] itself in the critical area of polarization . 
Where [LOC Lebanon  ] has become a synonym for religious/ethnic division and state breakdown , the older , second/third/fourth generation [MISC Lebanese  ] [MISC Brazilians  ] are a community noted for their openness , internal diversity , and tolerance . 
( The more recently-arrived [ORG Shia  ] do not fall under this umbrella . 
) This became evident throughout a series of meetings that featured local [MISC Lebanese  ] [MISC Christians  ] , [MISC Jews  ] and [PER Sunni Muslims  ] all conversing easily in fluent [MISC Lebanese  ] Arabic . 
Interlocutors attributed this to several factors: the basic tolerance that older [MISC Lebanese  ] , products of the pre-1970s [LOC Beirut  ] , have for one another ; the " melting pot " quality of [MISC Brazilian  ] culture , which emphasizes mixing and moderation , the reality that they all want to do business with one another ; and finally the conscious desire of the [MISC Lebanese  ] [MISC Brazilian  ] community not to import [LOC Lebanon  ] 's troubles into their community . 
Participants in our meetings were eager to tell the story of the successful [MISC Lebanese  ] [MISC Brazilian  ] " melting pot " back in the [LOC Middle East  ] and particularly in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
The [PER Diaspora  ] may have lessons for the homeland when it comes to teamwork and tolerance . 
Response Highly Positive , [PER But....  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The majority of [MISC Lebanese  ] [MISC Brazilian  ] interlocutors eagerly embraced the idea of coordinating engagement with [LOC Lebanon  ] with [ORG USG  ] efforts . 
The community manages large financial resources and appears more than willing to engage . 
That said , conversations revealed two intriguing elements that indicated frustration with the [LOC U.S.  ] and a possible need for more [MISC Muslim  ] outreach here in [LOC Brazil.  ] -At the 9/25 cocktail , [MISC Lebanese  ] [MISC Brazilian  ] interlocutors worriedly asked [PER Cohen  ] whether or not the [LOC U.S.  ] had " given up " on [MISC Lebanese  ] democracy ? 
Would the country be abandoned ? 
[PER Cohen  ] replied emphatically that this was not the case , that the President and the Secretary remained firmly engaged . 
Nonetheless , the participants' disquiet was evident along with their enthusiasm for engagement. -Our 9/25 visit to a local mosque was highly cordial . 
[PER Sheik Jihad Hassan  ] presented his group as non-political and eager for outreach . 
Nonetheless , during the visit , [PER Cohen  ] noted that the mosque uses the Salafist ( or more radical ) of two translations of the [MISC Koran  ] available . 
In addition , when asked about outside support for the mosque , the [PER Sheik  ] said that all financial help came " from the community , " an answer that appeared to point to the local communitym , but that seemed ambiguous in the face of the mosque 's ample resources for teaching and outreach . 
[ORG SAO PAULO  ] 00000542 004.3 OF 005 What Is To Be Done ? <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Cohen  ] discussed several concrete project ideas for [LOC Lebanon  ] with our interlocutors , who responded enthusiastically . 
Among the ideas put forward: -Filming a documentary about teamwork and tolerance among [MISC Christians  ] , [PER Muslims  ] and [MISC Jews  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] 's [MISC Lebanese  ] community as a tolerance model that could be broadcast in [LOC Lebanon  ] and in the [LOC Middle East  ] , possibly by [ORG Al-Jazeera Network.  ] -Creating a [ORG Brazilian-Lebanese Business Council  ] that could undertake high profile efforts to provide youth employment and internships back in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
[PER Cohen  ] specifically mentioned the " Teach for [LOC Lebanon  ] " initiative as an example that could maybe benefit from this. -Developing a version of the " Birthright " Program ( under a different name ) that reinforces the connections [MISC American Jews  ] feel for [LOC Israel  ] by funding travel to [LOC Israel  ] . 
[MISC Lebanese  ] youth overseas could be encouraged to travel and even work in [LOC Lebanon.  ] -Translating interviews with [ORG USG  ] Officials on [LOC Lebanon  ] into [MISC Portuguese  ] for the [MISC Brazilian  ] [MISC Lebanese  ] community . 
Likewise , [ORG USG  ] officials who work on [LOC Lebanon  ] could give interviews in [MISC Brazilian  ] media. -Arranging for the [ORG Lebanon-Brazil Parliamentary Friendship Group  ] to visit [LOC Washington DC  ] and meet [LOC U.S.  ] officials overseeing our policy toward [LOC Lebanon.  ] -Setting up meetings for the [MISC Lebanese  ] CG in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , [PER Joseph Sayah  ] , to discuss our policies with [LOC Washington  ] officials when he next travels to the [LOC United States.  ] -The vast majority of interlocutors suggested that [PER Cohen  ] make a follow up visit to [LOC Brazil  ] at some point in the near future . 
Comment: The [ORG Multiple Benefits  ] in Diaspora-Engagement <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The most important opportunity to emerge from [PER Cohen/Keil  ] 's visit was the possibility that [LOC Brazil  ] 's [MISC Lebanese  ] community could support [ORG USG  ] efforts to build a democratic and independent [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
Community members expressed enthusiasm for a range of cultural and economic initiatives and appeared ready to self-finance efforts which would work in coordination with the [MISC USG.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) As potentially important as the [MISC Lebanese  ] [PER Diaspora  ] might be for [LOC Lebanon  ] , its members remain a strong and influential group here in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Engaging them , particularly some of their most influential leaders , on an ancestral homeland issue near and dear to their hearts only deepened our already good contacts with this critically important local group and some of its most prominent members. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The [MISC Lebanese  ] [PER Diaspora  ] provides a bridge to more moderate [MISC Muslim  ] groups that would be excellent targets for outreach. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Lastly , [LOC Brazil  ] 's diversity and the strong home-country connections of some of its [MISC Lebanese  ] [PER Diaspora  ] could make it a testing ground for both Diaspora-engagement strategies and [MISC Muslim  ] outreach in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
[ORG SAO PAULO  ] 00000542 005.3 OF 005 Action Request: <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) As a point of departure for efforts to engage [LOC Middle Eastern  ] communities in [LOC Brazil  ] , Post would be interested in models that other posts -- particularly the [LOC UK  ] , [LOC France  ] , [LOC Belgium  ] , [LOC Netherlands  ] , [LOC Spain  ] , and [LOC Germany  ] -- have employed successfully for [MISC Muslim  ] outreach . 
These would be good points of departure for our own efforts to engage [LOC Middle Eastern  ] communities in [LOC Brazil.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) This message was coordinated with and cleared by the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy , [LOC Brasilia  ] .
