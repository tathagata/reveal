He said , however , that they would not be harmed , that he would abide by the humanitarian assurances provided to the [ORG USG  ] , and that he would not forcibly remove anyone to [LOC Iran  ] - even those suspected of crimes - but that they could not remain in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[ORG LTG Austin  ] noted vast improvements in the security environment over the last year , commenting that the [MISC GOI’s  ] operation in [LOC Basra  ] last March was a pivotal moment in [LOC Iraq’s  ] history . 
The [ORG PM  ] remarked that “maintaining victory is much more difficult than achieving victory , ” noting that [MISC Iraqi  ] security forces must adapt to new threats posed by smaller clandestine terrorists cells and emphasized that intelligence would be key to this end . 
In response to the [MISC CDA’s  ] query about payments due to General Electric for power generation contracts , the [ORG PM  ] said that the contracts would be paid even if it had to come out of their own salaries . 
[ORG LTG Austin  ] expressed his gratitude to the [ORG PM  ] for resolving budget problems related to payment of the [ORG SOI  ] , to which the [ORG PM  ] responded that the [ORG COR  ] is playing political games with the budget .

End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) [ORG LTG Austin  ] informed the [ORG PM  ] that General [PER Odierno  ] was in [LOC Jordan  ] and asked about the [MISC PM’s  ] recent trip to [LOC Australia  ] . 
The [ORG PM  ] said that the trip was productive , but noted that it was very long . 
The position of the [MISC Australian  ] government is a very good one , he reiterated. ---------------------------- An Evolving Security Threat ---------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [ORG LTG Austin  ] reminded the [ORG PM  ] that this time last year they were in [LOC Basra  ] , adding that “so much has changed since then.” [LOC Basra  ] was a defining point in [LOC Iraq’s  ] history , he told the [ORG PM  ] . 
The [ORG PM  ] agreed , commenting that “maintaining victory is much more difficult than achieving victory.” The [ORG PM  ] said that “they ( insurgents/terrorists ) are still out there , ” but they have lost control of the cities and have become “gangs” that move from one area to the next. “We need to build our intelligence capability to track these clandestine gangs.” The time of armed confrontations ( battles ) is over , he said. “We have to adjust our forces to counter this new threat and intelligence will play a key role in this , ” [PER al-Maliki  ] warned . 
He questioned whether or not existing plans or strategies , e.g. , focusing on checkpoints , are still applicable. “We have to evolve our forces to compensate for the changing security environment and emerging threats , ” he said. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [ORG LTG Austin  ] said that the [ORG PM  ] and General [PER Odierno  ] are of Q4 . 
( S ) [ORG LTG Austin  ] said that the [ORG PM  ] and General [PER Odierno  ] are of a like mind on this matter . 
He remarked that the [MISC Iraqi  ] Police ( [ORG IP  ] ) would need to assume a greater responsibility for internal security , while the [LOC Iraq  ] Army ( [ORG IA  ] ) would focus on external threats . 
The [ORG PM  ] quickly responded that the [LOC IA  ] plays a critical role in ongoing security operations and would continue to do so , particularly in light of the drawdown of [LOC U.S.  ] forces. “There is no substitute for the [LOC IA  ] in a security role , ” he said. “I don’t want to risk withdrawing the [LOC IA  ] , particularly in light of the drawdown of [LOC U.S.  ] forces , ” he reiterated . 
Perhaps , he said , this will happen after we ensure that the insurgents and al-Qaida [LOC Iraq  ] ( [ORG AQI  ] ) will not come back. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) The [ORG PM  ] said that “we must continue to develop the police.” They need weapons and equipment and additional training in combating terrorism . 
There have also been some problems within the [ORG IP  ] , noting the recent arrest of a “gang” within the passport office that was taking bribes for counterfeiting passports ( photo-substitution ) of suspected former [ORG Ba’ath Party  ] members . 
He said that the police taking bribes is a serious problem that undermines security in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00000791 002 OF 003 “Terrorists can use our passports to move around freely with absolute anonymity.” [ORG LTG Austin  ] responded that the [ORG IP  ] is twice as large as the [LOC IA  ] and that it would take some more time to develop , acknowledging that the [LOC IA  ] is far more capable at present . 
[ORG PM  ] al-Maliki responded that the [ORG IP  ] would eventually assume responsibility for internal security , allowing the [LOC IA  ] to focus on external threats. -------------------------------- Politics and the Budget Process -------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) LTG [PER Austin  ] thanked the [ORG PM  ] for his help with the [ORG SOI.  ] “I thought that there would be more problems with them getting paid , but it now seems to have been resolved , ” [ORG LTG Austin  ] remarked . 
The [ORG PM  ] said that the [ORG COR  ] may have been playing political games with the budget and that he had taken money from the MOI’s budget to pay the salaries of the [ORG SOI  ] . 
The [ORG COR  ] is trying to sabotage our efforts , he said . 
The [ORG CDA  ] took this opportunity to ask about the [MISC GOI’s  ] plan to fund this year’s payments to [ORG GE  ] on the contract signed last year for electrical generators . 
The [ORG PM  ] assured the [ORG CDA  ] that the payments would be made , even if the money had to come from their own salaries . 
The [ORG PM  ] said that “we can not sacrifice electricity ( referring to the [ORG GE  ] contract ) , or security , of which the [ORG SOI  ] are an important part , even if we have to cut the budget in other areas.” --------------------------------- Former [ORG SOI  ] Leader [PER Adel Mashadani  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) Updating the [ORG PM  ] on the status of former [ORG SOI  ] leader [PER Adel Mashadani  ] ( REF B ) , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
The [ORG PM  ] responded that he is running out of patience on this matter and that it had already taken too long . 
He said that Mashadani’s presence is a direct challenge to the [ORG GOI  ] . 
He said that “we must develop a plan that minimizes collateral damage but has some acceptable risk , ” comparing the situation to [LOC Basra  ] . 
This is a big problem , the [ORG PM  ] said. “I will have our special forces and intelligence units work out a strategy and present it to you , we don’t want to wait too long , ” al-Maliki advised . 
[ORG LTG Austin  ] said that they are already working with [ORG Iraqi Special Forces  ] units in the area , noting they had recently collaborated to arrest two suspected [ORG AQI  ] operatives in [LOC Fadhel.  ] “We will work with your forces to develop a plan , but we want to be cautious , ” [ORG LTG Austin  ] said. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) The [ORG PM  ] was insistent that we not wait too long , fearing that [PER Mashadani  ] might escape or that the [ORG GOI  ] would be perceived as being complicit in Mashadani’s criminal activity , or worse , that the [ORG GOI  ] is incapable of acting against him . 
The [ORG PM  ] said that we have gone after tougher and stronger targets than him , adding that we should not fear him . 
[ORG LTG Austin  ] reiterated that he only wants to minimize casualties but that he understands the [ORG PM’s  ] concerns. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) Turning to the [ORG CDA  ] , the [ORG PM  ] asked about the arrival of Ambassador [PER Hill  ] . 
The [ORG CDA  ] said that Ambassador [PER Hill  ] will have confirmation hearings in the [ORG Senate  ] on March 25 and that , hopefully , he would arrive in [LOC Iraq  ] sometime in April . 
The [PER Qhopefully  ] , he would arrive in [LOC Iraq  ] sometime in April . 
The [ORG PM  ] asked the [ORG CDA  ] if she foresaw any problems . 
She responded that some [MISC Senators  ] had expressed concern with Ambassador Hill’s lack of experience in the [LOC Middle East  ] and over his negotiations with [LOC North Korea  ] . 
She said that Ambassador [PER Hill  ] had already met with [MISC Senators  ] [PER McCain  ] and [PER Graham  ] to address such concerns . 
She expressed optimism that he would be confirmed by the [ORG Senate  ] , noting that he was one of the [MISC Department’s  ] most accomplished diplomats . 
The [ORG PM  ] said that he had discussed Ambassador [PER Hill  ] with President [PER Obama  ] when they last spoke and that President [PER Obama  ] said that Ambassador [PER Hill  ] “had his complete confidence” and that he is “the right man for the job.” The [ORG PM  ] told the [ORG CDA  ] that “we welcome him to [LOC Iraq.”  ] ------------------------------------------- Oil Reform Proposals and Direct Contracts ------------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) The [ORG CDA  ] asked the [ORG PM  ] about the status of the reform proposals from the oil symposium hosted by Deputy Prime Minister [PER Barham Saleh  ] in early March . 
She said that it was a [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00000791 003 OF 003 good sign that the government had formalized the symposium’s conclusions into recommendations for government decision , and asked if the package would need only COM agreement or would also have to go to the [ORG COR  ] for approval . 
The [ORG PM  ] said no , he does not intend for the reform proposals to go to the [ORG COR  ] and that he would do everything to avoid this , commenting that the [ORG COR  ] would “take us into a political maze , ” which was completely unnecessary. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) [PER Sadiq Rikabi  ] , political advisor to the [ORG PM  ] , asked the [ORG PM  ] to inquire about the [MISC USG’s  ] position on direct contracts with international oil companies . 
The [ORG PM  ] noted that he is in favor of direct contracts , in order to avoid the delays inherent in a bidding process . 
The [ORG PM  ] said he is currently in negotiations with [ORG Chevron  ] to develop various oil fields , to include a cross-border oil field with [LOC Iran  ] ( NFI ) . 
The [ORG PM  ] claimed that [ORG Chevron  ] had told him that it had already raised the issue of a cross-border development with [LOC Tehran  ] as well . 
( Note: We have no independent confirmation of this ; end note . 
) The [ORG PM  ] asked the [ORG CDA  ] about the political feasibility of such a deal involving a [LOC U.S.  ] firm working both sides of a cross-border field , given current USG policies toward [LOC Iran  ] . 
The [ORG CDA  ] noted that [LOC U.S.  ] law on sanctions would apply , but added that the Administration was reviewing its policies on [LOC Iran  ] . 
[ORG PM  ] al-Maliki said that he prefers to go with [ORG Chevron  ] on the deal ; however , he remarked that if [LOC U.S.  ] rules prevent [ORG Chevron  ] from doing this project , he would approach a non-American firm. -------------------------------------- [ORG PM’s Response  ] to Demarche on the [LOC MEK  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) The [ORG CDA  ] informed the [ORG PM  ] that she had been directed by [LOC Washington  ] to deliver a demarche on [LOC Camp Ashraf  ] ( REF A ) . 
The [ORG CDA  ] delivered the points in the demarche , without interruption by the [ORG PM  ] . 
The [ORG PM  ] then expressed some frustration and questioned why the [ORG GOI  ] had to act so responsibly towards a organization determined to be a terrorist group by both [LOC Iraq  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] . 
He noted that this created daily problems within the [ORG GOI  ] . 
He asked the [ORG CDA  ] to try to understand the very difficult situation that the [ORG GOI  ] was in. “It is not because of [LOC Iran  ] , ” he said. “We have great internal pressures to resolve this matter.” The [ORG PM  ] noted that he had been around for the last 20 years and knows very well who the [LOC MEK  ] are and what they have done . 
The [ORG PM  ] complained “they ( [LOC MEK  ] ) are at the al-Rasheed hotel , meeting with [ORG COR  ] members and conspiring against the [ORG GOI.”  ] He said that [LOC Iran  ] had asked how the [ORG GOI  ] could support cross border military actions by [LOC Turkey  ] against the [ORG PKK  ] , but not allow [LOC Iran  ] to take similar action against the [LOC MEK  ] at [LOC Camp Ashraf  ] . 
He added that he is very concerned about a message delivered by [LOC Iran  ] that it would attack the [LOC MEK  ] at [LOC Camp Ashraf  ] if no action was taken soon . 
Additionally , al-Maliki asked , given the drawdown of [LOC U.S.  ] bases , whether the [LOC U.S.  ] could help the [ORG GOI  ] to use one of the transferred facilities - far from the [MISC Iranian  ] border - as a new location for the [LOC MEK  ] . 
[ORG LTG Austin  ] told the [ORG PM  ] that he will look into this possibility. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( S ) The [ORG PM  ] reassured the [ORG CDA  ] that he would not take any action against the [LOC MEK  ] . 
He said that he would abide by the humanitarian assurances provide by the [ORG GOI  ] to the USG . 
He told the [ORG CDA  ] that the [ORG GOI  ] would not remove any of the [LOC Camp Ashraf  ] residents to any country , including [LOC Iran  ] , where they would be harmed. “We will not forcibly return any of them to Qwould be harmed. “We will not forcibly return any of them to [LOC Iran  ] , even those suspected of crimes , ” al-Maliki stated . 
But , “they must understand that [LOC Iraq  ] is not their home.” The [ORG CDA  ] noted that the [ORG European Union  ] had delisted the [LOC MEK  ] as a foreign terrorist organization and that we were working with other countries to encourage them to relocate the [LOC MEK  ] . 
[ORG PM  ] al-Maliki said that he met with [ORG ICRC  ] President [PER Jacob Kellenberger  ] on March 18 who had also raised this issue with him and that they had discussed this issue at length .
