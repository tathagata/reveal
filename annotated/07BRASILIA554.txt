( [ORG SBU  ] ) Discussion was cordial , centering on the need for the third countries invited to agree to the plan before it is announced at [LOC Camp David  ] . 
All players emphasized future private industry involvement , the possibility of increased job creation and investment , and the end goal of making ethanol into a globally-traded commodity . 
Responses from the representatives from the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] and [LOC Haiti  ] representatives were cautiously positive - though neither were able to provide a definitive commitment . 
End Summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Vargas  ] emphasized that the [ORG MOU  ] would help: a ) spur global , regional , and local cooperation ; b ) establish , via the [ORG International Biofuels Forum  ] ( [ORG IBF  ] ) patterns and norms that will lead to the commoditization of ethanol ; c ) develop and exchange new technology ; d ) job and income creation ; e ) foreign direct investment ; and e ) a reduction of greenhouse gases . 
He also emphasized the importance of what he called a " symmetry of understanding " for all countries involved . 
All of these points were well received by Ambassador [PER Manuel Morales Lama  ] of the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] and Minister-Counselor [PER Jean-Baptiste Reynold Leroy  ] of [LOC Haiti  ] . 
[PER Vargas  ] also discussed the recent [ORG IBF  ] meeting in [LOC New York  ] as an example of other countries' interest in the topic of biofuels development . 
He emphasized that the [ORG IBF  ] is an intergovernmental operation with the goal of significant private sector involvement. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Morales Lama  ] indicated that the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] already has a keen interest in sugar cane and in establishing a free trade zone , but that he could not definitively provide his country 's acceptance of the [MISC USG-GOB  ] plan without first consulting his president . 
[PER Leroy  ] expressed some trepidation as the sugar cane industry in [LOC Haiti  ] already had failed ostensibly due to falling prices . 
[PER Kipman  ] indicated that the goal would be the development of the sugar cane market in [LOC Haiti  ] 's economically depressed north . 
[LOC U.S.  ] [ORG DCM  ] reemphasized that the future of the ethanol market is very promising , and that the [ORG IBF  ] and bilateral [MISC USG-GOB  ] cooperation will go a long way toward bolstering and sustaining sugar cane prices in the third countries under discussion .

As [PER Vargas  ] stated , " it would not be proper to indicate that countries are part of the plan without first asking them whether they want to be involved . 
" He indicated that he looked forward to the [LOC Dominican Republic  ] 's and [LOC Haiti  ] 's official replies , as well as to hear from the two nations which could not attend the meeting .
