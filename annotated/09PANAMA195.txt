2008 [LOC PANAMA  ] 851 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Stephenson  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) Under the lights of TV cameras in a packed auditorium , three consortia , including one led by [MISC American  ] firm [ORG Bechtel  ] , submitted bids to the [ORG Panama Canal Authority  ] ( [ORG ACP  ] ) on March 3 to build the 3.3 billion USD set of locks for the already under-construction third lane of the [LOC Panama  ] Canal . 
The bid submissions end a year-long and often contentious licitation process between the [ORG ACP  ] and four pre-qualified consortia ( one of which did not submit a bid ) that was considered transparent by the [MISC Panamanian  ] people and to the consortia. --------------------------- BID SUBMISSION PRESENTATION --------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) During a March 3 televised presentation including representatives of three of the four pre-qualified consortia , government officials , the diplomatic corps , President [PER Torrijos  ] , and [ORG ACP  ] officials , [ORG ACP  ] Administrator [PER Aleman  ] proudly accepted three bids for the 3.3 billion USD third set of locks contract , the centerpiece of the overall 5.25 billion dollar expansion project . 
The [ORG ACP  ] also submitted its own " price proposal " in a sealed envelope , which sets the upper limit of what the [ORG ACP  ] will pay . 
In full view of representatives from the consortia , the public , and the press , the lead [ORG ACP  ] Contracting Officer , a Notary Public , and [ORG ACP  ] Inspector General theatrically moved a sealed box containing the price proposals by motorcade from the [ORG ACP  ] auditorium to a vault in the [ORG National Bank of Panama  ] . 
The three technical proposal bids were immediately brought to a secure , controlled access building . 
The [ORG ACP  ] plans to publicly retrieve the price proposals once the technical proposal evaluations are completed in June or July . 
A new administration takes office July 1. ------------ TRANSPARENCY ------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) After the presentation , [ORG ACP  ] Board Chairman said , " The [ORG ACP  ] has created an airtight process , " and the [ORG ACP  ] " is firmly committed to an open , fair , rigorous and transparent bid process . 
" Supporting the rhetoric , [ORG ACP  ] officials have taken steps throughout this process to emphasize the transparency of their actions and the fairness of the bidding process . 
Every milestone has been accompanied by a public meeting and all licitation documents were available on the [ORG ACP  ] website . 
Recently , the [MISC GOP  ] publicized the criteria for choosing a winner by holding a press conference , taking out paid full-page advertisements in leading [MISC Panamanian  ] newspapers , holding conference calls with interested parties , publishing official licitation documents , and meeting with the diplomatic corps . 
The consortia and associated companies have not criticized the transparency of the process to Embassy . 
While there have not been complaints about transparency , the consortia have complained about the large number of changes to the process . 
See reftels. ---------------------- BID EVALUATION PROCESS ---------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) The winner will be determined by a " best value " methodology in which each consortium will receive a combined score based 55% on the technical proposal and 45% on the price proposal . 
The [ORG ACP  ] Inspector General , contract auditor [ORG Deliotte  ] , and the lead [ORG ACP  ] contracting official will supervise the fifteen member [ORG ACP  ] technical evaluation team as they score the bid proposals in isolation . 
The three technical proposal bids were immediately brought to a secure , controlled access building . 
According to the [ORG ACP  ] , the documents are not permitted to leave the building and the computer systems in the building do not communicate beyond the walls of the building . 
If the technical evaluation team needs additional technical expertise , forty specialized engineering experts who are on retainer can be immediately brought to [LOC Panama  ] to advise the group . 
All participants have signed confidentiality agreements . 
The three bids will receive a numeric score based upon criteria published in licitation documents . 
When the [ORG Technical Committee  ] finishes its scoring , the [ORG ACP  ] plans another televised presentation in which it will announce the technical scores , and then retrieve and open the price proposals . 
Immediately , the technical and price scores will be apportioned for a combined score , and a winner will be publicly declared. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) There are two known future sources of possible turbulence in the process . 
1 ) [PER Sacyr  ] , a [MISC Spanish  ] company that leads a consortium , is considered by press accounts and the other consortia to be technically bankrupt . 
If [PER Sacyr  ] wins , it may not pass the final financial viability review and/or may not be able to meet the contractual obligation of a 400 million USD surety bond . 
This outcome may jeopardize the viability of current bid process . 
As reported in reftel E , the concern over [PER Sacyr  ] 's financial situation dates to Fall of <a id='par2008' href='#par2008'>¶</a>2008 . 
2 ) The winner 's price proposal may be higher than [ORG ACP  ] 's " price proposal " ( [PER Partida Asignada  ] ) , which is the maximum price the [ORG ACP  ] will pay for the locks contract . 
Under this condition , the [ORG ACP  ] would negotiate the price with the winning consortium . 
The likely outcome would be a descoping of major tasks from the locks contract and then reclassifying these tasks as capital improvements not part of the expansion . 
Thus , the money would be out of the regular [ORG ACP  ] budget . 
If the [ORG ACP  ] and the winning consortium do not come to an agreement , then the [ORG ACP  ] will request new price proposals from the three consortia that submitted bids . 
If this action does not produce a low enough price proposal , the [ORG ACP  ] will start a new licitation process or raise the amount it is will to pay . 
( By [MISC Panamanian  ] law , the [ORG ACP  ] can only spend 5.25 billion USD on the [ORG Expansion Project  ] that includes many major contracts besides the locks contract . 
If the 5.25 billion USD is exceeded , the [ORG National Assembly  ] must approve the extra needed money . 
) -------------------------------------- [MISC FRENCH  ] CONSORTIUM DID NOT SUBMIT A BID -------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Over the past six months , [ORG ACP  ] officials , representatives from other consortia , and representatives from program manager [ORG CH2MHill  ] , informed Embassy officials repeatedly that the [MISC French  ] consortium was in disarray and that most consortium members were not working on the proposal . 
See reftel [PER E. These  ] reports proved true when the [MISC French  ] consortium did not submit the bid package . 
As a result of failing to submit a bid package , the [MISC French  ] consortium will not share in the $15 million stipend set aside for the losing consortia. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The submission of the bids ended a year-long and often contentious licitation process that endured 24 amendments , 51 meetings between the consortia and the [ORG ACP  ] to primarily discuss the shifting of technical and financial risk from the consortia back to the [ORG ACP  ] , and tension between the Minister of the [ORG Canal  ] , the Administrator of the [ORG Canal  ] , and the [ORG Canal Expansion Program Manager  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] company [ORG CH2MHill  ] . 
Past major sources of turbulence included: 1 ) Originally the [MISC European  ] consortia wanted the [ORG ACP  ] to accept sovereign guarantees of their financial health . 
Now the consortia must post bonds . 
2 ) At first , the [ORG ACP  ] placed all risk on the consortia ; the risk level is now more balanced . 
3 ) In the past month , the [ORG ACP  ] added the requirement that the winner of the contract must recertify their financial well-being due to the world economic downturn . 
To work toward successful [ORG ACP  ] solutions , the Embassy actively engaged [ORG ACP  ] interlocutors at multiple levels to resolve issues. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The reftels outline in detail the [ORG ACP  ] brinkmanship to maximize the amount of risk on the consortia while promoting an environment for competitive bids . 
While the number of amendments and meetings illustrate an initial lack of knowledge in running a multi-billion dollar construction project and a sometimes antagonistic manner to attempt to obtain advantage over the consortia , the [ORG ACP  ] designed and implemented a process that was transparent to the [MISC Panamanian  ] people and to the consortia . 
The desire for transparency may be rooted in the professional pride of the [ORG ACP  ] and a [MISC Panamanian  ] desire to show that without help from others , they can run a first world organization and process . 
One business rationale for the level of transparency could well be to mitigate the effects of the inevitable litigation from the losing consortia .
