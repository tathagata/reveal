Reasons: 1.5 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: Embassy Madrid warmly welcomes your visit . 
Your presence provides an excellent opportunity to reinforce our message on [LOC Iran  ] financial sanctions with both government and private sector representatives . 
( Note: Your schedule has been sent via e-mail to staff . 
) You will also have an opportunity to discuss terrorism finance matters with [MISC Spanish  ] officials . 
End Summary. ------------------------ [LOC IRAN  ] FINANCIAL SANCTIONS ------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Perhaps one of the most important things you can do during your calls is to stress that pressure to isolate [LOC Iran  ] economically is likely to increase . 
While the [MISC Spanish  ] government agrees with the [LOC U.S.  ] objective of preventing [LOC Iran  ] from building a nuclear weapon , the [MISC Spaniards  ] are more comfortable with the carrot and engagement side of the relationship with [LOC Iran  ] . 
This is why it is going take hard work to secure [MISC Spanish  ] support for the ratcheting up of sanctions , but if additional sanctions are approved by the [ORG UN  ] and/or the [ORG EU  ] , [LOC Spain  ] will implement those sanctions. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC Spanish  ] trade with [LOC Iran  ] is not large . 
In 2007 , [LOC Spain  ] exported [MISC USD  ] 693 million to [LOC Iran  ] ( 0.24 percent of [MISC Spanish  ] exports to the world ) and imported [MISC USD  ] 2.4 billion from [LOC Iran  ] ( 0.55 percent of [MISC Spanish  ] imports from the world ) , mostly petroleum products . 
There are no [MISC Spanish  ] data on [MISC Spanish  ] investments in [LOC Iran  ] in 2006 or 2007 . 
There was no registered [MISC Iranian  ] investment in [LOC Spain  ] in 2006 or 2007 either . 
The other big [ORG EU  ] economies exported considerably more to [LOC Iran  ] . 
In 2007 , [LOC France  ] exported [MISC USD  ] 2 billion , the [LOC UK  ] [MISC USD  ] 801 million , [LOC Italy  ] [MISC USD  ] 2.5 billion , and [LOC Germany  ] almost [MISC USD  ] 5 billion . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's base position is that it implements UNSCRs 1737 and 1747 , and we have no reason to disbelieve that it does so . 
With respect to [ORG UNSCR  ] 1803 , there is reporting from [LOC Brussels  ] indicating that [LOC Spain  ] moved slowly with respect to approving the [ORG EU  ] 's so-called autonomous designation list , but ultimately [LOC Spain  ] approved. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [LOC Spain  ] will likely support [ORG EU  ] recommendations with one important exception: [MISC Spanish  ] officials have told us that they will not accept restrictions on investment in the oil & gas sector . 
This is somewhat ironic because [ORG Repsol  ] has decided not to pursue the development of the [MISC South Pars  ] gas field 's block 13 , although [ORG Repsol  ] ( and [ORG Shell  ] ) have not ruled out the prospect of working on latter phases of the project . 
Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] has discussed [LOC Iran  ] on several times with [ORG Repsol  ] CEO [PER Antonio Brufau  ] . 
Your meeting with [PER Brufau  ] is an opportunity to thank him for not pursuing the [MISC South Pars  ] deal , and to to encourage the company to continue to desist from investing in [LOC Iran  ] 's oil and gas sector. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Deputy Treasury Secretary [PER Kimmitt  ] and Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] have talked directly to [MISC Spanish  ] banks about being very careful about their activities in [LOC Iran  ] . 
EconCouns talked to [ORG Banco Sabadell  ] management as well about its Iran-related activity . 
Our sense is that [MISC Spanish  ] banks are , in fact , monitoring their activities carefully . 
[ORG Ministry of Industry  ] , [ORG Tourism  ] and Trade Secretary of State [PER Silvia Iranzo  ] , chairs an inter-ministerial committee looking into possible dual-use exports to [LOC Iran  ] . 
We think that [LOC Spain  ] analyzes possible dual-use issues carefully . 
With respect to export credit policy , Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] and EconCouns have talked about [LOC Iran  ] with [MISC Spanish  ] officials . 
[LOC Spain  ] takes the position that [MISC Spanish  ] policy is set in the [ORG OECD  ] 's export credit committee . 
Whatever [LOC Spain  ] does with respect to export credits is likely to be coordinated with the [ORG EU  ] . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] government is aware that in addition to talking to the government , we also talk directly to private sector actors about [LOC Iran.  ] -------------- [ORG TERROR FINANCE  ] -------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG GOS  ] is efficient in imposing freezes and sanctions related to [ORG UN  ] and [ORG EU  ] designations but does not implement [ORG E.O.  ] 13224 designations . 
The [ORG GOS  ] has the authority to do so under Law 12/2003 , but chooses instead to apply standard judicial procedures when dealing with non-UN or [ORG EU  ] designated entities . 
Nonetheless , the [ORG GOS  ] actively complies with our requests to investigate designated entities and is very efficient and discreet in conducting searches for funds from individuals and organizations listed in pre-notifications . 
In recent years , no such related funds have been found in [MISC Spanish  ] accounts. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG SEPBLAC  ] is [LOC Spain  ] , s [ORG FIU  ] with a primary mission to receive , analyze , and disseminate suspicious and unusual transaction reports . 
[ORG SEPBLAC  ] works in close coordination with the [ORG Directorate General  ] of the [ORG Ministry of Economy and Finance  ] ( [ORG MEF  ] ) , the entity with the authority to freeze assets and impose sanctions . 
[ORG SEPBLAC  ] and the [ORG Directorate General  ] are overseen by an inter-ministerial policy committee referred to as the [ORG Commission  ] for the [ORG Prevention of Money Laundering and Monetary Offenses  ] ( [ORG CPBCIM  ] ) chaired by Second Vice President and Secretary of Economy [PER Pedro Solbes.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) As an organization , [ORG SEPBLAC  ] has grown by almost 50 percent in the past year to about 60 employees . 
Included in its ranks are members of the [LOC Guardia Civil  ] , [ORG National Police  ] , and [MISC Spanish  ] Customs who cooperate with each other and supplement the information provided by reporting parties . 
Press reports indicate that the number of [MISC Suspicious Activity Reports  ] filed by banks has increased substanitially in recent years. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) We have scheduled an appointment with [ORG SEPBLAC  ] for you . 
The reason is that if you find it opportune , we recommend you ask re: the status of a reported [ORG SEPBLAC  ] investigation into [PER Barakat Yarkas  ] 's possibly financing terror finance activities from his jail cell . 
( Note: [PER Yarkas  ] was convicted for membership of a terrorist organization and for conspiring to commit terrorist acts . 
He was suspected of being involved with individuals linked to the September 11 , 2001 attack . 
) On April 28 , [LOC Spain  ] 's leading daily , [ORG El Pais  ] , published a story alleging that [PER Yarkas  ] was financing terrorist groups from his jail cell , and that there was an outstanding judicial investigation against [PER Yarkas  ] involving a new terrorism finance charge ( s ) against him . 
You may wish to ask [ORG SEPBLAC  ] whether there is , in fact , an ongoing investigation into [PER Yarkas  ] 's possible activities . 
We have not been able to confirm whether there is an investigation through other channels . 
( Note: The [ORG National Security Council  ] has been interested in designating [PER Barakat Yarkas  ] for several years , and we have urged the [MISC Spanish  ] government to do so . 
For reasons still not entirely clear to us , the [MISC Spanish  ] government has desisted from designating [PER Yarkas  ] . 
) ---------------------- DOUBLE TAXATION TREATY ---------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) We are providing the following information for you as background should the issue arise in connection with your [MISC American  ] Chamber of [ORG Commerce  ] ( [ORG AmCham  ] ) lunch . 
The Chamber is seeking to convince the [ORG GOS  ] to amend the 1990 double taxation treaty between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] . 
The biggest change would allow [LOC U.S.  ] corporations that sell stock in their subsidiaries in [LOC Spain  ] for the purpose of corporate reorganizations to be taxed on their capital gains in the [LOC U.S.  ] , rather than at the [MISC Spanish  ] 25 percent rate . 
[ORG Procter & Gamble  ] , [ORG IBM  ] , and [ORG GM  ] are particularly interested in this change . 
The [ORG U.S. Treasury Department  ] 's [ORG Office of International Tax Counsel  ] is , in principle , willing to renegotiate the treaty but only if the [MISC Spanish  ] government indicates strong interest and if [MISC American  ] firms lobby [ORG Treasury  ] through the [ORG National Foreign Trade Council  ] and the [ORG Tax Executive Institute  ] . 
With respect to the latter , we have encouraged [ORG AmCham  ] to have their members lobby through these organizations , but this has not taken place yet . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] government is aware of the [ORG AmCham  ] 's interest in amending the treaty , but so far our sense is that not enough business interest has been demonstrated to convince the [MISC Spanish  ] government to pursue this matter . 
The [ORG AmCham  ] is currently organizing a campaign to get major [MISC CEOs  ] to write the government about this topic. ---------------- [ORG Political Update  ] ---------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The general elections in March 2008 were a hard fought affair that saw President [PER Zapatero  ] 's Socialist party ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) defeat [PER Mariano Rajoy  ] 's [ORG Popular Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) . 
The [ORG PSOE  ] , which needed 176 seats in the 350-seat [ORG Congress  ] to gain an absolute majority , won 169 seats or about 44 percent of the vote . 
The [ORG Popular Party  ] won about 40 percent of the vote , which translated into 155 seats . 
Smaller regional parties from [LOC Catalonia  ] , [LOC Galicia  ] , and the [ORG Basque Region  ] all received enough votes to gain congressional representation but lost seats to the two main political parties , the [ORG PSOE  ] and [ORG PP  ] . 
Voter turnout nationwide was over 75 percent . 
The slowing [MISC Spanish  ] economy , the terrorist threat from both the [MISC Basque  ] terrorist group [ORG ETA  ] and [MISC Islamic  ] extremist groups , regional autonomy , and immigration were all major topics during the election . 
Foreign affairs did not play a major role in the campaign , but the [ORG PSOE  ] reminded voters that it removed [LOC Spain  ] 's troops from an unpopular war in [LOC Iraq.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Since winning reelection , [PER Zapatero  ] has named a new government , created new ministries and combined others . 
[PER Zapatero  ] 's new cabinet notably has more female ministers ( 9 ) than male ( 8 ) , including [LOC Spain  ] 's first female Minister of Defense , [PER Carme Chacon  ] . 
Two new ministries have been added: The [ORG Ministry of Equality  ] and the [ORG Ministry of Science and Technology  ] . 
The [ORG Ministry of Agriculture  ] has taken on the additional responsibility of [ORG Marine Affairs  ] and has been combined with the [ORG Ministry of the Environment  ] . 
The [ORG GOS' First Vice  ] President for the Presidency , Second Vice President for Economy and Finance , and Ministers of [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] and Interior remain the same. --------------- [ORG Economic Update  ] --------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [LOC Spain  ] has had one of [LOC Europe  ] 's fastest-growing economies over the last decade . 
It has the world 's eighth largest economy and is the world 's second largest tourism destination and eighth auto manufacturer . 
Its GDP per capita is expected to pass [LOC Italy  ] 's in 2010 . 
The next year or two will be more difficult . 
A housing boom that spurred growth for several years ended abruptly in 2007 . 
Construction has slowed dramatically , and unemployment has risen to almost 10 percent . 
Inflation is higher than the [ORG EU  ] average , which hurts competitiveness. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [LOC U.S.  ] investment has long been important to the [MISC Spanish  ] economy ( more so than bilateral trade ) , and [LOC U.S.  ] firms employ over 220,000 [MISC Spaniards  ] . 
The growth of [MISC Spanish  ] multinationals and the strong [MISC Euro  ] have led to a surge of [MISC Spanish  ] investment in the [LOC U.S.  ] in the last few years . 
In 2007 , [LOC Spain  ] was the fourth largest foreign investor in the [LOC U.S.  ] , with particular emphasis in banking , toll road construction , and renewable energy . 
[MISC Spanish  ] firms now own wind farms in at least 14 [LOC U.S.  ] states , as well as solar power and biofuels plants. ----------------------------------- [ORG Diplomatic Cooperation and Security  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) U.S.-Spain relations were seriously damaged by President [PER Zapatero  ] 's decision soon after his election in 2004 to abruptly withdraw [MISC Spanish  ] forces from [LOC Iraq  ] . 
However , over the last several years , both countries have made a concerted and successful effort to rebuild the relationship based on strong mutual interests in counter-terrorism , fighting narcotics trafficking and organized crime , and rapidly expanding economic ties . 
The real bilateral story is found in novel initiatives such as the [MISC HSPD-6  ] agreement we signed last September to facilitate the sharing of information between our national counter-terrorism authorities . 
Following the March 11 , 2004 train bombings , [LOC Spain  ] remains a target of [MISC Islamic  ] extremists . 
[ORG Al-Qaeda  ] leaders often call for the recapture of the medieval " [PER Al Andalus  ] , " and the recent uncovering of a cell allegedly sympathetic to [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] and operating out of [LOC Barcelona  ] has shown the [MISC Spanish  ] that this threat is not an idle one. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Spain  ] is no stranger to terrorism , having fought the domestic [MISC Basque  ] terrorist group [ORG ETA  ] for almost 40 years . 
[MISC Spanish  ] political leaders are currently showing a united face , as - for the first time in several years , representatives of all political parties in the [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Congress  ] issued a joint statement on March 15 announcing that all would work together to defeat [ORG ETA  ] . 
Interior Minister [PER Rubalcaba  ] said in late March that " we are entering a long cycle of violence " with [ORG ETA  ] and , according to [MISC Spanish  ] media , the [ORG Spanish National Intelligence Center  ] ( [ORG CNI  ] ) has informed the government that [ORG ETA  ] has no plans to negotiate for at least the next 18 months . 
The [MISC Basque  ] terrorist group has been active in recent months , detonating explosives on several occasions , including one that resulted in the death of a [ORG Spanish Civil Guard  ] Officer on May 14 . 
[ORG ETA  ] also assassinated a former [ORG PSOE  ] city councilman on March 7 ( two days before national elections ) , and two [ORG Spanish Civil Guard  ] officers in [LOC France  ] in December 2007 . 
[MISC Spanish  ] security forces are concerned that [ORG ETA  ] has established new bomb manufacturing centers and techniques that will enable the organization to launch more attacks. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Narcotics trafficking is another area of common concern and excellent cooperation . 
[MISC Spanish  ] authorities acknowledge that [MISC Andean  ] cocaine is a serious problem here , and [MISC Colombian  ] trafficking organizations are active in [LOC Spain  ] . 
Money laundering is another serious issue . 
We are eager to find ways to increase bilateral cooperation and to encourage [LOC Spain  ] to engage more aggressively with law enforcement authorities in key [MISC Latin American  ] countries . 
[LOC Spain  ] has recently taken steps in this direction . 
Within the last two months , the Director General of [LOC Spain  ] 's Police and [ORG Civil Guard  ] traveled to [LOC Colombia  ] to sign a cooperation agreement to fight drug trafficking and its related crimes through increased personnel and information exchange. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Spain  ] , second only to the [LOC U.S.  ] in terms of investment , is actively engaged in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
In addition to cultural and historical ties , [LOC Spain  ] shares our interest a strong democratic and free market institutions in the region . 
Regarding [LOC Cuba  ] , we share with [LOC Spain  ] the objective of a peaceful transition to democracy but differ markedly on how to achieve this end . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's socialist government has opted for engagement , claiming it can encourage regime elements who want change . 
We take every opportunity to remind the [MISC Spanish  ] that the [MISC Cuban  ] regime is only interested in survival and that the [MISC Cuban  ] dissidents need and deserve the active and visible support of democracies everywhere. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Spanish  ] military cooperation matters . 
The bases of [LOC Rota  ] and [LOC Moron  ] are strategic hubs , midway between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] planes and ships account for around 5,000 flights and 250 port calls a year in [LOC Spain  ] . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] military is pro-U.S. and pro-NATO . 
We need to keep this relationship strong . 
[LOC Spain  ] has nearly 800 personnel in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and runs a provincial reconstruction team in [LOC Badghis  ] province . 
[LOC Spain  ] has contributed some 150 million [MISC Euros  ] in [MISC Afghan  ] reconstruction funds . 
Planning is underway to allow the [MISC Spanish  ] to train and equip an [MISC Afghan  ] Army company , which we hope will be a prelude to the training and equipment of a full battalion . 
[LOC Spain  ] has nearly 1,100 troops with [ORG UNIFIL  ] in [LOC Lebanon  ] and about 700 in [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
On [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Spain  ] has contributed $22 million to the [ORG Basrah Children  ] 's Hospital and a further $28 million in development funding for [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's total commitment to the [LOC Iraq  ] Compact was USD 225 million . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] says that [LOC Spain  ] has disbursed all of its pledge except for its concessional loans , which are pending completion of project proposals . 
It also has provided through [ORG UNHCR  ] over 800,000 euros for refugee and displaced persons relief in [LOC Jordan  ] and [LOC Syria  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] is an active participant in [MISC EU-Iraq  ] negotiations on an economic cooperation agreement that would provide additional funding for training and development activities. ------------------- [ORG Security Assessment  ] ------------------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) In general , [LOC Spain  ] is safe . 
However , [LOC Madrid  ] , [LOC Barcelona  ] and other large cities in [LOC Spain  ] attract a large number of criminals and pickpockets and frequent incidents of crime of opportunity against the unwary do occur . 
It is best to carry only essential items including a photocopy of your passport 's photo page . 
Visitors can protect themselves against crime by being street-smart , alert and aware of their surroundings . 
Travelers are encouraged to review the most recent Worldwide Caution issued by the [ORG Department of State  ] . 
As the [ORG Department of State  ] continues to develop information on any potential security threats to [MISC Americans  ] overseas , it shares credible threat information through its [ORG Consular Information Program  ] documents , available on the [MISC Internet  ] at http://travel/state.gov . 
Additional information regarding safety and security in [LOC Spain  ] is available on the [ORG U.S. Department of State  ] 's website ( www.embusa.es ) .
