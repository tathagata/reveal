( C ) Key Points: -- On January 31 , Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the [LOC Middle East  ] Dr. [PER Colin Kahl  ] met with [ORG Major General Mohammad  ] al-Assar , Assistant to the Minister of Defense , [ORG Major General Ahmad Moataz  ] , Chief of the [MISC American Relations Branch  ] , and [ORG Major General Fouad Arafa  ] , Consultant to the Military [ORG Intelligence Department  ] . 
-- During the meeting , [PER Kahl  ] discussed the need to incorporate a military strategy that included symmetrical and asymmetrical capabilities , pursuing a capabilities-based approach to security assistance , FMF issues , balance of power in the region , nuclear weapons in the [LOC Middle East  ] , current [LOC U.S.  ] policy towards [LOC Iran  ] , [MISC Egyptian  ] efforts to counter-smuggling and interdict illicit weapons destined for [LOC Gaza  ] , and the release of advanced weapons systems . 
-- The [MISC Egyptian  ] defense officials continued to stress that the threats facing the [LOC United States  ] were different from [LOC Egypt  ] 's , and [LOC Egypt  ] needs to maintain a strong conventional military to counter other armies in the region. --------------------------------------------- ---------------------- -------------- [LOC Egypt  ] 's Current Security Concerns and [ORG National Defense Policy  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------------------- --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) During the 31 January 2010 meeting , al-Assar constantly referred to the numerous unstable security situations in the [LOC Middle East  ] that influenced [MISC Egyptian  ] military doctrine to include: [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Syria  ] , [LOC Lebanon/Hezbollah  ] , [LOC Palestine/HAMAS  ] , [LOC Yemen  ] , [LOC Sudan/Darfur  ] , [LOC Somalia  ] , [LOC Eritrea  ] , Piracy issues , [LOC Algeria  ] , and al-Qaida . 
Al-Assar emphasized that ethnic conflict throughout the region and border issues could have a negative impact on [MISC Egyptian  ] sovereignty at any time. al-Assar commented that he did not expect any of these security situations to resolve in the near future ; instead , he believed the list would grow even larger. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) al-Assar outlined [LOC Egypt  ] 's [ORG National Defense Policy  ] which he stated was based on a defensive , capabilities-based strategy instead of threat-based . 
The number one priority is the defense of [MISC Egyptian  ] land and the [LOC Suez Canal  ] . 
Other goals include: preparedness for unexpected threats such as terrorism ; the achievement of regional stability ; interoperability with [LOC Egypt  ] 's military partners ; and a leading role for [LOC Egypt  ] in the region . 
Al-Assar provided the [MISC Egyptian  ] military 's list of regional threats/concerns such as [LOC Nile Basin  ] water rights and the conflicts in [LOC Darfur  ] and southern [LOC Sudan  ] . 
He commented that one never knows what [LOC Libya  ] might do and that it was essential that [LOC Egypt  ] maintain the balance of power on its eastern border . 
He reiterated the fact that [LOC Israel  ] possesses unconventional weapons and sophisticated conventional weapons , which creates a regional imbalance and contributes to instability . 
He noted that stability in the region cannot be attained without balance of power . 
He stated that the [MISC Egyptian  ] military doctrine did not intend to gain an edge on any other country in the region or cause offense to anyone. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Al-Assar complained that the [MISC Egyptian  ] military sometimes felt pressured by the [LOC United States  ] to reform its doctrine and capabilities to counter asymmetric threats . 
He emphasized that the threats faced by the [LOC United States  ] were different from [LOC Egypt  ] 's . 
He commented that tanks and aircraft were necessary to fight asymmetrical threats as well . 
He referred to General Patreaus' [LOC Sadr City  ] battle plan against extremists and noted that this plan depended on the use of tanks and aircraft in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
He called on Dr. [PER Kahl  ] to educate [ORG Congress  ] about [LOC Egypt  ] 's military needs and not put limits on the numbers of aircraft and tanks . 
He noted that the [MISC Egyptian  ] military preferred to purchase its weapons and armaments from the [LOC United States  ] , but that [LOC Egypt  ] 's national security was a red line and they could go elsewhere if they had to. --------------------------------------------- ---- Security Assistance and Modernization --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Dr. [PER Kahl  ] commented that the [LOC U.S.  ] military had learned some hard lessons about the promises and limits of technology during the first years of the war in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Kahl  ] stated that there are no longer any purely conventional military conflicts in the world and the last large conventional war was the [MISC First Gulf War  ] . 
The current challenge for modern armies is to find the right balance between conventional and irregular forces and doctrines to fight what Secretary Gates refers to as " hybrid wars . 
" [PER Kahl  ] commented that the [LOC U.S.  ] lost more tanks in [LOC Iraq  ] to roadside bombs than in battles with [MISC Iraqi  ] tanks . 
He also noted that information technology in the modern war was just as valuable as military equipment in order to have the ability to rapidly communicate and assess the environment. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Dr. [PER Kahl  ] reiterated that a modern military should rely on quality equipment rather than a large quantity of outdated armaments , and should place a greater emphasis on the scope of its aggregate capabilities vice number of high-end weapons platforms. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG Major General Fouad Arafa  ] interjected during the discussion to note that the spirit of the Camp [PER David  ] accord was that there would be a 2:3 balance between [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Israel  ] 's security assistance . 
[LOC Egypt  ] 's role was to keep a certain balance of power in the region that would not allow other parties to go to war . 
[LOC Egypt  ] had fulfilled this role faithfully for the last 30 years. al-Assar added that the current ratio of 2:5 was a violation of the Camp [PER David  ] ratio. --------------------------------------------- -------- [LOC Yemen  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , and the Weapons [ORG Free Zone  ] --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) al-Assar noted that [LOC Iran  ] effectively interfered in the internal affairs of [LOC Lebanon  ] , [LOC Palestine  ] , and [LOC Iraq  ] . 
He commented that [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear ambitions would significantly change the balance of power in the region and was contributing to further regional instability and intensifying the conflicts . 
Al-Assar stated that [LOC Egypt  ] views [LOC Iran  ] as a threat to the region and its conventional and unconventional weapons would only increase the instability in the region . 
Al-Assar commented that if [LOC Iran  ] was successful in obtaining nuclear weapons , it would only encourage other countries in the [LOC Middle East  ] to pursue the same path. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Al-Assar brought up President [PER Obama  ] 's pledge to pursue a Nuclear Weapons [ORG Free Zone  ] ( [ORG NWFZ  ] ) in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
He called on the [LOC United States  ] to not ignore the [MISC Israeli  ] nuclear program . 
He stated that [LOC Israel  ] 's nuclear program only gave [LOC Iran  ] justification for creating its own nuclear weapons . 
If [LOC Iran  ] obtained nuclear weapons , it would only embolden [LOC Iran  ] to use [ORG Hezbollah  ] and [ORG HAMAS  ] with impunity. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Dr. [PER Kahl  ] stated that ultimate goal for the [LOC United States  ] was the creation of a [ORG NWFZ  ] in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
However , it was not possible to draw strict parallels between [LOC Iran  ] 's acquisition of nuclear weapons and other [ORG Middle Eastern  ] countries . 
[LOC Iran  ] is the only country in the world that was currently threatening to wipe an entire country off the map , and [LOC Tehran  ] reinforced this message through destabilizing activities pursued by its proxies in the region . 
The goal of a [ORG NWFZ  ] in the [LOC Middle East  ] could take 10-20 years to achieve ; however , the international community could not wait 20 years to address [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program and needed to figure out ways to slow down the clock on the [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear ambitions. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [ORG Major General Fouad Arafa  ] joined the conversation stating that [LOC Iran  ] was using the various [LOC Middle East  ] conflicts for its own ambitions and was gaining power because of its interference in the internal affairs of the [ORG Middle Eastern  ] countries . 
It was essential to cut [LOC Iran  ] 's connections and influence in the regional conflicts in [LOC Lebanon  ] , [LOC Israel  ] , and [LOC Palestine  ] in order to decrease the level of influence [LOC Iran  ] enjoyed in the region . 
[LOC Iran  ] was effectively using [MISC Arab  ] public opinion to advance its goals . 
Dr. [PER Kahl  ] agreed and reinforced the need for continued [MISC Arab  ] engagement on this issue to ensure a " unified front " on the part of the international community. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Kahl  ] stated that the [LOC United States  ] had reached out to [LOC Iran  ] in 2009 through unconditional talks and that this was meant as a test of [LOC Iran  ] 's willingness to prove that its nuclear program was for peaceful civilian use . 
[LOC Iran  ] , however , had not seized this opportunity to resolve international concerns . 
[PER Kahl  ] speculated that [MISC European  ] countries and even [LOC Russia  ] , which would not have supported the sanctions in the past , were now ready to increase pressure on [LOC Iran.  ] ------------------------- Counter-smuggling ------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Dr. [PER Kahl  ] extended his appreciation for [LOC Egypt  ] 's enhanced counter-smuggling efforts in the past year , but expressed concern over recent increases in smuggling activity into the [LOC Gaza  ] strip and [ORG HAMAS'  ] efforts to rearm . 
Dr. [PER Kahl  ] emphasized that the [LOC United States  ] understands that this is an especially sensitive political issue internally in [LOC Egypt  ] , as well as in the region . 
Dr. [PER Kahl  ] noted that the [LOC United States  ] was looking forward to the positive completion of the [MISC BTADs  ] project and thanked the [MISC Egyptian  ] Military for its agreement-in-principle to sign a follow -on statement for future [MISC BTADs  ] support as this provided an opportunity for further cooperation on counter-smuggling and border security . 
He also underscored the importance of targeting smuggling networks and their financiers in [LOC Sudan  ] and the [MISC Sinai-not  ] just their activities. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Dr. [PER Kahl  ] renewed Secretary of [LOC Defense Gate  ] 's offer to assist the [MISC Egyptian  ] military in expanding its counter-smuggling efforts on the [MISC Sudanese  ] border and the [LOC Red Sea  ] region. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Al-Assar stated that the smuggling tunnels threatened the national security of [LOC Egypt  ] ( highlighting [ORG HAMAS  ] specifically ) and that " terror " could come to [LOC Egypt  ] via these tunnels . 
[LOC Egypt  ] has spent approximately $40 million to purchase the steel for the underground wall on the [LOC Gaza  ] border , and [LOC Egypt  ] was paying the cost of this wall in terms of public opinion both within [LOC Egypt  ] and the region . 
He noted that once the wall was in place , the time would come to pressure [LOC Israel  ] to take responsibility for the humanitarian situation in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
Dr. [PER Kahl  ] reaffirmed that in all of engagements with [LOC Israel  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] officials strongly encourage [LOC Israel  ] to open crossings into [LOC Gaza  ] to allow humanitarian goods to cross , and that [LOC Egypt  ] 's focus must be affixed on thwarting the movement of illicit weapons into the strip. ------------- Homework ------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Dr. [PER Kahl  ] encouraged [LOC Egypt  ] to sign a [ORG Communications Electronics Security Agreement  ] ( [ORG CESA  ] aka [ORG CISMOA  ] ) with the [LOC Unites States  ] , which would pave the way for the transfer of advanced technology to [LOC Egypt  ] and greatly increase interoperability . 
Al-Assar stated that [LOC Egypt  ] had " its reasons to delay a decision on a [ORG CISMOA  ] . 
" He noted that thousands of [MISC Egyptian  ] military officers have participated in training and education programs in the [LOC United States  ] and learned about [LOC U.S.  ] technology and strategy . 
He commented that the younger officers are frustrated with the delay in obtaining political release for more advanced [LOC U.S.  ] technology . 
Specifically , al-Assar referred to [MISC TOW2B  ] and [LOC JAVELIN  ] , which he commented had already been released to other countries . 
Al-Assar noted that a [ORG CISMOA  ] was not a condition for obtaining these systems , but instead they were held up due to a " third party " . <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Al-Assar commented that [LOC Egypt  ] was in negotiations with [LOC Iraq  ] to supply the [MISC Iraqi  ] military with approximately 140 tanks , which are manufactured at the [LOC FMF  ] tank facility . 
He noted that the [MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] was awaiting the [LOC United States  ] positive response to its request for approval of the transfer . 
Dr. [PER Kahl  ] noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] was considering this request and would provide a response soon. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) Al-Assar encouraged Dr. [PER Kahl  ] to convince the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] that [LOC Egypt  ] was worth more than $1.3 billion a year . 
Dr. [PER Kahl  ] mentioned that [LOC Egypt  ] receives the second largest amount of assistance in the world , and that during these difficult financial times in the [LOC United States  ] , it was unlikely that annual flow of [LOC FMF  ] would increase . 
He did however reassure the [MISC Egyptian  ] officials that the [ORG USG  ] would continue to advocate for current levels of [LOC FMF  ] and push back on any attempts to condition those funds .
