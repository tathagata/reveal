[LOC Prince Khalid  ] was very happy and the relationship between the businessman and the prince was cemented . 
( Note: The prince’s old palace has since become a university .

( [ORG S  ] ) The next day [PER Prince Khalid  ] phoned this businessman and invited him to meet the [MISC Prince of Wales  ] .

The businessman ultimately declined the invitation to meet with the two princes . 
When he received a phone call and a summons , the next day , from [PER Prince Khalid  ] , he was frightened .
