( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: A Foreign Corrupt [ORG Practices Act  ] case involving malfeasance by [LOC U.S.  ] oil technology and services firm [ORG Baker Hughes  ] in [LOC Kazakhstan  ] will soon be settled , revealing details of bribes paid by the firm’s local representatives . 
[ORG Baker Hughes  ] representatives are in [LOC Astana  ] to brief Prime Minister [PER Masimov  ] on the case before it becomes public , in hopes of limiting the negative impact on the firm’s ability to work in [LOC Kazakhstan  ] . 
In order to minimize the damage from the case to [LOC U.S.  ] investors and the bilateral relationship , post believes it would be helpful to inform the [MISC Kazakhstani  ] government that the [LOC U.S.  ] government authorized [ORG Baker Hughes’  ] representatives to brief them in advance of the settlement , and to share the text of the decision once it is issued . 
End summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador met with [PER Alan R. Crain  ] , Senior Vice President and General Counsel of [ORG Baker Hughes Incorporated  ] , and Amb . 
[PER Beth Jones  ] , Executive Vice President of [ORG APCO Worldwide  ] , on April 10 in [LOC Astana  ] to discuss a Foreign Corrupt [ORG Practices Act  ] ( [ORG FCPA  ] ) case involving [ORG Baker Hughes’  ] work in [LOC Kazakhstan  ] . 
[PER Crain  ] and [PER Jones  ] informed the Ambassador that they would meet with Prime Minister [PER Masimov  ] later that day to brief him on the upcoming [LOC U.S.  ] court decision in the case . 
They had met with [PER Masimov  ] on January 9 to inform him that legal proceedings were underway in the [LOC U.S.  ] , and now planned to share the details . 
They stated that the [ORG Department of Justice  ] and the [ORG SEC  ] had authorized both meetings. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Crain  ] told the Ambassador that a former employee of [ORG Baker Hughes  ] filed a report with the [ORG SEC  ] in August 2003 detailing alleged malfeasance in several overseas subsidiaries , including [MISC Kazakhstan.XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Four separate incidents were discovered during the internal investigation , the second of which is the basis of the legal proceedings currently underway in the [LOC U.S.:  ] -- 1998-1999: [ORG Baker Hughes  ] retained an agent at the direction of an executive of [ORG KazTransOil  ] and made commission payments of $1.1 million to the agent from July 1998 to April 1999. -- 2000-2003: An agent was hired in September 2000 for an oil services contract for the [LOC Karachaganak  ] field . 
The company retained the agent at the urging of [PER Roy Fearnley  ] , a [ORG Baker Hughes  ] employee in [LOC Kazakhstan  ] and a citizen of the [LOC UK  ] . 
The company was awarded the [LOC Karachaganak  ] contract in October 2000 . 
From May 2001 to November 2003 , the company made commission payments to the agent’s [LOC London  ] bank account of $4.1 million. -- 2002: The company authorized payments for an option to lease a parcel of land . 
It was aware that an executive of the [MISC Kazakhstani  ] national oil company could have an interest in the company that owned the land , and that the land was controlled by the principal of the company’s agent for the [LOC Karachaganak  ] project. -- 2000: A $9,000 payment was made to a company where a [MISC Kazakhstani  ] individual served as director , in exchange for his procuring import licenses . 
The individual may have been a government official. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Crain  ] and [PER Jones  ] stressed that the investigation to date has not shown that any of the money from the [LOC Karachaganak  ] incident went to [MISC Kazakhstani  ] government officials . 
The “money trail” ends with the agent hired in September 2000 , a [LOC UK  ] citizen who is the son of [PER Lord Kissin  ] . 
[MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Crain  ] expects the [LOC U.S.  ] court to issue a settlement agreement on the [ORG FCPA  ] case as early as next week . 
He expressed satisfaction with the agreement reached with the [ORG SEC  ] and [ORG DOJ  ] , which will require a [ORG Baker Hughes  ] subsidiary to enter into a plea agreement on bribery charges and pay a “substantial” fine . 
The parent company will agree to a two-year deferred prosecution agreement . 
[PER Crain  ] commented that this was more favorable than the standard three-year agreement offered by the [ORG SEC  ] , which he attributed to [ORG Baker Hughes’  ] cooperation with the [ORG SEC  ] , its thorough internal investigation , and its new , extremely strict compliance program. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Jones  ] and [PER Crain  ] said that their goal in briefing PM [PER Masimov  ] was to demonstrate the respect that [ORG Baker Hughes  ] as an investor has for [LOC Kazakhstan  ] and its laws , and thereby ensure that the firm will still be able to operate here and that its employees will not face harassment . 
They will also emphasize the fact that the investigation centered on commercial malfeasance and did not reveal the involvement of any high-ranking [MISC Kazakhstani  ] government officials . 
After the [PER Masimov  ] meeting took place , [PER Jones  ] contacted the Ambassador to relay Masimov’s request that the [MISC Embassy  ] convey the court decision as soon as it is released. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Request for guidance: Post requests Department’s authorization to confirm to the [MISC Kazakhstani  ] government that the [ORG SEC  ] and [ORG DOJ  ] authorized [ORG Baker Hughes  ] to share the details of the upcoming court decision . 
Post also seeks guidance on whether it would be appropriate for the [MISC Embassy  ] to convey the court decision to PM [PER Masimov  ] once it is made public .
