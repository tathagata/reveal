End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) IO DAS-Equivalent [PER Beatrice Le  ] Fraper du [PER Hellen  ] on April 7 regretted that the [ORG Human Rights Council  ] would be a less credible institution without [ORG USG  ] participation ( ref ) . 
She tempered her disappointment however with the observation that she had likewise argued -- but without success -- that [LOC France  ] not seek an [ORG HRC  ] seat in 2006 . 
From a tactical standpoint , it was smarter to hold off until 2007 in order to obtain a guaranteed a full 3-year term on the [ORG Council  ] . 
Candidates this year , she explained to [LOC Poloff  ] , were competing for 1-year , 2-year or 3-year terms on the newly launched [ORG HRC  ] ; in future , terms would run for three years . 
[ORG Le Fraper  ] bemoaned that [LOC France  ] now had to launch a worldwide diplomatic campaign for a seat without knowing in advance the length of the term it would be alloted on the [ORG Council  ] , which would be determined later by lottery . 
[ORG Le Fraper  ] asked for [ORG USG  ] support for the [MISC French  ] candidacy . 
[ORG Le Fraper  ] believed that the [ORG USG  ] would have at least as much influence as actual seated [ORG HRC  ] members on debates about establishing standard [ORG HRC  ] procedures during the inaugural year , because that policy would be articulated through regional groups. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) With the [LOC U.S.  ] absent from the [ORG HRC  ] , [ORG Le Fraper  ] urged regular [MISC French-U.S.  ] dialogue so that [ORG USG  ] equities could be taken into account . 
She noted the [MISC French  ] and [MISC American  ] [MISC Geneva-based  ] delegations enjoyed good relations . 
Regular consulatations were crucial , especially given the possibility that some [ORG EU  ] member would lobby to advance a resolution on Guantanamo detainees . 
However , [ORG Le Fraper  ] believed the fracas over renditions at the [ORG Council of Europe  ] had been salutary , if only for cautioning [ORG EU  ] members that they should tread lightly , since [MISC European  ] governments lacked full awareness of what transpired on their own territory , whether with or without direct government complicity. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG Le Fraper  ] lauded the [ORG USG  ] aim to actively encourage the [ORG HRC  ] to address serious cases of human rights abuse in countries such as [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] , [LOC Zimbabwe  ] , [LOC Burma  ] , [LOC Sudan  ] and [LOC South Korea  ] . 
FM [MISC Douste-Blazy  ] was now particularly exercised about [LOC Iran  ] , she said . 
Moreover , [LOC France  ] had lost patience with [LOC Zimbabwe  ] , [ORG Le Fraper  ] insisted , pointing to [MISC French  ] support for a human rights-related [ORG UNGA  ] resolution , a policy decision , she added , that had vexed the [MISC French  ] delegation in [LOC New York  ] , which had preferred not to roil the waters with the [ORG Africa Group.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG Le Fraper  ] forewarned that [LOC France  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] would be introducing a new draft legal convention about enforced disappearances at the [ORG HRC  ] . 
She regretted that the [ORG USG  ] would not be present at the [ORG Council  ] for discussions , but [LOC Argentina  ] in particular was keen on rolling out the draft this year , which marks the 30th anniversary of the launching of the so-called " [MISC Dirty War  ] . 
" The draft would also be presented at the General Assembly . 
[MISC French  ] involvement in the initiative dated to 1978 , after the disappearance of [MISC French  ] citizens in [LOC Argentina  ] . 
[ORG Le Fraper  ] commented she knew of [LOC U.S.  ] sensitivities about possible ramifications in the context of the detention of non-state actors . 
The Government of [LOC Colombia  ] , [PER Fraper  ] added , had also had expressed concerns , yet now appeared ready to support the draft . 
( [ORG Note: Human Rights PARIS  ] 00002358 002 OF 002 Desk Officer [PER Donatienne Hissard  ] clarified on April 10 that the [LOC U.S.  ] had joined consensus on negotiations of the convention while nonetheless expressing reserves about the " Right to Truth , " e.g. the rights of victims to information about the circumstances of their detention , as well as other rights for detainees . 
) Comment ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment and [ORG BioNote: Le  ] [PER Fraper  ] clearly sees the [ORG USG  ] as an indispensable player in the advocacy of human rights . 
While worrying the [ORG HRC  ] would lack weight without [ORG USG  ] membership , [ORG Le Fraper  ] otherwise discounted the impact of [ORG USG  ] non-participation , apart from advising there would be a need to consult closely in order to take [ORG USG  ] equities into account . 
[ORG Le Fraper  ] said the [ORG MFA  ] made an effort to avoid dramatization of the [LOC U.S.  ] decision in exchanges with the press and with [ORG NGOs  ] . 
[ORG Bionote: Le Fraper  ] mentioned that her sister , [PER Dorothe  ] [ORG Le Fraper  ] du [PER Hellen  ] , was also a dedicated human rights advocate , and a lawyer on the defense teams of both [PER Jose Bove  ] and [PER Zacarias Moussaoui  ] . 
[ORG Le Fraper  ] mentioned she had just accompanied her sister to the [LOC U.S.  ] consulate to apply for an expedited visa so that she could make an emergency trip to the trial . 
[ORG Le Fraper  ] mentioned that [ORG MFA  ] , especially [ORG MFA  ] spokesman [PER Mattei  ] , has been taking great pains to work hand in glove with the [ORG USG  ] with regard to the [PER Moussaoui  ] trial .
