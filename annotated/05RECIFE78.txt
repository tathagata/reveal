( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary . 
[PER John David Leonard  ] , an [MISC American  ] citizen missionary shot in [LOC Brazil  ] , has been medevaced back home to a hospital in [LOC Des Moines  ] , [LOC IA  ] , where he remains under medical care . 
Embassy LegAtt and [PER A/LegAtt  ] traveled to the area where Mr. [PER Leonard  ] was attacked , and report that investigation into the incident continues , although the assailants have not yet been identified . 
Contrary to some published speculation , there appears to be no political motive behind the attack , nor are there any connections to the recent murder of [MISC American  ] nun [PER Dorothy Stang  ] . 
Rather , the most likely motive appears to be either Mr. [PER Leonard  ] 's personal business practices as a landlord or his involvement in ministry in an area known for alcohol and drug abuse . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [MISC American  ] missionary [PER John David Leonard  ] returned to his home in [LOC Des Moines  ] , [LOC IA  ] via a privately arranged medevac . 
All aspects of the medevac were managed by the [MISC American  ] mission group supporting his work and its insurance carrier . 
Mr. [PER Leonard  ] arrived in the [LOC US  ] on Saturday , July 9 , and remains in [ORG Iowa Methodist Medical Center  ] . 
Neither Mr. [PER Leonard  ] 's family nor his missionary organization requested assistance from Consulate [LOC Recife  ] in arranging his medevac. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Embassy [PER LegAtt  ] and [PER A/LegAtt  ] visited [LOC Maceio  ] shortly after the shooting to express [ORG USG  ] interest in the case and determine the status of the [MISC Brazilian  ] investigation . 
Both reported that they had been given ample access to the principals and the freedom to interview relevant witnesses and other [MISC American  ] missionaries themselves . 
Based on their investigations , [PER LegAtt  ] 's impression is that this assassination attempt was not/not politically motivated against Mr. [PER Leonard  ] as an [MISC American  ] citizen , missionary or person involved in sensitive political or non-governmental organization ( NGO ) issues . 
Rather , [PER LegAtt  ] thinks that the murder attempt may well have links to Mr. [PER Leonard  ] 's unusual private business practices in [LOC Maceio  ] as a landlord renting homes to persons with very modest income or his vocal stance in anti-drug efforts . 
According to [PER LegAtt  ] , other [MISC American  ] missionaries described Mr. [PER Leonard  ] as charismatic and dynamic pastor , but weren't surprised by the assassination attempt. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) According to his family , Mr. [PER Leonard  ] had only recently returned to [LOC Brazil  ] from a professional sabbatical to care for a son recovering from an accident and receiving medical care in [LOC Maceio  ] . 
Mr. [PER Leonard  ] had been managing personal business affairs and arranging for his son 's return to the [LOC US  ] . 
[PER Beverly Leonard  ] , [PER John  ] 's wife , stated that they originally tried to have their son medevaced on the same flight as his father , but instead decided to have him return to [LOC Iowa  ] as originally scheduled in approximately two weeks .
