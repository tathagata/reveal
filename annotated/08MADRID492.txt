( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Repsol  ] and [ORG Shell  ] will sell their joint 50% stake in natural gas development in [LOC Iran  ] 's [LOC South Pars  ] block 14 , according to reports in the [MISC Spanish  ] business press . 
The two firms are reported to be negotiating an agreement with the [ORG GOI  ] in which they would give up their concession in exchange for an agreement that would allow them to obtain concessions on other blocks that they could develop once the political situation is more stable . 
One article said [ORG Repsol  ] and [ORG Shell  ] were seeking concessions for blocks 23 and 24 , which would be developed in the next decade . 
The firms also are reported to be working with the [ORG GOI  ] to seek a partner -- possibly [LOC Russia  ] 's [ORG Gazprom  ] , [LOC India  ] 's [ORG IOC  ] , or a [MISC Chinese  ] firm -- to take over the block 14 concession. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The press reports cited [ORG USG  ] pressure and also technical/economic factors as having contributed to the decision . 
The [ORG GOI  ] reportedly wants to develop block 14 as soon as possible , because it is near the border with [LOC Qatar  ] and the [ORG GOI  ] fears that the Qataris will extract most of the gas if [MISC Iranian  ] development is delayed . 
[ORG Repsol  ] and [ORG Shell  ] reportedly did not want to begin the project in June , because the increase in construction costs of gas liquefication ( [ORG LNG  ] ) plants would mean that they would want to renegotiate their existing contracts . 
One article said that the production from block 14 would now be used for the [MISC Iranian  ] domestic market or for export by pipeline , rather than [ORG LNG  ] export. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Comment: [ORG Repsol  ] CEO [PER Antonio Brufau  ] had told the Ambassador April 28 that [ORG Repsol  ] had decided to sell its concession options and that its board would vote that week to do so . 
Post has repeatedly emphasized to [ORG Repsol  ] and to the [ORG GOS  ] the [ORG USG  ] 's concerns about this project ( reftels ) , and the decision is a sign that the pressure has paid off . 
Nonetheless , with [ORG Repsol  ] reported not willing to completely cut ties to the [ORG GOI  ] , we do not expect that this decision , however welcome , will lead to a major change in [ORG GOS  ] views on hydrocarbons investment in [LOC Iran  ] .
