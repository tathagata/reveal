Crocker  ] , Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: In a January 27 meeting lasting more than an hour-and-a-half , Speaker of the [ORG House of Representatives  ] [PER Nancy Pelosi  ] and [ORG Committee/Sub-Committee Chairs  ] of the [ORG Armed Services  ] , Foreign Affairs , Intelligence and [ORG Appropriations Committees  ] called on [MISC Pakistani  ] President [PER Musharraf  ] . 
The Speaker noted that this was her first foreign travel in her new position , underscoring the importance the [ORG Congress  ] places on the [MISC U.S.-Pakistan  ] relationship . 
Acknowledging that this was an important visit , the President offered to describe [MISC Pakistan’s  ] strategies to defeat terrorism and extremism and to clarify [LOC U.S.  ] misperceptions about [MISC Pakistan’s  ] commitment. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) At the [MISC CODEL’s  ] request , the President reviewed his recent visit to [LOC Middle Eastern  ] capitals , where he promoted his vision of enlightened moderation for the [MISC Muslim  ] world ; he also counseled [MISC Syrian  ] President [PER Assad  ] to abandon his confrontational approach and reconcile with the international community . 
[PER Musharraf  ] offered a detailed analysis of the security situation along [MISC Pakistan’s  ] border with [LOC Afghanistan  ] and his strategy to win the support of local tribes through economic and social development , while eliminating al [ORG Qaeda  ] and [ORG Taliban  ] leadership cells through security operations . 
[PER Musharraf  ] told the [ORG CODEL  ] that critics who suggest that [MISC Pakistan’s  ] intelligence agencies are playing a double game in [LOC Afghanistan  ] are wrong , saying that such criticism only emboldens our common enemies . 
The President specifically requested Congressional support for [ORG Reconstruction Opportunity Zones  ] ( [ORG ROZs  ] ) and [LOC U.S.  ] support for his [ORG FATA  ] economic initiative of USD 150 million per year , noting [MISC Pakistan’s  ] own heavy commitment of national funds toward economic development in the border areas ; he also reviewed his government’s programs to increase spending on education and health care , as envisioned in the [MISC U.S.-Pakistan Shared  ] Objectives . 
[PER Musharraf  ] cast a hard gaze on narcotrafficking in the region , while highlighting [MISC Pakistan’s  ] anticipated achievement of “poppy free” status in 2007 . 
He was optimistic regarding the prospects for improved relations with [LOC India  ] . 
Finally , [PER Musharraf  ] told the Speaker that provisions of [ORG H.R.  ] 1 ( Implementing the 9/11 [MISC Commission Recommendations Act  ] of 2007 ) concerning [LOC Pakistan  ] weaken his position vis-a-vis extremists fighting for [MISC Muslim  ] hearts-and-minds in the long war on terror ; the Speaker was non-committal in response . 
End summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Meeting Participants: [LOC U.S.  ] ---- [ORG Rep.  ] [PER Nancy Pelosi  ] , Speaker of the [ORG House Rep.  ] [PER Ike Skelton  ] , Chair - [ORG House Armed Services Committee  ] Rep. [PER Tom Lantos  ] , Chair - [ORG House  ] Foreign Affairs Committee Rep. [PER Silvestre Reyes  ] , Chair - [ORG House Permanent Select Committee  ] on Intelligence Rep. [PER John Murtha  ] , Chair - [ORG Defense Appropriations Sub-Committee  ] Rep. [PER Nita Lowey  ] , Chair - State and Foreign Operations Sub-Committee Rep. [PER David Hobson  ] , [ORG Defense Appropriations Sub-Committee  ] Mr. [PER Michael Sheehy  ] , [ORG National Security Advisor  ] to Speaker [PER Pelosi  ] Ambassador [PER Ryan C. Crocker  ] Mr. [PER John Gastright  ] , Deputy Assistant Secretary of State [LOC Pakistan  ] -------- President [PER Pervez Musharraf  ] ISLAMABAD 00000528 002 OF 006 LTG [PER Hamid Javaid  ] , Chief of Staff [PER BG Shafqat Ahmad  ] , Military Secretary Outreach to [LOC Middle East:  ] Empower Moderates in [MISC Muslim World  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) When the Speaker asked about Musharraf’s January 20-25 visit to [LOC Middle Eastern  ] capitals ( [LOC Riyadh  ] , [LOC Cairo  ] , [LOC Amman  ] , [LOC Damascus  ] and [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] ) , [PER Musharraf  ] initiated a description of a [MISC Muslim World  ] beset by tension . 
An incipient [MISC Iraqi  ] civil war along sectarian lines , sectarian strife in [LOC Lebanon  ] , the [MISC Shi’a  ] dimension in the [MISC U.S.-Iran  ] conflict and , at the core , the unresolved [MISC Palestinian  ] question have led the President to believe the time is ripe for a new [MISC Muslim  ] voice of moderation . 
In his talks with his [MISC Arab  ] interlocutors , [PER Musharraf  ] laid out his goals: promoting sectarian harmony , organizing joint action against terrorist organizations and building partnerships with [LOC Europe  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] The next step is to engage the major non-Arab [MISC Muslim  ] states -- [LOC Indonesia  ] , [LOC Malaysia  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] . 
( Note: [PER Musharraf  ] is visiting [LOC Jakarta  ] and [LOC Kuala Lumpur  ] this week . 
End note . 
) He will then seek to develop a statement of common principals ; if this succeeds , [MISC Saudi  ] King [PER Abdullah  ] has pledged to host an event to launch the initiative. “I am trying to lead on this issue , ” [PER Musharraf  ] said , admitting that he cannot say whether his efforts will succeed. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) While in [LOC Damascus  ] , [PER Musharraf  ] said that he had a “frank exchange” with [MISC Syrian  ] President [PER Bashar Assad  ] , telling the [MISC Syrian  ] President that his policies are contributing to instability in [LOC Palestine  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] and [LOC Iraq.  ] “Are you for confrontation or not ? ” [PER Musharraf  ] demanded , noting that [LOC Syria  ] now has few friends left . 
[PER Bashar  ] responded by saying that he wants to reconcile with the international community and work to solve problems . 
[PER Musharraf  ] pointed to the need for peace between [ORG Hamas  ] and [LOC Israel  ] , obtaining [MISC Bashar’s  ] word that [LOC Syria  ] would not obstruct communications between the two . 
[PER Musharraf  ] offered to help [PER Bashar  ] regain standing in the international community , if [LOC Syria  ] is serious about a new direction . 
Representative [PER Hobson  ] asked whether the [LOC U.S.  ] should take a different approach with [PER Bashar  ] . 
[PER Musharraf  ] advised the [LOC U.S.  ] to engage [PER Bashar  ] ; he also believes that moderate [MISC Muslims  ] could influence the [MISC Syrian  ] . 
He observed that [PER Bashar  ] displayed a sense of being overlooked by the international community: for example , [PER Bashar  ] told [PER Musharraf  ] that the entire world supports the [MISC Palestinians  ] , but has forgotten the [MISC Israeli  ] occupation of the [LOC Golan Heights  ] . 
[PER Musharraf  ] wondered whether observers credit [PER Bashar  ] with wielding more power than he actually has , speculating that other forces may be at work . 
[PER Musharraf  ] perceived [PER Bashar  ] as facing problems similar to those along the [MISC PAK-AFG  ] border , quoting [PER Bashar  ] as saying that more than 1 million tribal refugees have flowed into [LOC Syria  ] from [LOC Iraq  ] . 
( Note: On hearing this , [PER Musharraf  ] offered [PER Bashar  ] some friendly advice: “Look into fencing.” End note . 
) [MISC Straight Talk  ] on [ORG Pak-Afghan Border Security  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Responding to Chairman Skelton’s desire to hear the President’s perspective on efforts to secure the [ORG Pak-Afghan  ] border , [PER Musharraf  ] decried the “tremendous misunderstandings and misperceptions” that have led [LOC U.S.  ] critics to accuse [MISC Pakistan’s  ] intelligence agencies of collusion with the [ORG Taliban  ] , al [ORG Qaeda  ] and other extremists . 
[PER Musharraf  ] frankly acknowledged that remnants of al [ORG Qaeda  ] remain hidden in the mountainous border region . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] is now also focused on the [MISC Pashtun  ] tribes who live on both sides of the [MISC PAK-AFG  ] border . 
Of the seven tribal agencies in [MISC Pakistan’s Federally Administered Tribal Areas  ] ( [ORG FATA  ] ) , populations in [LOC North  ] and [LOC South Waziristan  ] openly cooperate with [ORG Taliban  ] insurgents . 
[ORG Al Qaeda  ] elements are concentrated in [LOC Bajaur  ] . 
The other four agencies , [PER Musharraf  ] contended , are relatively peaceful , although the [ORG Taliban  ] has made an effort to infiltrate [LOC Kurram  ] , where it has encountered local resistance . 
In contrast , [PER Musharraf  ] continued , [MISC Pashtuns  ] residing in [LOC Balochistan  ] are generally peaceful ; the trouble ther are [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Taliban  ] commanders and foot soldiers who have found safe haven in lawless refugee camps , from which they can operate with impunity. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Speaker [PER Pelosi  ] asked the President whether he knew the whereabouts of [ORG Taliban  ] leader [PER Mullah Omar  ] . 
[PER Musharraf  ] replied that [PER Mullah Omar  ] and the [ORG Taliban  ] movement emerged from [LOC Kandahar  ] , where he presumably remains. “I do not believe [PER Omar  ] has ever been to [LOC Pakistan  ] , ” [PER Musharraf  ] said , contrasting this to al [ORG Qaeda  ] leaders [PER Osama bin Ladin  ] and Dr. [PER Ayman al-Zawahiri  ] , who may be ensconced in the mountains along the [ORG Frontier  ] . 
[PER Musharraf  ] proceeded to describe [MISC Pakistani  ] efforts to locate and apprehend other al [ORG Qaeda  ] leaders and [ORG Taliban  ] commanders , including [MISC Afghans  ] [PER Mullah Dadullah Lang  ] and [PER Jalaluddin Haqqani  ] and [MISC Pakistani  ] [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] ; these leaders , [PER Musharraf  ] said , come and go from [LOC Pakistan  ] , where they recruit and motivate militants. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) What is required to defeat the [ORG Taliban  ] ? 
[PER Musharraf  ] answered his own rhetorical question , saying that in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the [ORG Coalition must  ] deploy military and political resources , while [LOC Pakistan  ] controls movement across the [MISC PAK-AFG  ] border . 
The President painted a vivid picture of the on-the-ground challenges: there is no easy way to identify [ORG Taliban  ] fighters amongst the 30,000 people who cross the [LOC Chaman  ] border crossing in [LOC Balochistan  ] daily , only one of 23 crossing points along the province’s 2300 km border with [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Even with 954 border posts , the government has not been able to control dozens of informal crossing points in [LOC Balochistan  ] and the [ORG FATA  ] . 
The strategy must therefore penetrate deeply into the border regions , focusing on ( a ) eliminating safe havens , including refugee camps ; ( b ) launching military action against the militants’ command-and-control targets , and ( c ) winning the loyalty of local tribes through economic growth , social development and political reform. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Arguing that military operations alone will alienate the tribes , [PER Musharraf  ] segued into an overview of the [ORG FATA Sustainable Development Plan  ] and a description of the traditional leadership roles of maliks ( who represent tribal authority ) and political agents ( who represent federal and provincial authorities ) . 
To ensure that political agents and maliks have the necessary muscle to reinforce their authority to impose law and order , the government is bolstering the numbers and capacity of tribal levies , the [ORG Frontier Constabulary  ] and the [ORG Frontier Corps  ] . 
As the Speaker described Chairwoman [MISC Lowey’s  ] leadership of the [ORG Foreign Operations Appropriations Sub-Committee  ] , the President expressed appreciation for her support for [ORG Reconstruction Opportunity Zones  ] ( ROZs ) , and appealed for USD 150 million/year for five years for [ORG FATA  ] development to supplement the national funds already budgeted. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Political engagement is crucial , [PER Musharraf  ] said , shifting to a discussion of the September 2006 jirga accord in [LOC North Waziristan.  ] “This agreement is much maligned , ” [PER Musharraf  ] admitted , but it was critical for the government to reach out to local tribal and religious leaders . 
Re-establishing the writ of the government is imperative , but the authorities must work with the local tribes to make this a reality . 
The greatest failure , [PER Musharraf  ] continued , has been controlling cross-border movement and expelling foreign fighters from the agency ; the government is now pushing the tribes hard to live up to their side of the bargain . 
If they do not , the President said , we will take military action. “When we locate a target , we will hit it , ” Musahrraf promised , noting that [MISC Pakistani  ] forces had done just that ten days earlier . 
Candidly assessing the agreement as only 25 percent successful so far , [PER Musharraf  ] was adamant that the jirga agreement is/is the only way forward . 
He said he believes that the [LOC North West Frontier Province  ] ( [ORG NWFP  ] ) Governor should pursue a similar accord with tribes in [LOC South Waziristan.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Shifting back to preventing unlawful border crossings , [PER Musharraf  ] addressed the possibility of selective deployment of fences and/or land mines along the border. “Mining has problems , ” [PER Musharraf  ] acknowledged , but said he wants to proceed with fencing . 
Military experts have estimated that some 32 km in [ORG FATA  ] and 295 km in [LOC Balochistan  ] would be appropriate for fences . 
When Chairman [PER Reyes  ] noted the controversy generated by proposals to fence the [MISC U.S.-Mexican  ] border , [PER Musharraf  ] nodded in agreement , then cited [MISC Pakistan’s  ] long experience with fences and mines along its eastern border with [LOC India.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Expanding his comments to include [MISC Pakistani  ] plans to close lawless [MISC Afghan  ] refugee camps , [PER Musharraf  ] asserted that “nobody wants to assist us in this task.” Frustrated that “all the ideas I put forward for controlling the border” are opposed by both the international community and the government in [LOC Kabul  ] , [PER Musharraf  ] said that he welcomes other ideas. “Either help me control the border or help me move the refugees out , ” he said . 
Defending [ORG Pakistan’s Commitment  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Musharraf  ] told the [ORG CODEL  ] that the government is committed to fighting terrorism , as Pakistanis do not want to see their country succumb to creeping Talibanization . 
[PER Musharraf  ] detailed the heavy losses sustained by [MISC Pakistan’s  ] security forces , as well as the multiple assassination attempts against the country’s political leadership , “We are not a banana republic and the ISI is not a rogue agency , ” [PER Musharraf  ] said , explaining that he could retire any active-duty general officer with a swipe of his pen: “ISI is a disciplined service staffed by seasoned military officers who follow my orders.” <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Later in the conversation , the President expressed concern about [ORG H.R.  ] 1 ( Implementing the 9/11 [MISC Commission Recommendations Act  ] ) . 
[PER Musharraf  ] said that language in the bill questioning [MISC Pakistan’s  ] reliability as an ally of the [LOC U.S.  ] directly damages his ability to wage war on our common enemies ( “This weakens me ! ” ) and to inoculate his country against the infection of [MISC Islamic  ] extremism . 
Shared Objectives and Enlightened Moderation -------------------------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Chairwoman [PER Lowey  ] asked the President to explain why [LOC Pakistan  ] has not met mutually-agreed targets for budgetary support for education set forth in the bilateral Shared Objectives . 
[PER Musharraf  ] defended his record , saying that since he assumed power , he has embraced human resource development as essential for sustained growth . 
He opted for an inital focus on economic development to generate revenue for health and education , and this is happening . 
Education spending is increasing from 2.6 to 4 percent of GDP under his leadership . 
Chairman [PER Murtha  ] raised the subject of madrassas , to which the President responded that the appeal of a madrassa education will decline as the public education system improves . 
[PER Musharraf  ] also highlighted the government’s record in improving health care delivery , particularly maternal-pediatric services. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Speaker [PER Pelosi  ] raised the specter of suicide bombings , seeking the President’s advice on persuading all societies that such attacks are unacceptable . 
[PER Musharraf  ] agreed , terming suicide attacks as un-Islamic . 
All countries must find a way to deal with extremism , ” the President said , “but such terrorism must be addressed by force.” He then outlined his multi-point strategy for combating extremism and promoting “enlightened moderation”: -- Prevent the misuse of mosques -- Prohibit speech that incites the public to violence -- Ban extremist organizations and their leadership ( a delicate business , the President admitted , as the government must not/not be seen as anti-religion ) -- Revise the national curriculum -- Reform madrassa education , introducing a standard curriculum that includes secular subjects ( math , language , science , etc . 
) A Poppy-Free [LOC Pakistan  ] --------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Chairman [PER Murtha  ] also complimented [MISC Pakistan’s  ] achievements in fighting the drug trade , asking the President to explain [MISC Pakistan’s  ] success in contrast with the record poppy harvest in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Musharraf  ] responded: “There is no effective government control in [LOC Afghanistan.” Pakistan  ] was able to implement a coordinated strategy of eradication and destruction , complemented by programs to offer alternative livelihoods . 
The poppy leads only to narco-fueled financial flows supporting the insurgency . 
[PER Musharraf  ] suggested that the international community provide funds to buy the [MISC Afghan  ] poppy crop directly from the farmers . 
Earthquake Relief ----------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) Chairman [PER Lantos  ] asked the President whether [LOC Pakistan  ] needs the [LOC U.S.  ] to do more to support relief/reconstruction efforts in the areas devastated by the October 2005 earthquake . 
[PER Musharraf  ] assured the Chairman that [LOC Pakistan  ] is managing the reconstruction process well , noting that prompt intervention had prevented the predicted post- disaster plagues of epidemics , famine and exposure . 
Now well into the reconstruction phase , the government has allocated USD 3000 to 500,000 families , whose use of the funds to rebuild their homes also injects capital to the recovering local economy . 
The government has built many temporary schools and university buildings , many of which are better facilities than those which were destroyed . 
[ORG Indo-Pak Relations  ] ------------------ <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) Chairman [PER Lantos  ] asked about the state of [MISC Pakistan’s  ] relations with [LOC India  ] . 
[PER Musharraf  ] was upbeat in his response , saying that he has his fingers crossed . 
The two countries have made progress with confidence-building measures and have successfully maintained a cease-fire along the [LOC Line-of-Control  ] in [LOC Kashmir  ] , but the process had stalled on conflict resolution . 
Now , [PER Musharraf  ] indicated , he and Prime Minister [PER Manmohan Singh  ] are on the verge of an agreement...”Soon -- sooner than anyone might think.” [PER Musharraf  ] appreciated [MISC Singh’s  ] flexibility , relating [MISC Singh’s  ] personal invitation for the President to attend the [ORG SAARC Ministerial  ] in [LOC New Delhi  ] in April . 
[PER Musharraf  ] explained his decision to decline the invitation , saying that there is too much euphoria and expectation at present. “If I went to [LOC Delhi  ] , but we didn’t sign an agreement , the people would think we had failed , ” he said . 
[PER Musharraf  ] said that he has conveyed two options to [LOC New Delhi:  ] either PM [PER Singh  ] comes to [LOC Pakistan  ] before April to sign an agreement or the two hold a signing ceremony at the [ORG SAARC Ministerial  ] . 
[PER Musharraf  ] shared his enthusiasm for the just-concluded visit to [LOC Pakistan  ] by three [MISC Jammmu  ] and [LOC Kashmir  ] leaders of the All [MISC Parties Hurriyat Conference  ] , noting that he had advised them to egage and bring on board other Kashmiris. “An agreement should not land like a bombshell , ” said [PER Musharraf  ] . 
Leaders must prepare their publics , as he is doing in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[ORG Iraq’s Shadow  ] over the [LOC Region  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) Speaker [PER Pelosi  ] described the current situation in [LOC Iraq  ] as the most important foreign policy issue confronting the [LOC U.S.  ] , citing the terrible loss of life and the consequences for [MISC America’s  ] global reputation . 
President [PER Musharraf  ] opined that dividing [LOC Iraq  ] would be disastrous , citing [MISC Turkish  ] opposition to an independent [LOC Kurdistan  ] . 
He believes that [LOC Iran  ] is abetting the growing [MISC Sunni-Shi’a  ] schism . 
Referring back to his initiative to build a movement of moderate [MISC Muslim  ] voices , [PER Musharraf  ] said this must be done by partners who have credibility in the region , something that the [LOC U.S.  ] does not currently enjoy . 
If a consensus could be endorsed by [MISC Sunnis  ] , [MISC Shi’as  ] and [MISC Kurds  ] , [PER Musharraf  ] mused , perhaps an all-Muslim security force could backfill following the withdrawal of [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC British  ] forces. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( U ) The [ORG CODEL  ] did not have an opportunity to clear this cable .
