( S ) Key Points: -- New [ORG North Sinai  ] Governor [PER Mowafi  ] told poloff his top priority was to increase economic opportunities . 
He plans to increase the size of the [LOC El Arish  ] port to facilitate an export economy , expand agricultural production in the coastal areas , and build heavy industries in central [ORG Sinai  ] and the industrial zone in [LOC El Arish  ] to keep a higher percentage of the value chain in [ORG Sinai  ] . 
-- [PER Sinai MPs  ] told us that comprehensive economic development is the solution to resolving [ORG Sinai  ] 's problems including providing security , eliminating smuggling and controlling terrorism . 
They stressed that the provision of water was needed to facilitate development . 
-- Local [ORG Sinai  ] leaders questioned the Government of [LOC Egypt  ] 's ( [ORG GoE  ] ) commitment to [ORG Sinai  ] 's economic development because [LOC Cairo  ] 's approach is oriented toward military control not attracting investment . 
They said [LOC Cairo  ] 's policies discourage local and foreign involvement in favor of " [LOC Nile Valley  ] " investors . 
-- [MISC Egyptian  ] and [MISC Bedouin  ] leaders agreed that problems in [ORG Sinai  ] are closely linked to problems in [LOC Gaza  ] and [LOC Israel  ] . 
The Governor and [PER MPs  ] said that [LOC Egypt  ] is unlikely to exercise control over the smuggling problem until it has a " partner " on the other side of the border . 
-- [MISC Islamic  ] [ORG NGOs  ] responded quickly to provide assistance to those whose homes and property were damaged by recent heavy rains . 
The [ORG GoE  ] has promised compensation , but government assistance was " taking time . 
" -- [PER MPs  ] and local leaders expressed frustration [ORG USAID  ] 's [LOC Life Sinai  ] project had been ineffective . 
Some leaders believe that the delay is damaging the reputation of the [ORG USG  ] in [LOC Sinai.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: [PER Mowafi  ] was cerebral about [ORG Sinai  ] 's problems and appears willing to listen to and engage with [MISC Bedouin  ] leaders . 
He is focused on creating sustainable economic opportunities for the people in [LOC North Sinai  ] . 
However , mutual distrust between [ORG Sinai  ] [MISC Bedouin  ] and [ORG GoE  ] officials will make cooperation difficult and [PER Mowafi  ] will have to deal with various [ORG GoE  ] agencies and historical cooperation and commercial problems . 
The [ORG GoE  ] remains anxious about our [ORG Sinai  ] contacts ; we learned halfway through our meeting with local council members that the discussion was being recorded by [MISC Egyptian  ] State Security ( [ORG SSIS  ] ) . 
Our contacts from central [ORG Sinai  ] were met by [ORG SSIS  ] prior to our meeting . 
However , unlike past meetings , [ORG SSIS  ] gave them permission to meet with us , but they were instructed " not talk about any of their problems . 
" During our February 9-11 trip [LOC El Arish  ] residents were excited that President [PER Mubarak  ] would visit the city for the first time in his 28-year presidency during the week of February 13 . 
However , [PER Mubarak  ] did not make the visit and we have heard of no plans to reschedule . 
New Governor Respected , [PER Represents Hope  ] for Change <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) New [ORG North Sinai  ] Governor [PER Mourad Mohamed Ahmed Mowafi  ] told poloff during a recent three-day trip to northern [ORG Sinai  ] that his top priority for [LOC North Sinai  ] is to increase economic opportunities . 
He plans to increase the size of the [LOC El Arish  ] port to facilitate an export economy , expand agricultural production in the coastal areas , build heavy ( sand glass , marble and limestone ) industries in central [ORG Sinai  ] and the industrial zone in [LOC El Arish  ] to process the raw materials and keep a higher percentage of the value chain in [LOC CAIRO  ] 00000249 002 OF 005 [ORG Sinai  ] . 
[LOC El Arish  ] MP [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( protect ) and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( protect ) , of the [ORG Bedouin Desert Association  ] , said Governor [PER Mowafi  ] is educated on the [ORG Sinai  ] [MISC Bedouin  ] and wants to engage with them unlike the previous Governor , whom they described as fixated on military control . 
Local Leaders Question [LOC Cairo  ] 's Commitment <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) MP [ORG El Kassas  ] and Dr. [PER Reda Abu Hatab  ] , sociological advisor to the past six [ORG North Sinai Governors  ] , told us [LOC Cairo  ] is " ignorant of [MISC Bedouin  ] culture " and its use of the [MISC Egyptian  ] police and military to " control the population " rather than engaging in dialogue with the [MISC Bedouin  ] sheikhs is counterproductive . 
MP [PER Abu Harb  ] said the extreme security measures used to control [ORG Sinai  ] makes people feel like they are " under siege . 
" He said the people in [ORG Sinai  ] want security , but the tactics of [MISC Egyptian  ] security only make them angry and dissatisfied . 
[ORG Economic Development  ] to [ORG Resolve Sinai 's Problems  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [MISC Bedouin MPs  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( protect ) , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( protect ) and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( protect ) told us that comprehensive economic development is the solution to resolving [ORG Sinai  ] 's problems including providing security , eliminating smuggling and controlling terrorism . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the inability to attract capital to the [MISC Sinai/Gaza/Israel  ] border area limits growth in Sheikh [PER Zoweid  ] and [LOC Rafah  ] . 
( Note: Sheikh [PER Zoweid  ] and [LOC Rafah  ] have predominately [MISC Bedouin  ] and [MISC Palestinian  ] populations and are the location for many of the tunnels that supply [LOC Gaza  ] . 
End Note ) . 
MP [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [LOC El Arish  ] local councilman [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( protect ) said economic development efforts should target the youth because they are the most affected by unemployment and the most prone to anger and violence . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believes " economic investment will bring security . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us the northern coastal areas of [ORG Bir El Abd  ] , [LOC El Arish  ] , [PER Shaykh Zoweid  ] and [LOC Rafah  ] produce olives , tomatoes and fruits , but need processing plants to convert these products into higher end oils , sauces and juices for export . 
[PER Abdallah Qandil  ] , a local councilman from [ORG Bir Hasana  ] in central [ORG Sinai  ] supports the idea of an industrial zone and expanded seaport because central [ORG Sinai  ] 's mineral resources are currently either sent to [LOC Cairo  ] for processing or exported as raw materials so much of their potential value to [PER Sinai  ] is lost . 
Water Needed to [ORG Sustain Agriculture Development  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) MP [PER Al Roqei  ] told us that that sustainable development should focus on a " community and family approach " to agriculture and animal husbandry since most [MISC Sinai Bedouin  ] are either farmers or herders . 
He said water is needed for both industries to succeed . 
[PER Al Roqei  ] also encouraged the development of the handicraft industry as a way for [MISC Sinai Bedouin  ] women to contribute to the family income . 
[PER Hamid  ] and [PER Hassan Al Qardouh  ] , a local councilman from [LOC Nekhl  ] in central [ORG Sinai  ] said projects in animal husbandry such as raising rabbits to sell in [MISC Egyptian  ] markets could create livelihoods for central [MISC Sinai Bedouin  ] women and youth. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [LOC Rafah  ] local councilman [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( protect ) said the youth in [LOC Rafah  ] know how to farm , and we confirmed that he presented a plan to [ORG USAID  ] 's [LOC Life Sinai  ] program for the digging and pumping of wells to create livelihoods . 
( Note: Life [PER Sinai  ] is a [MISC USD  ] 9 million project to help develop [LOC Central Sinai  ] . 
[ORG El Alayan  ] 's proposed wells are in the northern coastal area and are of medium depth ( between 60-90 meters ) unlike wells in central [ORG Sinai  ] , which are around 1,000 meters deep . 
End Note ) . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] suggested the creation of a " youth villages " where 1,000 young , poor families would be given a [LOC CAIRO  ] 00000249 003 OF 005 house and 6 feddans to farm . 
The three [MISC Bedouin MPs  ] also support the extension of the [LOC Salam  ] canal from [ORG Bir El Abd  ] because it could provide 300,000 more feddans for farming , but [PER Wael Salim  ] , a local councilman for [LOC El Arish  ] said [LOC Egypt  ] and its development partners should consider the desalination of [LOC Mediterranean Sea  ] water coupled with drip irrigation as an alternative to extending the [LOC Salam Canal  ] . 
( Note: [ORG USAID  ] believes that extending the canal would actually cost a multiple of [MISC USD  ] 50 million and yield questionable economic value . 
End Note ) . 
[ORG Unfavorable Investment Climate  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG El Kassas  ] told us that three local [MISC Bedouin  ] investors , some of whom are [MISC MPs  ] , recently had their proposal to construct a cement factory denied by [LOC Cairo  ] because " there was no supporting infrastructure for the plant . 
" However , according to [ORG El Kassas  ] , the two existing cement plants , owned by [LOC Nile Valley  ] businessman [PER Hasan Rateb  ] , are allowed to bring in 2000 cubic meters of water a day from a desalination facility in [LOC Rafah  ] to aid in operations , and the [MISC Egyptian  ] military was granted permission to build a similar cement factory . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( protect ) , a local councilman from [LOC El Arish  ] told us he believed that the [MISC Bedouin  ] cement factory proposal was rejected after pressure from [PER Rateb  ] who is a friend of President [PER Mubarak  ] . 
He said this decision had a " discouraging effect " on the local population because even MPs are not allowed to " participate " in economic growth areas . 
MP Kharafeen added that [LOC Cairo  ] always has good words on economic development , but there are never any commensurate actions . 
As an example , MP [ORG El Kassas  ] told us that the [ORG Ministry of Tourism  ] has a long-standing plan to establish tourist resorts along the 200 kilometers of shoreline in [LOC North Sinai  ] , but has yet to open an official tourism promotion office in the [LOC Governorate.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [ORG El Kassas  ] and [PER Atta  ] said [MISC Egyptian  ] laws prohibiting foreign ownership of land and requiring foreigners to have an [MISC Egyptian  ] partner are a deterrent to investors . 
[PER Atta  ] stated that the inability to own land is a significant factor dissuading foreign investment because investors fear the land can be expropriated at any time as a result of the [ORG GoE  ] 's imminent domain . 
( Note: Foreign ownership of agricultural land is prohibited , but [MISC Egyptian  ] law does allow 100 percent ownership of investment projects , with limited exceptions . 
Given [PER Sinai  ] 's status as a military zone , the the foreign ownership law may not apply . 
End Note ) . <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) MP [ORG El Kassas  ] stated that investors are afraid to put money into [LOC North Sinai  ] because of its close proximity to [LOC Gaza  ] . 
He stated that internal [MISC Palestinian  ] issues need to be solved before [LOC North Sinai  ] can " begin to grow its economy and provide real security for the people . 
" [ORG El Kassas  ] believes that if there were a solution to [LOC Gaza  ] and borders were opened for trade that the area would experience an " economic renaissance . 
" [LOC Gaza  ] Solution Vital to [LOC North Sinai  ] 's [ORG Security and Development  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) [PER Atta  ] and [ORG El Kassas  ] were happy about [LOC Egypt  ] 's construction of the underground steel barrier along the border because it is needed to " protect the [MISC Egyptian  ] homeland . 
" Despite [PER Atta  ] 's support , he told us that the [LOC North Sinai  ] local council believes it will increase tensions on both sides of the border and could lead to violence in [LOC North Sinai  ] as displaced smugglers look for other ways to make money . 
He said the international community needs to consider opening the borders to allow for the legal supply of food and medicine into [LOC Gaza  ] and help with security in [LOC North Sinai.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Governor [PER Mowafi  ] said smuggling in [PER Sinai  ] is a " national security issue " because weapons from [LOC Israel  ] are making their way into [LOC North Sinai  ] . 
He stated that smuggling will not stop until [LOC Egypt  ] " has a partner on the other side of the border in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
" [PER Mowafi  ] said [ORG HAMAS  ] has " an anti-Egypt agenda " , which has put regional and local pressure on the [ORG GoE  ] and exacerbated problems [LOC CAIRO  ] 00000249 004 OF 005 with the [LOC North Sinai  ] population and the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] . 
He believes that [LOC Israel  ] should either support the reconciliation of [ORG HAMAS  ] and the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] , or return to the [LOC Philadelphi  ] corridor to help control smuggling . 
He noted that [PER Sinai  ] tribes such as the [LOC Suwarka  ] , [LOC Tayaha  ] and [LOC Tarabeen  ] have members living in [LOC Gaza  ] and [LOC Israel  ] and this renders [LOC Egypt  ] 's unilateral attempts to control illegal activities nearly impossible. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) MPs [PER Al Roqei  ] and [ORG El Kassas  ] agree that the smugglers are filling a void created by [LOC Israel  ] 's policy of denying basic shipments to [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[PER Al Roqei  ] said [MISC Bedouin  ] do not think in terms of nationalist identity , but are only focused on making money . 
[ORG El Kassas  ] stated that [LOC Israel  ] should act responsibly and allow food and medical supplies in to [LOC Gaza  ] , which would greatly reduce the demand for smuggling , but noted that [MISC Egyptian  ] soldiers aid smugglers in exchange for cash payments . 
Additionally , [MISC Egyptian  ] subsidies make smuggling of oil products profitable . 
[ORG El Kassas  ] told us that low octane fuels and diesel can be purchased in [LOC Egypt  ] for around 2 New [MISC Israeli  ] Shekels ( [ORG NIS  ] ) /liter ( USD 0.53 ) and sold in [LOC Gaza  ] for 7.5 NIS/liter ( USD 2 ) . 
Rains [PER Flood El Arish  ] ; Benefit Central [PER Sinai  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Mowafi  ] told us that [LOC North Sinai  ] received four times its average rainfall during January and the first half of February . 
This water coupled with run off from [LOC Israel  ] created havoc in [LOC El Arish  ] 's wadi ( riverbed ) and surrounding neighborhoods ( reftel ) . 
He said " construction violations " in the wadi were all destroyed by January floods as were the roads linking [LOC West  ] and [LOC East El Arish  ] . 
( Note: The [ORG North Sinai Governorate  ] allowed people to build houses in the wadi , facilitated the construction of a bus terminal and the open market in the area , and the [MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG Ministry of Youth  ] built its [LOC Olympic Village  ] there . 
All were destroyed during the floods . 
End Note ) . 
However , [PER Mowafi  ] and central [PER Sinai Bedouin  ] leaders said the rains had benefitted central [PER Sinai  ] by increasing the groundwater and creating agricultural opportunities . 
However , [PER Hamid  ] said the lack of tractors will mean that 60 percent of the land will still go uncultivated . 
( Note: [ORG USAID  ] 's [LOC Life Sinai  ] project is to provide five tractors for central [PER Sinai  ] agricultural sector development , but they will not be delivered until sometime between April-June 2010 . 
End Note ) . 
[ORG Islamic Organizations Provide Assistance  ] , [ORG GoE  ] Slow to Respond <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Atta  ] told us that local [ORG NGOs  ] played the biggest role in helping people in [LOC El Arish  ] that were affected by the floods . 
He said the [PER Shabbat Muslimat  ] ( [ORG Young Muslim Women 's Association  ] ) was the most organized [ORG NGO  ] and the first to respond to flood victims by providing emergency assistance . 
[PER Atta  ] told us that the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] also provided immediate medical care for those injured in the floods . 
[PER Soheir Gelbana  ] , President of [PER Shabbat Muslimat  ] , told us the organization organized [ORG NGO  ] volunteer efforts to assist those displaced by the flood . 
Local volunteers packaged and delivered emergency kits that included blankets and clothing for men , women and children as well as basic food kits with oil , sugar , rice , beans and lentils. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Dr. [PER Abu Hatab  ] praised the efforts of the local [ORG NGOs  ] and [ORG Sinai University  ] for providing cash , emergency aid and medical services for those who were injured or lost their homes in the floods . 
He said the [ORG GoE  ] promised restitution for lost homes , but this was " taking time . 
" ( Note: President [PER Mubarak  ] promised [ORG LE  ] 50,000 ( USD 9,090 ) for families that lost homes during the flood . 
End Note ) . 
[PER Abu Rateb  ] stated that the [MISC GoE-NGO  ] cooperation was needed , but was not taking place due to government mistrust of the [ORG NGOs  ] . 
Growing Frustration with [ORG U.S. Assistance CAIRO  ] 00000249 005 OF 005 <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) All the MPs and local councilmen praised [ORG USAID  ] 's past efforts in working with the [LOC North Sinai  ] Businessmen 's [ORG Association (  ] [ORG NSBA  ] ) to build a microcredit industry , but they expressed frustration [ORG USAID  ] 's current [LOC Life Sinai  ] project had " not implemented any projects in two years . 
" ( Note: [ORG USAID  ] and its contractor lack unfettered access to many of the project sites in central [ORG Sinai  ] . 
End Note ) . 
The MPs and central [ORG Sinai  ] councilmen asked why buses purchased to take [ORG Sinai  ] children to school have sat in the [ORG Governorate  ] parking lot since September . 
MP [ORG El Kassas  ] said the locals were keenly aware that the [MISC USAID-purchased  ] buses were used during the recent visits of PM Nazif and [ORG First Lady  ] [PER Suzanne Mubarak  ] , but were not being used to take children to school as intended . 
[ORG NSBA  ] Chairman [PER Mahmoud Al Refai  ] acknowledged his organization had great success in working with [ORG USAID  ] on the microcredit project , but said the decision to turn [LOC Life Sinai  ] 's implementation over to " an [MISC Egyptian  ] liaison " was damaging the reputation of the [ORG USG  ] in [ORG Sinai  ] . 
( Note: [ORG NSBA  ] was involved the [LOC Life Sinai  ] bus transportation project for which it spent 35,000 [MISC Egyptian  ] pounds ( USD 6,400 ) . 
However , a dispute between [ORG NSBA  ] , the [ORG North Sinai Governorate  ] and [ORG USAID  ] 's contractor over financing has left the buses sitting in the [ORG Governorate  ] 's parking lot for the past 5 months . 
End Note ) . 
( Comment: [ORG USAID  ] is working with the [ORG North Sinai Governorate  ] to resolve project implementation and access problems . 
End Comment ) .
