( U ) More than 100 people overflowed a conference room for a symposium on human trafficking sponsored by the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] and the [ORG Ministry of Justice and Human Rights  ] on October 30 . 
Foreign Minister [PER Ossur Skarphedinsson  ] opened the symposium by declaring the [ORG GOI  ] 's unwavering support for the fight against human trafficking . 
He stressed that TIP was a top priority for the government . 
Noting that the [ORG GOI  ] has already drafted and issued a national anti-TIP action plan , the Minister said ratifying the [MISC Palermo Protocol  ] during the current parliamentary season was imperative. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Another speaker , the Deputy Special Representative of the [ORG OSCE  ] for Combating Trafficking in [MISC Human Beings  ] [PER Ruth Pojman  ] , complimented [MISC Icelandic  ] authorities on drafting the national anti-TIP action plan and stressed the importance of implementing it . 
Representatives from the police department that handles [ORG Keflavik Airport  ] , the Prime Minister 's Office , the [ORG Ministry of Justice and Human Rights  ] , and a legal counsel from the [ORG NGO Intercultural Center  ] also spoke at the symposium . 
Most of the speakers referred to the recent apprehension of a number of alleged traffickers as an example of how [LOC Iceland  ] was stepping up its efforts in this area. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [PER Ms. Pojman  ] came from [LOC Vienna  ] for this event and a full day of meetings with key players in TIP in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
She substituted at the last minute for her boss , [PER Eva Biaudet  ] , who was ill . 
After the symposium , [PER Ms. Pojman  ] told [ORG CDA  ] that she was encouraged by the turnout and the conference and credited , at least in part , the [LOC U.S.  ] TIP report with providing the impetus to move things forward in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
She said she was too fully booked to meet with the Embassy during her stay , which would include a visit to a shelter as well as meetings with the range of stakeholders . 
The following day , [LOC Iceland  ] 's two major newspapers reported on the symposium with a full page spread. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) The audience included former Foreign Minister [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] , and a number of officials from various ministries ( including the top legal advisor at the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] ) , representatives from [ORG NGOs  ] and law enforcement . 
( [PER Note: Gisladottir  ] is a candidate for the position of [ORG OSCE  ] Special Representative for Combating TIP . 
) In addition , the Ambassadors from [LOC Finland  ] , [LOC Sweden  ] and [LOC Norway  ] as well as Charge also attended the entire discussion. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: As the first [MISC TIP-related  ] event of such magnitude ever held in [LOC Iceland  ] , this symposium demonstrates the [ORG GOI  ] 's intention to step up the fight against [ORG TIP  ] and make it a priority . 
The fight against [ORG TIP  ] was on the backburner of [MISC Icelandic  ] politics until this year when the first national anti-TIP action plan was drafted last March . 
The symposium coincided with two important [MISC TIP-related  ] events , namely the court proceedings in the first ever TIP case in [LOC Iceland  ] , and second , the recent revelation of a case involving the possible trafficking of a 19-year-old [MISC Lithuanian  ] girl into prostitution in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
The symposium is yet another development this year that will put the fight against [ORG TIP  ] more firmly on the political radar in [LOC Iceland  ] .
