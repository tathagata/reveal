<code><pre>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 03 ISLAMABAD 001118 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 05/23/2019 TAGS PGOV , PREF , EAID , MOPS , PHUM , MARR , PREL , PK , [PER TU SUBJECT:  ] [MISC TURKISH  ] AMBASSADOR: THEIR TRILATERALS , FRIENDS , [ORG NATO  ] , IDP AID , AND [ORG NAWAZ Classified  ] By: [PER Anne W. Patterson  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: The Ambassador , accompanied by EmbOffs , met May 20 with [MISC Turkish  ] Ambassador [PER Soysal  ] and other [MISC Turkish  ] counterparts . 
The [MISC Turkish  ] Embassy , which has taken on a coordinating role for [ORG NATO  ] in [LOC Pakistan  ] , advocated greater cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] vis-a-vis [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[PER Soysal  ] described Turkey’s own trilateral meetings with [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
He thought the [MISC Af-Pak  ] relationship had improved since the February 2008 elections and credited Foreign Minister [PER Shah Mehmood Qureshi  ] in particular for this “geographic sensitivity.” While [LOC Turkey  ] hoped their trilaterals would result in cooperative programs , the real objective was increased trust and transparency between the two neighbors . 
The trilaterals had matured past joint statements ; decisions on specific projects needed to be implemented for the meetings to be worthwhile , [PER Soysal  ] said . 
Encouragingly , the three countries had already conducted a number of joint training on a range of subjects . 
[PER Soysal  ] agreed that the “Friends of [MISC Democratic  ] Pakistan” initiative should not morph into a donors forum , despite the [MISC GOP  ] predilection . 
He believed a strong secretariat , along the lines of a task force model , was needed to ensure the initiative’s policy success . 
[ORG NATO  ] could also contribute to [MISC Pakistan’s  ] development , sponsoring education initiatives and professional exchanges. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Summary continued: [MISC Turkish  ] President [PER Gul  ] would call President [PER Zardari  ] May 22 to offer an aid package for internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) . 
[PER Soysal  ] focused on the July/August timeframe , which this year includes [MISC Ramadan  ] , suggesting [MISC Turkish  ] aid may be more post-emergency . 
So far , [LOC Turkey  ] was the only [MISC Muslim  ] country to contribute to this humanitarian crisis , though [PER Soysal  ] hoped next week’s [ORG Organization of Islamic Conference  ] ( [ORG OIC  ] ) would take action . 
He was frustrated the [MISC GOP  ] had no timeline for the offensive in [LOC Swat  ] and thought the [ORG Army  ] was moving too slowly to initiate operations in the [LOC Waziristans  ] before next year . 
He was not certain [MISC Pakistani  ] politics would be so patient and encouraged international missions to push for a non-partisan climate for as long as possible . 
Most of the responsibility for this , however , rested with [PER Zardari  ] , who needed to employ confidence building measures within his own party and with other parties , especially leading opposition [LOC Pakistan  ] [MISC Muslim  ] [ORG League-Nawaz  ] ( [ORG PML-N  ] ) . 
End summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [MISC Turkish  ] Embassy Participants: Ambassador [PER Engin Soysal  ] , [PER DCM Semih Luffu Turgut  ] , [ORG Army/Air Attache Colonel Nuri Gayir  ] , [ORG Naval Attache Erhan Sensoy  ] , and Second Secretary [PER Ilker Kucukkurt  ] . 
US Mission Participants: Ambassador [PER Anne Patterson  ] , [PER DCM Jerry Feierstein  ] , [ORG RAO  ] Chief [PER John Bennett  ] , [ORG Army Attache Scott Taylor  ] , and [PER PolOff Terry Steers-Gonzalez  ] ( notetaker ) . 
Their Trilaterals - - - - - - - - - <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Soysal  ] described the trilateral meetings by [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] , dating back to April 2007 . 
Those three meetings had been kept relatively “small and focused , ” he said ; each had its own theme -- ( 1 ) dialogue , ( 2 ) development , and ( 3 ) security and intelligence . 
The next trilateral meeting , date to be determined , will focus on education . 
Though [PER Soysal  ] admitted the three countries’ education systems were quite different , the exchange was meant to build trust and transparency . 
He emphasized the meeting would be formatted as parallel bilateral discussions rather than true trilats. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOT  ] had witnessed first-hand a deterioration in the relationship between the [MISC Karzai-Musharraf  ] administrations over the first three trilaterals , [PER Soysal  ] revealed . 
Since Zardari’s presidency , he had observed much improved relations , relatively , between the two countries . 
While President [PER Asif Zardari  ] deserved some recognition for this positive turn , [PER Soysal  ] credited principally Prime Minister [PER Yousuf Gilani  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Shah Mehmood Qureshi  ] . 
They both exhibited “geographic sensitivity , ” he added , playing up their moderate [MISC Sufi  ] credentials and raising universal and/or conciliatory themes. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Soysal  ] was proud the [MISC Turkish-sponsored  ] trilaterals had [LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 00001118 002 OF 003 matured beyond joint statements ; now , the three countries needed to implement their decisions . 
There had already been trilateral training opportunities , he added , including on crisis response , counter-narcotics , and public affairs topics . 
He also mentioned a number of proposals he hoped would materialize soon , including a “joint” community center in [LOC Peshawar  ] and a development center in [LOC Ankara  ] . 
He thought the latter would welcome the visits of [MISC American  ] experts . 
[LOC Turkey  ] was additionally proposing a trilateral military exercise or war game. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) Ambassador [PER Patterson  ] briefed [PER Soysal  ] on our own recent trilateral summit . 
The [MISC U.S.-Afghanistan-Pakistan  ] meetings complemented Turkey’s process begun years before . 
President [PER Zardari  ] had performed well in a high-stakes situation . 
The Ambassador thought President Obama’s focus on counter-insurgency , good governance , and overall support had been received well by the [MISC Pakistanis  ] . 
The [ORG RAO  ] Chief noted that Turkey’s trilateral on [MISC Af-Pak  ] intelligence cooperation may have gone better than our own trilateral consultations . 
The Ambassador highlighted the transit trade agreement and the commitment to increased border controls and cross-border training . 
Our next trilateral would likely come in October , the Ambassador mentioned. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [LOC Turkey  ] was receptive to Zardari’s suggestion for a regional summit , not just trilateral , to include all of [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] neighbors , said [PER Soysal  ] . 
He confirmed the [MISC Iran-Afghanistan-Pakistan  ] summit set for May 19 had been postponed to May 24 . 
He recommended [LOC Pakistan  ] reach out to even more international partners and suggested [MISC Pakistani  ] parliamentarians , not just [MISC GOP  ] officials , travel abroad to push [MISC Pakistan’s  ] case . 
[PER Zardari  ] would address [ORG NATO  ] members at a special session in June . 
Of course , [PER Soysal  ] added , [PER Zardari  ] might demur depending on how the [ORG Army  ] offensive was going in [LOC Swat  ] . 
Friends of [LOC Pakistan  ] - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Speaking of the calendar , [PER Soysal  ] turned to the “Friends of [MISC Democratic  ] Pakistan” initiative , informing the Ambassador that the [MISC GOP  ] aimed for a July ministerial in [LOC Istanbul  ] . 
( Comment: We have conveyed to the [LOC Turks  ] our own concerns that there is not sufficient time to prepare for a ministerial in mid-July . 
We will continue to discuss . 
) The [MISC British  ] would likely propose a Friends summit on the margins of the usual September UN General Assembly session of heads of government , [PER Soysal  ] relayed . 
[ORG U.N.  ] Assistant Secretary General [PER Jean Arnault  ] would arrive in [LOC Pakistan  ] on May 21 ; he had attended the [MISC Friends/Donors  ] meeting hosted by [LOC Japan  ] in late April . 
[PER Soysal  ] hoped he , as well as the Ambassador , would encourage the [MISC GOP  ] to stand-up a secretariat for “Friends.” While the assignment of [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] spokesman [PER Abdul Basit  ] as [MISC GOP  ] POC was positive , [PER Soysal  ] really advocated a taskforce. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [ORG DCM  ] stressed that Friends not morph in to a donors forum , which was the [MISC GOP’s  ] inclination . 
Also , membership in the group had expanded and may now be too broad to work as a coherent group , he added . 
Lastly , it would be up to the [MISC GOP  ] to provide the initiative its “strategic vision.” The [ORG DCM  ] encouraged the [MISC Turkish  ] Ambassador to convey similar messages to the [MISC GOP  ] . 
[PER Soysal  ] concurred: “They have to hear from us.” Initiatives for [ORG NATO  ] - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The [MISC Turkish  ] Embassy in [LOC Islamabad  ] has taken on the task of [ORG NATO  ] coordinator , at least on political issues , among members’ missions and with the [MISC GOP  ] . 
In that informal role , [PER Soysal  ] recommended a number of joint initiatives and exchanges . 
He thought members’ respective ambassadors to [ORG NATO  ] should jointly visit [LOC Pakistan  ] soon . 
He also noted [MISC Pakistani  ] journalists and academics were being sent on study tours ( similar to our [ORG International Visitors Program  ] ) to [ORG NATO  ] headquarters in [LOC Brussels  ] . 
[PER Soysal  ] welcomed [LOC U.S.  ] suggestions on suitable [MISC Pakistani  ] candidates for the trips . 
Lastly , he had recently learned that a number of [MISC Pakistani  ] universities conducted model [ORG U.N.  ] competitions ; he felt his and other [ORG NATO  ] members’ missions could sponsor such events . 
[LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 00001118 003 OF 003 <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [MISC Turkish  ] Ambassador [PER Soysal  ] noted President Obama’s recent trip to [LOC Turkey  ] had been very positive and hoped for increased coordination between our two countries and embassies on a spectrum of issues and beyond traditional fora . 
He also noted his government’s recent hosting of other Special Representatives to this region . 
The [MISC IDP Challenge  ] - - - - - - - - - <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) The [MISC Turkish  ] Ambassador complimented the [LOC U.S.  ] on its May 19 announcement to provide $110 million in direct assistance to [MISC Pakistan’s  ] internally displaced ( IDPs ) . 
He revealed [MISC Turkish  ] President [PER Abdullah Gul  ] would call [PER Zardari  ] May 22 to offer a support package as well . 
He hinted that [MISC Turkish  ] aid may be geared to the post-emergency phase in [LOC August/September  ] , which would also coincide this year with the holy month of [LOC Ramadan  ] . 
[PER Soysal  ] noted that [LOC Turkey  ] would be the first ( and so far only ) [MISC Muslim  ] country to assist [LOC Pakistan  ] with this humanitarian crisis ; he was perplexed that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] had not ponied up yet . 
The [MISC GOT  ] would encourage , at the least , a strong statement of support by the [ORG Organization of Islamic Conference  ] ( [ORG OIC  ] ) summit during the week of May 25 and was hoping other [ORG OIC  ] members would kick in contributions , [PER Soysal  ] said. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) However , it appeared the [MISC GOP  ] did not have a clear timeline for the offensive operations in [LOC Swat  ] , [ORG Northwest Frontier Province  ] ( [ORG NWFP  ] ) , [PER Soysal  ] complained . 
He agreed with the Ambassador that the [MISC GOP  ] also needed to identify competent civil administrators to enter recently cleared towns . 
[PER Soysal  ] was also concerned that the [LOC Pakistan  ] [ORG Army  ] was moving too slowly to clear militants from other districts and the [ORG Waziristan Agencies  ] in the [LOC Federally Administered Tribal Areas  ] ( [LOC FATA  ] ) . 
[MISC GOP  ] plans were still “broad brush” and may not realistically be implemented , if at all , until the new year , he analyzed . 
The Ambassador added that 2500 [MISC Waziri  ] families had already reportedly fled their homes in anticipation of [ORG Army  ] action , but yet , the [MISC GOP  ] refused to give international aid organizations access to the nearest settled district of [PER D.I. Khan  ] , forcing families to move north to [LOC Peshawar  ] or farther east into [LOC Punjab  ] . 
Thoughts on [PER Nawaz  ] - - - - - - - - - <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Soysal  ] met one-on-one with opposition [LOC Pakistan  ] [MISC Muslim League-N  ] ( [MISC PML-N  ] ) leader [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] in [LOC Lahore  ] the week of May 11 . 
[PER Nawaz  ] understood the seriousness of the situation in [LOC Swat  ] , [PER Soysal  ] concluded . 
He reported that [PER Nawaz  ] stated the [MISC Taliban  ] should be “eliminated.” [PER Nawaz  ] warned , however , that [MISC Pakistan’s  ] democracy needed to deliver soon before the public looked again to alternatives ; [PER Soysal  ] did not specify whether [PER Nawaz  ] implied the military or the militants as the likely alternates. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) While tit-for-tat politics would eventually return , [PER Soysal  ] thought the international community should encourage for as long as possible a non-partisan stance by [MISC Pakistan’s  ] political parties . 
But [PER Zardari  ] held much of the responsibility for setting the tone , [PER Soysal  ] argued . 
He should bring all parties into major decision-making , host party leaders for a session of the next “Friends” meeting , and reconcile with factions inside his own [ORG Pakistan People’s Party  ] ( [ORG PPP  ] ) . <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Comment: This was the first meeting between the two embassies in this format , which parallels a similar dialogue we have with the [ORG U.K. High Commission  ] . 
But with the [LOC Turks  ] playing an increasingly high profile , constructive role in [LOC Pakistan  ] , we will continue to develop our dialogue and find opportunities to work together in areas of mutual interest . 
As a moderate , progressive [MISC Muslim  ] state featuring relatively stable , democratic governance , [LOC Turkey  ] is well-positioned to be a much more positive role model for the [MISC Pakistanis  ] and to neutralize somewhat the more negative influence on [MISC Pakistani  ] politics and society exercised by [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
End comment .
