08 [LOC HARARE  ] 1035 Classified By: Ambassador [PER James D. McGee  ] for reason 1.4 ( d ) ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , poloff met with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] region that contains the diamond-rich [ORG Marange  ] fields , to discuss violence in the region as well as recent developments in the turbulent [ORG Marange  ] diamond trade . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] described how the military expansion in [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] in late November has been displacing the police and diverting the diamond flow from the [ORG Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe  ] to the [MISC Zimbabwean  ] military . 
This has not deterred the continued brisk diamond trade involving foreign buyers , including most prominently the [MISC Lebanese  ] . 
END SUMMARY. ------------------------------------ Shootings Continue as Bodies [PER Pile Up  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The tribal chief [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , met with poloff in [LOC Harare  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and confirmed that military and police shootings in [ORG Marange  ] are continuing , as security forces tighten their control over the diamond-rich area . 
This was seconded by a report we received from a human rights group in the region ( REF A ) . 
According to the report , during police and military [MISC Operation Hakudzokwi  ] , ( [PER Shona  ] for " you won't come back " ) which was aimed at clearing individual panners from the area , over 200 bodies turned up at [LOC Mutare Provincial Hospital  ] Mortuary , [LOC Old Mutare Mission Hospital  ] , [LOC Sakubva District Hospital  ] , and private mortuaries . 
Many of those bodies arrived with fatal gunshot or dog bite wounds and were tagged " BID [ORG Marange  ] " or " brought in dead from [ORG Marange  ] . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] many of his people have been killed , beaten , and arrested for dealing in diamonds . 
The villagers had entrusted their diamond findings to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] because he owned a safe and they thought his tribal status would be respected ; however , the police forced him to turn over the village 's diamond stash to the security forces . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is now in hiding in [LOC Harare  ] . 
He also told us [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] he had been harassed , arrested , and beaten beat out . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] END NOTE . 
) ---------------------------------------- Military Expansion Displacing the Police ---------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] confirmed that the military has increased its numbers in the region and now exceeds the police presence by a large margin . 
He suspected the increase stemmed from concern that the power-sharing negotiations between [MISC ZANU-PF  ] and the [ORG MDC  ] might culminate in the awarding of the Home [LOC HARARE  ] 00000024 002 OF 003 Affairs ministry--which includes the police department--to the [ORG MDC  ] . 
This would result in a tremendous loss of wealth and patronage that helps to maintain the [PER Mugabe  ] regime . 
Therefore , he believed that the military , which would remain under [MISC ZANU-PF  ] control in the event of an agreement between the two parties , was seeking to consolidate its authority. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Digging by panners , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , is continuing in [ORG Marange  ] largely under the supervision of the military . 
The typical practice is for soldiers to supervise and escort groups of panners as they dig . 
Then at the end of the day , any diamonds found are apportioned between soldiers and diggers . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that military helicopters fly in daily and transport many of the diamonds to bases near [LOC Harare  ] , where presumably they are taken by senior military commanders. -------------------------------------- [PER Gono  ] May Have [MISC Been Cut Out of the Deal  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Prior to the military expansion in late November , it was well known by locals that [ORG Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe  ] ( [ORG RBZ  ] ) governor [PER Gideon Gono  ] had representatives in [LOC Mutare  ] buying diamonds with bundles of freshly-printed [MISC Zimbabwean  ] notes ( Ref B ) . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] claimed that the military has now barred [PER Gono  ] 's operatives from the region and that diamonds are no longer being sent to the [ORG RBZ  ] . 
All diamond purchases are now being conducted solely in foreign exchange . 
( NOTE: According to an article in the state-controlled newspaper , the [ORG Herald  ] , [PER Tendai Makurumidzi  ] , a well-known [PER Gono  ] buyer who uses the alias " [MISC Gonyeti  ] " was arrested sometime in November and had three of his vehicles seized . 
END NOTE . 
) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained that it used to be common to see 4x4 vehicles leaving [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , but now the roads have deteriorated to the point that access is only possible by foot or helicopter . 
Vehicular access to the greater area is also being controlled by police and military roadblocks , according to [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX.  ] ----------------------- Foreign Buying Unabated ----------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) While [PER Gono  ] 's access to diamonds may have been compromised , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that many diamonds are still being sold to foreign diamond buyers in [LOC Mutare  ] and over the border in [LOC Mozambique  ] by a mix of panners , police , and soldiers . 
In particular , [MISC Lebanese  ] buyers have set up shop in large numbers in [LOC Mutare  ] and typically pay for the diamonds with [LOC U.S.  ] dollars . 
In order to operate safely , the [MISC Lebanese  ] have formed profitable relationships with senior military and police officials in the region . 
Marginally more reputable buyers from [LOC Europe  ] and other regions prefer to stay in [LOC Chimoio  ] in [LOC Mozambique  ] . 
[LOC Chimoio  ] affords these buyers protection from [MISC Zimbabwean  ] police and soldiers who commonly seize cash , diamonds , and vehicles from them in [LOC Mutare  ] , but that safety is offset by higher diamond prices. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) We previously reported on a meeting between [PER Gono  ] and the [MISC Russian  ] diamond monopoly [ORG ALROSA  ] ( Ref C ) in November . 
Recent press reports , corroborated by Embassy sources , [LOC HARARE  ] 00000024 003 OF 003 indicate that [PER Mugabe  ] is planning a trip to [LOC Russia  ] in January to discuss mining investment opportunities . 
With the [ORG GOZ  ] desperate for forex , such a trip could involve discussion of a [MISC Chiadzwa  ] diamond deal between [LOC Zimbabwe  ] and [LOC Russia  ] . 
END COMMENT .
