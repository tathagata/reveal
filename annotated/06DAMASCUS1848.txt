( C ) [ORG Summary:  ] The [ORG SARG  ] continues to play with the issue of [MISC Islam  ] -- in the wake of its February use of mob violence against several [MISC European  ] embassies -- in ways designed to shore up support for the regime . 
In the past month there have been numerous reports about regime outreach to the [MISC Islamic  ] community , including presidential approval of a [ORG Sharia  ] law faculty at [ORG Aleppo University  ] , the licensing of three [MISC Islamic  ] banks , and allowing for the first time a prominent [MISC Islamic  ] figure to lecture at the [ORG Higher Military Academy  ] in [LOC Damascus  ] . 
While there were also [ORG SARG  ] efforts during this period that pointed towards stepped-up measures to counter rising [MISC Islamist  ] influence , including restrictions on activities permitted at mosques ( announced and then quickly walked back ) , the basic thrust of the policy was to manipulate [MISC Islamic  ] elements to shore up the regime , as well as prevent former VP [PER Abdul Halim Khaddam  ] and [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] leader [PER Sadreddine Bayanouni  ] from developing any traction in the [MISC Sunni  ] community . 
Although some contacts believe the regime is playing with fire , they assess that it sees itself under threat and is willing to take serious risks . 
While alarmist scenarios about the rising tide of [MISC Islamism  ] may be true , the [ORG SARG  ] seems for the time being to be successfully manipulating this [MISC Islam  ] issue . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) After an initial appeal to [MISC Syrian  ] nationalism in the period between the release of the two [MISC Mehlis  ] reports , the [ORG SARG  ] gradually shifted to [MISC Islamic  ] themes to mobilize support for the regime and counter the pressure created by the [MISC UNIIIC  ] investigation . 
The [ORG SARG  ] 's February decision to manipulate the [MISC Danish  ] cartoons controversy by permitting large demonstrations in front of [MISC European  ] embassies led to rioting crowds that heavily damaged four embassies . 
That result offered [LOC Syria  ] the opportunity to portray itself , internally and regionally , as the leading defender of [MISC Islam  ] 's dignity. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) RECENT [ORG SARG  ] [ORG ISLAMIC OUTREACH:  ] In the past month there has been a spate of reports about regime activity that seems designed to follow up in a quieter manner on this effort . 
[PER Asad  ] in mid-April signed a decree permitting the establishment of a [ORG Sharia  ] ( [MISC Islamic  ] law ) faculty at [ORG Aleppo University  ] , a step the [ORG SARG  ] reportedly avoided in the past over fears about powerful ( [MISC Sunni  ] ) [MISC Islamist  ] influence in [LOC Aleppo  ] . 
The government also announced a decision , the first of its kind , to license three private [MISC Islamic  ] banks ( ref A ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Also in early April , in an unprecedented move , the regime allowed a sheikh , moderate [MISC Islamist  ] MP [PER Mohammed Habash  ] , to address the officers at the [ORG Higher Military Academy  ] in [LOC Damascus  ] , with the attendance of the Minister of Defense , as well as the [ORG Grand Mufti  ] and other religious figures . 
In [PER Habash  ] 's widely publicized remarks , he stated that ( secular ) [MISC Arab  ] nationalism and [MISC Islam  ] are consistent and should be used to form a common front to face the challenges of defending the country and the [MISC Arab  ] homeland . 
He also called for a new political parties law that would permit the formation of [MISC Islamic  ] parties . 
In the run-up to the mid-April celebration of the Prophet 's birthday , the [ORG SARG  ] and its proxies re-decorated the city of [LOC Damascus  ] with a new set of official-looking banners accentuating religious themes , the first time in recent memory that such an organized display has taken place on this holiday . 
According to contacts , [ORG SARG  ] officials pressured businessman and shopkeepers to put up the banners , which were also displayed at mosques and government buildings . 
( Note: Two weeks later , the banners remain prominently on display in the city 's central market . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) ALSO SOME [ORG SARG  ] REPRESSION: It should be noted that there were also [ORG SARG  ] efforts during this period that pointed , at least to some degree , in the opposite direction , towards stepped-up [ORG SARG  ] efforts to counter rising [MISC Islamist  ] influence . 
In March , for example , the head of the [LOC Damascus  ] section of the [ORG Ministry of the Islamic Endowments  ] ( [ORG Awqaaf  ] ) issued a list of ten restrictions on activities at mosques , limiting the hours of operation to times of prayer , preventing any unauthorized speakers or activities , including the collection of donations , and requiring the lowering of the volume of loudspeakers used in the calls to prayer at dawn and in the afternoon . 
Most of this list was reportedly cobbled together [LOC DAMASCUS  ] 00001848 002 OF 003 from previous restrictions the [ORG SARG  ] had issued over the years , through the [ORG Awqaaf Ministry  ] , that had not been uniformly enforced. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [MISC ISLAMIC  ] LEADERS PROTEST: In reaction to this measure , the regime-tolerant [MISC Sunni Islamic  ] establishment protested angrily to their friends inside the regime -- including senior officials in the security services -- at what they viewed as an unnecessary , clumsy effort to rein them in . 
Sheikh [PER Salah Kuftaro  ] , head of the influential [ORG Abu Noor Institute  ] , told [PER Polchief  ] that he had protested against the newly issued restrictions , which he dubbed the " Ten Commandments , " to the [LOC Damascus  ] chief of [ORG Syrian Military Intelligence  ] after the Minister of the [ORG Awqaaf  ] indicated reluctance to rescind the directive . 
[PER Kuftaro  ] told [PER Polchief  ] he had received a commitment from his contacts in the intelligence services that the directive " had been frozen , " but not rescinded . 
( Comment: Some conspiratorial-minded observers insist the regime deliberately had the [ORG Awqaaf  ] put out the list of restrictions so that it could then show its good will towards the [MISC Islamic  ] community by agreeing to disregard its own rules . 
The evidence , however , points to the somewhat messier process detailed above . 
) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) A COMPLICATED DYNAMIC: This push-pull dynamic , with the regime encouraging " moderate " [MISC Islamists  ] on the one hand , while repressing what it perceives to be a threatening [MISC Islamist  ] minority ( and threatening [MISC Islamic  ] aspects in general ) on the other , is not new ( refs B , C , and D ) . 
The [PER Asad  ] regime has practiced some version of it since the early 1980 's -- after it violently suppressed the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] -- as a way to woo back the [MISC Sunni  ] community , while preventing the development of any [MISC Islamist  ] political competition . 
This dynamic has always been reflected in a messy process on the ground , with sometimes overzealous [ORG SARG  ] officials repressing too much or in the wrong places , followed by push-back from the [MISC Islamic  ] establishment , and an adjustment by the regime . 
According to astute regime observer [PER Ayman Abdul Noor  ] , a Ba'athist reformer , this has occurred at key junctures like the present moment , when senior regime figures " who are in the picture , " know and understand the policy of manipulating and using the [MISC Islamists  ] to shore up the regime , while the mass of lower-level officials continue with enforcing the standard policy of " reining in the [MISC Islamic  ] crowd . 
" <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) REGIME PLAYING WITH FIRE: Overall , despite some contradictions , it seems evident that the regime is reaching out once again to the [MISC Sunni Islamic  ] community with various initiatives and adopting some elements of an [MISC Islamic  ] populism to shore up support . 
According to gadfly economist and former deputy minister of planning [PER Riad Abrash  ] , the regime has calculated now that [MISC Arab  ] nationalist interests " are identical " with the [MISC Islamic  ] population 's desire , both in [LOC Syria  ] and the region , to oppose the [LOC U.S.  ] In his view , the regime " is getting closer to the view of people on the street " in order to retain its popularity . 
The regime recognizes the powerful hold that [MISC Islam  ] has on the masses , said [PER Abrash  ] . 
He acknowledged that the regime " is playing with fire , " but noted " they want to survive . 
They feel threatened , so it makes sense to take dangerous steps . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) ONLY WEAK FELLOW PLAYERS ALLOWED: Despite the willingness to take risks with [MISC Islam  ] now , the regime wants to ensure that it controls the game and manipulates all the players , for its own interests . 
For that reason , the [PER Asad  ] regime is not willing to make any deal with the [ORG Muslim Brothers  ] even if it might bring more [MISC Sunni  ] support for the regime . 
" They want to play with the religious issue themselves . 
They don't want to cede it to potential competitors , " explained [PER Abrash.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) REGIME MOTIVATIONS: Other observers agree that international pressure on the regime over the past year has put it on the defensive . 
According to dissident Yassin [PER Haj Saleh  ] , the regime is " relatively relaxed " in the short term ( prior to the June release of [ORG Brammertz  ] 's second report ) , but in the longer term , " sees itself in a life-threatening struggle with the [LOC U.S.  ] , " which makes it willing to ally itself closely with [LOC Iran  ] , for example , and to curry favor with [MISC Islamists  ] in [LOC Syria  ] . 
The regime has made sure to champion the [MISC Palestinian  ] cause ( through its support of [ORG Hamas  ] ) , as well as that of [ORG Hizballah  ] , and has been sufficiently supportive of the insurgency in [LOC Iraq  ] over the past few years , all to ensure , according to [PER Abdul Noor  ] , that [LOC DAMASCUS  ] 00001848 003 OF 003 [MISC Islamists  ] " have no political case to take to the street and attack the regime . 
" The [ORG SARG  ] also seems motivated by the desire to prevent former VP [PER Khaddam  ] and [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] leader [ORG Bayanouni  ] , with their [ORG National Salvation Front  ] , from developing any traction in the [MISC Sunni  ] community . 
Finally , unidentified [ORG Ba'ath Party  ] officials , echoing [PER Habash  ] 's moderate [MISC Islamist  ] view , have noted in the press recently that there is room for dialogue between secular Ba'athists and moderate [MISC Islamists  ] , while such dialogue with [MISC Islamic  ] radicals is impossible. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) WEAKNESSES OF THE APPROACH: [PER Saleh  ] and others identify several weaknesses in the [ORG SARG  ] approach . 
According to [PER Saleh  ] , [LOC Syria  ] needs a moderate [MISC Islamic  ] political party , which would force the [MISC Islamists  ] to deal responsibly with political issues . 
" It can't be avoided , but the regime wants to jump over this step . 
" The regime prefers an [MISC Islamic  ] establishment dependent on it for favors and subservient to its politics , rather than " a free-thinking , independent group . 
" Consequently the [ORG SARG  ] is willing to accept -- its policies in fact actually end up encouraging -- close-minded , very conservative [MISC Islamic  ] institutions , as long as they are subservient to the regime . 
This phenomenon , however , causes some [MISC Islamic  ] elements to become more radical and extreme in the longer term , as a way to attack the co-optation , insisted [PER Saleh.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) In addition , the overall " street power " of [MISC Islam  ] is increasing by the day in [LOC Syria  ] , according to [MISC Damascus-based  ] al-Hayat correspondent [PER Ibrahim Hamidi  ] . 
In his view , the regime 's tactics already betray a nervousness and defensiveness in the way it addresses [MISC Islamic  ] issues . 
According to [PER Hamidi  ] , the rising tide of [MISC Islamism  ] in [LOC Syria  ] is likely eventually to overwhelm the regime and its secular orientation . 
As an example of the rising tide of [MISC Islamic  ] religious fervor which the regime is nervously observing and trying to control , he pointed to relatively new women 's [MISC Islamic  ] movement in [LOC Syria  ] , the [LOC Qubasyat  ] , with thousands of adherents ( see septel ) . <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) COMMENT: While alarmist scenarios about the future rising tide of [MISC Islamism  ] may be true , the [ORG SARG  ] seems for the time being to be successfully manipulating this [MISC Islam  ] issue , occasionally blending in some populist aspects . 
The regime is well-positioned politically because of its championing of [MISC Islamic  ] political causes such as those of [ORG Hamas  ] , [ORG Hizballah  ] , and [LOC Iran  ] , and has adopted a sufficiently nuanced policy on [LOC Iraq  ] to immunize it against criticism that it is helping suppress an [MISC Islamic  ] insurgency . 
Nevertheless , some [MISC Sunni  ] leaders tell us that the regime 's attempts to manipulate the [MISC Islam  ] issue are not credible and that people are not taken in by it . 
Where the [ORG SARG  ] has been effective is in keeping [MISC Islamic  ] leaders in [LOC Syria  ] under its wing , supported and politically muzzled . 
The more populist touches seem designed to drown out the unwelcome noise coming from the [ORG Brammertz  ] investigation and -- in tandem with appeals to [MISC Syrian  ] nationalism -- to persuade [MISC Syrians  ] that it is not the regime ( and [PER Asad  ] family ) under attack but the country and the [MISC Islamic  ] nation .
