<code><pre>S E C R E T ISLAMABAD 002295 NOFORN EO 12958 DECL: 09/23/2034 TAGS PGOV , PREL , PTER , PINR , MOPS , EAID , PK SUBJECT: REVIEWING OUR [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] - [LOC PAKISTAN  ] STRATEGY Classified By: Ambassador [PER Anne W. Patterson  ] , Reasons 1.4 b and d <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary: In response to queries posed by the [ORG National Security Council  ] , [ORG Embassy Islamabad  ] believes that it is not/not possible to counter al-Qaeda in [LOC Pakistan  ] absent a comprehensive strategy that 1 ) addresses the interlinked [ORG Taliban  ] threat in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] , 2 ) brings about stable , civilian government in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and 3 ) reexamines the broader role of [LOC India  ] in the region . 
As the queries presuppose , the ending of [MISC Pakistani  ] establishment support to terrorist and extremist groups , some [MISC Afghan-focused  ] and some [MISC India-focused  ] , is a key element for success . 
There is no chance that [LOC Pakistan  ] will view enhanced assistance levels in any field as sufficient compensation for abandoning support to these groups , which it sees as an important part of its national security apparatus against [LOC India  ] . 
The only way to achieve a cessation of such support is to change the [LOC Pakistan  ] government’s own perception of its security requirements . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Al-Qaeda can operate in [LOC Pakistan’s Federally Administered Tribal Areas  ] ( [LOC FATA  ] ) largely because the [MISC Taliban-related  ] groups in these areas continue to challenge the writ of the [MISC Pakistani  ] government . 
Unilateral targeting of al-Qaeda operatives and assets in these regions is an important component of dealing with the overall threat . 
It is not/not , however , sufficient in and of itself to force al-Qaeda out of the [LOC FATA  ] , so long as the territory remains largely ungoverned space . 
Increased unilateral operations in these areas risk destabilizing the [MISC Pakistani  ] state , alienating both the civilian government and military leadership , and provoking a broader governance crisis in [LOC Pakistan  ] without finally achieving the goal . 
To be effective , we must extend the writ of the [MISC Pakistani  ] state into the [LOC FATA  ] in such a way that [ORG Taliban  ] groups can no longer offer effective protection to al-Qaeda from [MISC Pakistan’s  ] own security and law enforcement agencies in these areas . 
We should be under no illusion , however , that this effort will not require a multi-year , multi-agency effort. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Taliban  ] groups in [LOC Pakistan  ] and the regional threat posed by al-Qaeda , however , cannot be effectively dealt with absent a broader regional strategy that leads to stability in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Fear that the [MISC ISAF  ] mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] will end without the establishment of a non-Taliban , [MISC Pakhtoon-led  ] government friendly to [LOC Pakistan  ] adds to the [MISC Pakistani  ] establishment’s determination not to cut its ties irrevocably to the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Taliban  ] . 
They fear that withdrawals of [ORG NATO  ] countries on a date certain from [LOC Afghanistan  ] is only the thin edge of a wedge that will be followed by other coalition partners , including the [LOC United States  ] . 
Discussions of deadlines , downsizing of the [MISC American  ] military presence , or even a denial of the additional troops reportedly to be requested by [PER Gen. McChrystal  ] are taken as evidence that reinforces this perception . 
General [PER Kayani  ] has been utterly frank about [MISC Pakistan’s  ] position on this . 
In such a scenario , the [LOC Pakistan  ] establishment will dramatically increase support for [ORG Taliban  ] groups in [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] , which they see either as ultimately likely to take over the [MISC Afghan  ] government or at least an important counter-weight to an [LOC Indian-controlled  ] [ORG Northern Alliance.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Most importantly , it is the perception of [LOC India  ] as the primary threat to the [MISC Pakistani  ] state that colors its perceptions of the conflict in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [MISC Pakistan’s  ] security needs . 
The [MISC Pakistani  ] establishment fears a pro-India government in [LOC Afghanistan  ] would allow [LOC India  ] to operate a proxy war against [LOC Pakistan  ] from its territory . 
Justified or not , increased [MISC Indian  ] investment in , trade with , and development support to the [MISC Afghan  ] government , which the [ORG USG  ] has encouraged , causes [LOC Pakistan  ] to embrace [ORG Taliban  ] groups all the more closely as anti-India allies . 
We need to reassess [MISC Indian  ] involvement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and our own policies towards [LOC India  ] , including the growing military relationship through sizable conventional arms sales , as all of this feeds [MISC Pakistani  ] establishment paranoia and pushes them closer to both [MISC Afghan  ] and [MISC Kashmir-focused  ] terrorist groups while reinforcing doubts about [LOC U.S.  ] intentions . 
Resolving the [LOC Kashmir  ] dispute , which lies at the core of [MISC Pakistan’s  ] support for terrorist groups , would dramatically improve the situation . 
Enhanced [ORG USG  ] efforts in this regard should be considered. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Money alone will not/not solve the problem of al-Qaeda or the [ORG Taliban  ] operating in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
A grand bargain that promises development or military assistance in exchange for severing ties will be insufficient to wean [LOC Pakistan  ] from policies that reflect accurately its most deep-seated fears . 
The [MISC Pakistani  ] establishment , as we saw in 1998 with the nuclear test , does not view assistance -- even sizable assistance to their own entities -- as a trade-off for national security vis-a-vis [LOC India  ] . 
The lack of faith in [ORG USG  ] intentions in [LOC Pakistan  ] and in relation to [LOC India  ] makes such a bargain untenable in the eyes of the [MISC Pakistani  ] establishment . 
Development assistance in the context of the [MISC Pakistani  ] counter-insurgency strategy must be accelerated and refined in order to extend the government writ to the [LOC FATA  ] , to stabilize regions at-risk for insurgent activity and recruitment , and to offer incentives for those that desire to leave terrorist groups . 
It can and should not/not be viewed as a pay-off for behavior change by the [MISC Pakistani  ] establishment. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In the final analysis there is no short-cut to dealing with the al-Qaeda problem in [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
It is inextricably linked to and cannot be divorced from the [ORG Taliban  ] problem in both countries . 
Nor can we hope to develop a strategy for minimizing [ORG Taliban  ] influence and thereby al-Qaeda operational space in [MISC Pakistan’s  ] [ORG FATA  ] absent a strategy that brings about stability in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ; the notion that precision or long-range counter-terrorism efforts can suffice are equally illusory . 
[MISC Afghan  ] instability by definition leads the [MISC Pakistani  ] establishment to increase support for the [ORG Taliban  ] and thereby , unintentionally , create space for al-Qaeda . 
No amount of money will sever that link . 
Rather , we must reassess our regional approach and find ways to reassure the [MISC Pakistanis  ] that they can address their long-standing national security objectives most effectively -- both to the east and to the west -- by working closely with the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC PATTERSON SECRET</pre></code>  ]
