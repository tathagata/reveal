( U ) March 28 , 2009 ; 8:30 am ; [PER Vina del Mar  ] , [LOC Chile.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Participants: [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Joseph Biden  ] , [ORG Vice President  ] [PER Antony Blinken  ] , [ORG National Security Advisor  ] to the [ORG Vice  ] President [PER Brian McKeon  ] , [ORG Deputy National Security Advisor  ] to the [ORG Vice  ] President [PER Brian Harris  ] ( notetaker ) , Political/Economic Officer , [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [LOC Guatemala City United Kingdom  ] [PER Gordon Brown  ] , Prime Minister [PER Thomas Fletcher  ] , Private Secretary to the Prime Minister [PER Stuart Wood  ] , [ORG Special Advisor  ] to the Prime Minister [PER Douglas Alexander  ] , Secretary of State for [ORG International Development  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] During a bilateral meeting on the margins of the [ORG Progressive Governance Leaders Summit  ] in [LOC Chile  ] , [ORG Vice  ] President [PER Joseph Biden  ] and [MISC British  ] Prime Minister [PER Gordon Brown  ] discussed the economic crisis in terms of the upcoming [MISC G-20 Summit  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
On economic issues , [PER Brown  ] pressed [ORG Vice  ] President [PER Biden  ] to push the [MISC Germans  ] to move forward with $250 billion in special drawing rights ( SDRs ) for the [ORG IMF  ] , to use [ORG IMF  ] gold sales to support poorest countries and to take the initiative to restart sectoral negotiations related to [LOC Doha  ] . 
On [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] , Vice President [PER Biden  ] noted our increased troop commitment to [LOC Afghanistan  ] and the need to lower expectations as to what is achievable in [LOC Afghanistan  ] given enormous governance issues . 
End Summary. ------------------------- TRADE AND ECONOMIC ISSUES ------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) PM [PER Brown  ] opened the meeting by thanking [ORG Vice President  ] [PER Biden  ] for recent statement on revising the supervisory structure for the [MISC G-20.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Vice President [PER Biden  ] asked whether capital flight from developing countries would be high on the [MISC G-20  ] agenda and noted that [MISC Argentinean  ] President [PER Fernandez  ] has requested additional assistance without the usual [ORG IMF  ] conditionality . 
[PER Brown  ] responded that he was worried about capital flight , particularly in [ORG Eastern Europe  ] . 
The current financial crisis will test whether [ORG Eastern European  ] nations have developed sufficiently strong institutions since the fall of communism to withstand the downturn politically and socially as well as economically . 
It is a test of whether freedom can be successfully combined with economic stability . 
[ORG IMF  ] conditionality has long been an area of contention for [LOC Latin America  ] and it is not surprising that [LOC Argentina  ] would ask for preventative funds without conditions. ------------------------------ [PER BROWN  ] PRESSES ON [ORG IMF  ] AND TRADE ------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Prime Minister [PER Brown  ] delivered several requests on economic issues to Vice President [PER Biden  ] . 
The first was the need to secure financing for an additional $250 billion in [ORG Special Drawing Rights  ] ( SDRs ) for the [ORG IMF  ] to help vulnerable economies withstand the economic downturn . 
[PER Brown  ] commented that his understanding was this was an amount that the administration could support without the need to consult [ORG Congress  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] support on the issue would be particularly helpful with the [MISC Germans  ] who , as yet , do not support additional SDRs . 
Parallel discussions were going on with [LOC China  ] , [LOC Japan  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , and several other Gulf nations to secure $400 billion in additional financing . 
Rapid approval of the [ORG IMF  ] portion would help catalyze these parallel negotiations. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) PM [PER Brown  ] also noted that the [ORG IMF  ] was being forced to sell gold to raise funds to pay its administrative staff . 
There had been far fewer loan programs this decade than in the 1990s . 
The result was reduced revenue from countries repaying loans and a consequent budget shortfall . 
There is a [PER SANTIAGO  ] 00000324 002.2 OF 003 pending sale of $11 billion in [ORG IMF  ] gold that should be used to help the poorest countries rather than pay [ORG IMF  ] staff . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] position had been that interest from gold reserves could be devoted to [ORG IMF  ] programs , but that capital sales should not . 
PM [PER Brown  ] asked Vice President [PER Biden  ] to reconsider this position. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) PM [PER Brown  ] said successfully concluding the [LOC Doha  ] round would be difficult but the [PER Obama  ] administration should agree to deal with environmental and labor commitments outside the formal trading framework in relevant institutions such as the [LOC ILO  ] . 
[PER Brown  ] suggested that if the [LOC United States  ] allowed resumption of the next round of sectoral discussions , it would create momentum for the rest of the world , including [LOC India  ] , to re-engage in the discussions . 
Opening new sectoral discussions on [LOC Doha  ] would garner the [ORG Administration  ] international support without needing to make difficult political compromises or commitments for the time being. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [LOC UK  ] Secretary of State for [ORG International Development  ] [PER Douglas Alexander  ] said it was important to find a way to move forward on the [ORG Doha Agreement  ] . 
Trade discussions are like riding a bike , i.e. , you have to keep moving forward or you fall down . 
If we do not proactively move forward and eventually come to a successful conclusion to the [LOC Doha  ] round , the [LOC United States  ] could be blamed in some quarters . 
The [LOC Doha  ] round was meant to be the &development8 round of negotiations with significant aid from donor nations contingent upon the agreement 's successful conclusion . 
If it did not pass , some governments that stand to lose aid , such as [LOC Brazil  ] , would likely blame the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Vice President [PER Biden  ] did not commit on any of these issues but noted that labor interests in the [LOC United States  ] were not satisfied and were looking to the [ORG Administration  ] to establish its labor &bona fides.8 In a year , he said , movement on economic and trade issues would either be easier or impossible depending on the direction of the world economy. -------------------- [LOC AFGHANISTAN/PAKISTAN  ] -------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Turning to [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] , Vice President [PER Biden  ] described the importance of combating terrorism and noted the different elements of the [PER Obama  ] administration 's policy . 
First , the focus in [LOC Afghanistan  ] is on [ORG Al Qaida  ] . 
The [PER Obama  ] administration will not make an open-ended commitment to building freedom and democracy in [LOC Afghanistan  ] because it is not realistic . 
Second , there is no real possibility of defeating [ORG Al Qaida  ] without also dealing with [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Third , he recognized that the [LOC United States  ] cannot solve the problem on its own . 
The whole world needed to engage. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Vice President [PER Biden  ] said he worried that [ORG NATO  ] countries in [LOC Europe  ] underestimated the threat from the region and viewed the problem as an economic development issue rather than a security issue , despite the fact that [MISC Afghan  ] opium is primarily exported to [LOC Europe  ] and [LOC Europe  ] has been the victim of several terrorist attacks originating from the region . 
Vice President [PER Biden  ] described the complex nature of the security problem in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , commenting that &besides the demography , geography and history of the region , we have a lot going for us.8 <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Vice President [PER Biden  ] noted that the current [LOC U.S.  ] commitment of 63,000 troops to [LOC Afghanistan  ] is the result of a vigorous internal policy debate and would not be sustainable politically for more than two years without visible signs of progress . 
After two years , the extraordinary cost of maintaining a robust military presence in [LOC Afghanistan  ] would make additional commitment increasingly difficult . 
After [MISC Afghan  ] elections the [ORG Administration  ] intends to review the situation again . 
Currently there is little capacity for the [MISC Afghan  ] government to execute many of the functions of government . 
In many areas of the country , local officials have close to no knowledge of how to govern or even basic knowledge of payroll or budget . 
Part of the reason the [ORG Taliban  ] is strengthening is since the [ORG Taliban  ] has the local capacity to settle basic disputes quickly while central government courts can take six to eight months to process a case. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The idea of a strong rule of law under a centralized [PER SANTIAGO  ] 00000324 003.2 OF 003 [MISC Karzai  ] government was not realistic . 
New policy towards the [ORG Taliban  ] should reflect the reality of the [MISC Afghan  ] government 's lack of capacity . 
Our policy should first aim to stabilize the urban areas and surrounding rural communities and then seek to exploit divisions within the [ORG Taliban  ] , co-opting moderate elements rather than simply defeating militarily all elements of the [MISC Taliban.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) On [LOC Pakistan  ] , Vice President [PER Biden  ] commented that it was difficult to convince [LOC Pakistan  ] to commit to developing its counter-insurgency potential . 
The threat from [LOC India  ] leads [LOC Pakistan  ] to devote the bulk of its defense spending to conventional warfare capabilities . 
However , something must be done in the meantime . 
We need to develop our relationship with [LOC Pakistan  ] beyond its current transactional nature to a long-term strategic partnership . 
We should begin with $1.5 billion per year in economic assistance that is unconditional and supplement that with military assistance that is conditioned on the modernization of its command structure and active action in the field to combat insurgents . 
It would be difficult to convince [ORG Congress  ] to support such a plan , particularly the unconditional civilian component. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Vice President [PER Biden  ] noted that the [LOC United States  ] wants to empower the [ORG UN  ] and wants active [MISC European  ] participation in resolving the threats in [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
With the exception of the [LOC UK  ] and a few others , very few [MISC Europeans  ] are taking action . 
[LOC Germany  ] completely dropped the ball on police training but [ORG NATO  ] countries should continue to provide assistance that is within their capacity to deliver. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [PER Brown  ] agreed that there was a significant terrorist threat emanating from the region . 
More than 30,000 [MISC Pakistanis  ] travel back and forth to the [LOC UK  ] each year and two-thirds of the terrorist threats that [LOC UK  ] security forces investigate originate in [LOC Pakistan  ] -- including one on-going investigation . 
The roots of terrorism in [LOC Pakistan  ] are complicated and go beyond the madrasas to , in some areas , a complete societal incitement to militancy . 
[ORG Zedari  ] 's commitment to combating terrorism is unclear , although he always says the right things. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER Brown  ] agreed on the need for a shared commitment and noted that the only way to reduce the threat and eventually draw down [ORG NATO  ] 's commitment to the region was by increasing the capacity of [LOC Afghanistani  ] and [MISC Pakistani  ] security services . 
Dividing the [ORG Taliban  ] would greatly reduce its effectiveness , though doing this made the [LOC Iraq  ] problem look easy by comparison. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( S ) Vice President [PER Biden  ] commented that [ORG Zedari  ] had told him two months ago that ISI director &Kiyani will take me out.8 [PER Brown  ] thought this unlikely and said that [PER Kiyani  ] did not want to be another [PER Musharraf  ] , rather he would give civilian leadership scope to function . 
However , he was wary of the [ORG Sharif  ] brothers and [ORG Zedari.  ] <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( U ) The [ORG Office of the Vice  ] President cleared this message .
