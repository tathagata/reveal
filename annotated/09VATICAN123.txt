( S ) Summary: During his recent visit to [LOC Rome  ] and meeting with the [PER Pope  ] --planned before the [PER Pope  ] urged disaffected [MISC Anglicans  ] to convert to [MISC Catholicism--  ] Archbishop of [ORG Canterbury  ] [PER Rowan Williams  ] challenged the position of the [MISC Catholic  ] Church on ordination of women and made it clear that the [LOC Vatican  ] should have consulted with him before reaching out to the [MISC Anglican  ] community . 
Although Williams’ visit to [LOC Rome  ] was cast as positive and reinforcing of ecumenical dialogue , it’s clear the wounds from this controversy will affect that dialogue negatively ( at least for now ) and are likely to cast a pall over the [MISC Pope’s  ] planned state visit to [LOC England  ] in 2010 . 
End summary Official and [ORG Public Statements Focus  ] on Positive --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Archbishop of [LOC Canterbury  ] , [PER Rowan Williams  ] , met with [PER Pope Benedict XVI  ] on November 21 . 
The meeting was planned before the [LOC Vatican  ] released its new apostolic constitution that facilitates the conversion of [MISC Anglicans  ] to [MISC Catholicism  ] . 
Described as “cordial” by [LOC Vatican  ] officials in an official statement , the [LOC Holy See  ] said “The discussions also focused on recent events affecting relations between the [MISC Catholic  ] Church and the [MISC Anglican  ] Communion , reiterating the shared will to continue and to consolidate the ecumenical relationship between [MISC Catholics  ] and [PER Anglicans.” Notwithstanding  ] this upbeat [LOC Vatican  ] characterization of the meeting , [PER Williams  ] used it to draw clear lines between [MISC Anglican  ] and [MISC Catholic  ] core beliefs . 
He presented the [PER Pope  ] with a copy of a lecture he delivered in [LOC Rome  ] on November 19 , in which he challenged the [MISC Vatican’s  ] position on the ordination of women , the authority of the papacy , and the role and relation of local churches to a centralized governing structure. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Speaking with [ORG Vatican Radio  ] shortly after the meeting , [PER Williams  ] stressed his prior good relations with the [PER Pope  ] and downplayed the importance of the [MISC Vatican’s  ] new procedure for receiving [MISC Anglicans  ] into the [MISC Catholic  ] Church . 
However , he did express misgivings about how the new procedure was announced . 
In order to prevent negative fall-out during the [MISC Pope’s  ] planned 2010 state visit to [LOC England  ] , [PER Williams  ] recommended in the interview that the [PER Pope  ] tread carefully while in [LOC England  ] when discussing the late Cardinal [PER Henry Newman  ] ( 1801-1890 ) . 
( [PER Note: Newman  ] , a convert from [LOC Anglicanism  ] to [MISC Catholicism  ] , may be recognized as a “blessed” model for [MISC Catholics  ] -- beatified -- during the [MISC Pope’s  ] visit . 
) [PER Williams  ] said he had asked the [PER Pope  ] to speak about [PER Newman  ] as a great [MISC British  ] intellectual , and not just as a convert. ~But Private Discussions Reveal a [ORG Deeper Rift  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Archbishop [PER Williams  ] was the guest of honor at a dinner on Nov. 20 hosted by the [MISC British  ] Ambassador to the [LOC Holy See  ] , [PER Francis Campbell  ] , for senior [LOC Vatican  ] officials . 
[PER Campbell  ] told the Ambassador that the tone of the conversation was respectful but at times awkward . 
[PER Campbell  ] ( protect ) believes the [MISC Vatican’s  ] move shifted the goal of the [MISC Catholic-Anglican  ] ecumenical dialogue from true unity to mere cooperation . 
He further noted that some [LOC Vatican  ] officials themselves believe that [PER Williams  ] should have been consulted --instead of simply told-- about the apostolic constitution . 
( [PER Comment: Campbell  ] was probably referring to Cardinal [PER Kasper  ] , who runs the Council for [ORG Christian Unity  ] . 
End Comment ) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) In a subsequent conversation with [ORG DCM  ] after Williams’ departure , [PER Campbell  ] ( strictly protect ) said [MISC Anglican-Vatican  ] relations were facing their worst crisis in 150 years as a result of the [MISC Pope’s  ] decision . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] decision seems to have been aimed primarily at [MISC Anglicans  ] in the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Australia  ] , with little thought given to how it would affect the center of [LOC Anglicanism  ] , [LOC England  ] , or the Archbishop of [LOC Canterbury  ] . 
[PER Benedict XVI  ] , [PER Campbell  ] said , had put [PER Williams  ] in an impossible situation . 
If [PER Williams  ] reacted more forcefully , he would destroy decades of work on ecumenical dialogue ; by not reacting [LOC VATICAN  ] 00000123 002.2 OF 002 more harshly , he has lost support among angry [MISC Anglicans  ] . 
The crisis is also worrisome for [MISC England’s  ] small , mostly [MISC Irish-origin  ] , [MISC Catholic  ] minority , [PER Campbell  ] said . 
There is still latent anti-Catholicism in some parts of [LOC England  ] and it may not take much to set it off . 
The outcome could be discrimination or in isolated cases , even violence , against this minority . 
As for the [MISC Pope’s  ] visit next year to [LOC England  ] , [PER Campbell  ] said he now expected a chilly reception , especially from the Royal family - which was not a great supporter of ecumenical dialogue even before the crisis . 
Comment ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) Williams’ previously planned meeting with the [PER Pope  ] unquestionably came at an awkward time , but was also important that it happen in order to start healing the damage caused by the [MISC Vatican’s  ] outreach to [MISC Anglicans  ] . 
The visit also gave [PER Williams  ] an opportunity to recover some lost stature by challenging the [MISC Catholic  ] Church during his visit . 
As reported previously ( reftel ) , the [LOC Vatican  ] decision to go after disaffected [MISC Anglicans  ] undercut Cardinal [PER Kasper  ] , and it now seems the decision may cast a pall on the [MISC Pope’s  ] visit to [LOC England  ] next year . 
In the end , some may wonder whether the damage to inter-Christian relations was worth it - especially since the number of disaffected [MISC Anglicans  ] that will convert is likely to be a trickle rather than a wave . 
End comment .
