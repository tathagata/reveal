( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [ORG Scottish Executive  ] is scheduled to publicly announce on August 20 its decision to release convicted [PER Pan Am  ] 103 bomber [PER Abdel Basset Ali  ] [PER Mohamed Al-Megrahi  ] given his terminal cancer and deteriorating medical condition . 
Department requests that the following demarche be conveyed to Foreign Minister [PER Musa Kusa  ] following the announcement of a decision by the [MISC Scottish  ] authorities to release [PER Pan Am  ] 103 bomber [PER Abdel Basset Ali  ] [PER Mohamed Al-Megrahi  ] from prison in [LOC Scotland  ] and permit his return to [LOC Libya  ] . 
The suggested message should be delivered immediately following any such announcement . 
OBJECTIVES ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S/REL  ] [LOC LIBYA  ] ) Department instructs Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] to draw upon the following points: -- The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Libya  ] have made remarkable strides in the bilateral relationship since 2003 . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] values its relationship with [LOC Libya  ] and is committed to strengthening our bilateral cooperation . 
-- In light of [MISC Scottish  ] Justice Minister [PER MacAskill  ] , s announcement to grant [PER Megrahi  ] , s application for compassionate release , we strongly urge your government and the [MISC Libyan  ] people to show appropriate restraint . 
-- As you know , the [LOC U.S.  ] position has always been that [PER Megrahi  ] should serve out his sentence in [LOC Scotland  ] . 
[PER Megrahi  ] , s release from a [MISC Scottish  ] prison is a very sensitive issue for the [MISC American  ] public and we encourage you to handle the release in a way that will strengthen the growing relationship between our two countries , rather than hinder its progress . 
-- [PER Megrahi  ] 's return to [LOC Libya  ] will elicit a strong negative reaction among the [MISC American  ] people . 
A " hero 's welcome " for [PER Megrahi  ] , or any other effort to highlight his return , would be viewed extremely negatively by the [LOC White House  ] , especially given the number of [MISC American  ] victims and families whose lives were destroyed by his actions . 
-- Any action by your government to publicly pardon [PER Megrahi  ] for the crimes for which he was convicted will only heighten the negative reaction of the [MISC American  ] people and have a lasting effect on our bilateral relationship . 
( If [PER Megrahi  ] returns to [LOC Libya  ] ) we ask that you enforce the terms of [PER Megrahi  ] , s life sentence by ensuring he remain in prison or under house arrest . 
-- [PER Megrahi  ] , s release from prison is also sensitive given the upcoming participation of [MISC Libyan  ] Leader [PER Qadhafi  ] in the [ORG United Nations General Assembly  ] , which represents his first visit to the [LOC United States  ] and an opportunity to set a positive tone for the relationship following the resolution of outstanding issues . 
-- The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Libya  ] share areas of strong mutual interest and we believe that restraint by the [MISC Libyan  ] government and people upon [PER Megrahi  ] 's return will allow our two countries to focus on the future of the relationship . 
3.NEA [PER A/S Feltman  ] will reinforce the message of restraint with [MISC Libyan  ] Ambassador [PER Aujali  ] in [LOC Washington  ] immediately following any [MISC Scottish  ] announcement approving the compassionate return of [PER Megrahi  ] to [LOC Libya.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [LOC Tripoli  ] minimize considered .
