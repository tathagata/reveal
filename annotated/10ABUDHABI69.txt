( [ORG SBU  ] ) Admiral [ORG Mullen:  ] we warmly welcome your visit to [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] , and have requested an appointment with [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] Crown Prince and Deputy Supreme Commander of the [ORG UAE Armed Forces Shaykh  ] Mohammed bin [PER Zayed Al Nahyan  ] ( [ORG MbZ  ] ) , whom you last met on 9 September 2009 in [LOC Washington  ] . 
We have also requested a meeting with your counterpart , Lieutenant General [PER Hamad al-Thani al-Romaithi  ] , Chief of Staff of the [ORG UAE Armed Forces  ] , whom you last met on 8 October 2009 in [LOC Washington.  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- The Relationship --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [LOC UAE  ] is one of our closest partners in the [LOC Middle East  ] and one of our most useful friends worldwide . 
-- [ORG Al-Dhafra Air Force Base  ] is the high altitude ISR hub for the [ORG AOR  ] , and supports 50 percent of aerial refueling in the [ORG AOR  ] . 
-- Ports in [LOC Dubai  ] and [LOC Fujairah  ] are the logistics backbone for the [ORG U.S. Fifth  ] . 
[LOC Jebel Ali  ] ( [LOC Dubai  ] ) is the most frequented USN liberty port after [LOC Norfolk  ] . 
-- [ORG Minhad Air Base  ] is a critical hub for [MISC Coalition/ISAF  ] partners in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , including the [MISC Australians  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] , [MISC Canadians  ] , [MISC Brits  ] and [MISC Kiwis  ] . 
-- The [LOC UAE  ] is a cash customer with FMS sales in excess of $11 billion . 
Commercial sales have an equivalent value . 
An additional $12 billion of FMS cases are in development with approximately the same volume of commercial sales in the works . 
-- The [LOC UAE  ] recently purchased nine [MISC Patriot  ] batteries , and expects to move forward on the purchase of [LOC THAAD  ] as the first non [LOC US  ] customer . 
-- The [LOC UAE  ] currently commands [MISC CJTF-152  ] ( [LOC Arabian Gulf  ] ) and maintains an active exercise schedule with [LOC U.S  ] . 
( [ORG Red Flag  ] ) and other multi-lateral partners . 
-- The [LOC UAE  ] recently hosted an AFCENT survey team to consider [LOC U.S.  ] access to [ORG Liwa  ] ( [ORG Safran  ] ) [ORG Air Base  ] in support of contingency operations . 
-- Additionally , the [LOC UAE  ] is considering hosting the [ORG Regional Integrated Air  ] and [ORG Missile Defense Center of Excellence.  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- [LOC Iran  ] - the Primordial Concern --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [LOC UAE  ] leadership sees [LOC Iran  ] as its primary external threat , and one that is existential in nature . 
Like much of the international community , the [LOC UAE  ] finds the idea of an [LOC Iran  ] with nuclear weapons unacceptable and thinks this eventuality would lead to a nuclear arms race in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
At least as worrying to [ORG MbZ  ] are [LOC Iran  ] 's aspirations for regional hegemony by support for terrorist proxies ( [ORG Hizballah  ] , [ORG HAMAS  ] , possibly underground organizations in the [LOC Arab Gulf  ] countries ) . 
[ORG MbZ  ] is skeptical that [LOC Iran  ] can be convinced to end its nuclear weapons program , and is not convinced that the international community will adopt tough sanctions . 
In other words , he sees the logic of war dominating the region , and this thinking explains his near obsessive efforts to build up the [LOC UAE  ] 's armed forces. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [ORG MbZ  ] 's main message to us during his September visit was that we needed to be better coordinated for [LOC Iran  ] contingencies . 
High level engagement by [ORG CENTCOM  ] planners have helped to address this concern , but he believes we have made less progress in addressing what he sees as the slow pace of deliveries of [LOC US  ] security assistance and he is still worried that he does not have enough equipment in place to defend his people when war with [LOC Iran  ] breaks out . 
( And for [ORG MbZ  ] it is a matter of when , not if . 
) We have repeatedly presented to his staff the various explanations for what he perceives as delays , but he remains unconvinced that we are addressing his concerns as a matter of priority. --------------------------------------------- ----- [LOC Afghanistan  ] - [ORG Pakistan:  ] A [ORG Solid Partner  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) Afghanistan: [LOC UAE  ] SOF has been quietly deployed as part of [ORG OEF  ] since 2003 , and the [LOC UAE  ] surged its contribution in 2009 adding a combined arms task force . 
The [LOC UAE  ] 's UAV capability has been a much appreciated force multiplier . 
On the economic development side , the [LOC UAE  ] has pledged about $300 M in assistance , and quietly supported the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Reintegration Fund  ] at the recent [ORG London Conference  ] . 
You should thank [ORG MbZ  ] for his leadership in being the first [MISC Arab  ] country to send troops to [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG Pakistan:  ] the [LOC UAE  ] has taken a leading role in the Friends of [LOC Pakistan  ] initiative and has provided about $800 M in assistance in recent years . 
The [ORG Al Nahyan  ] family had a long-standing relationship with former Prime Minister [PER Benazir Bhutto  ] , and this has transitioned to support for her husband , [PER Asif Ali Zardari  ] , but the [LOC UAE  ] stays in touch with all elements on the [MISC Pakistani  ] scene , including [PER Musharraf  ] . 
[ORG MbZ  ] will be very interested in your dialogue with General [PER Kayani.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) Threat finance: we have a cooperative relationship with the [LOC UAE  ] at the Federal level on addressing [MISC Taliban  ] financing . 
As our information has begun to flow , we have seen increasing activity and interest on the part of [LOC UAE  ] authorities . 
That said , the subject is delicate and operational aspects are best handled through our well established Treasury/Intelligence channel. --------------------------------------------- ----- [MISC Yemen: Increasing  ] Concern --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [ORG MbZ  ] shares our concern about [LOC Yemen  ] , and if anything , is more alarmed about the possibility for destabilization of [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
He is convinced that the [MISC Iranians  ] are involved in [LOC Yemen  ] , and supporting the [MISC Houthi  ] rebels . 
When we tell him that we have no evidence of [MISC Iranian  ] support , he is somewhat incredulous , suggesting that our focus on [ORG Al Qaeda  ] has caused us to lose sight of the bigger picture of [MISC Iranian  ] adventurism . 
You should encourage him to provide any specific information on [MISC Iranian  ] activities to us through intelligence channels. --------------------------------------------- ----- Iraq: the Bellwether for [LOC Iran  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) Iraq: the [LOC UAE  ] was the first [ORG GCC Country  ] to cancel [LOC Saddam  ] era debt and re-establish an embassy , and has generally followed a policy of constructive engagement with the [ORG Maliki Government  ] . 
But [ORG MbZ  ] runs hot and cold on [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Sometimes he chooses to emphasize his supportive position ; at other times he suggests that [LOC Iran  ] has been the big winner in [LOC Iraq  ] , and that [ORG Southern Iraq  ] will be one of the major flashpoints in the upcoming confrontation with [LOC Iran  ] . 
Anything you can say to reassure him about the [LOC US  ] commitment to [MISC Iraqi  ] stability will be helpful .
