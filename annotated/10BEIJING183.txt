Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Secretary [PER Clinton  ] 's January 21 speech on [ORG Internet Freedom  ] touched a nerve in [LOC China  ] . 
Official reaction was negative , with harsh criticism coming from the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] in an official statement and from other parts of the [MISC Chinese  ] system through critical articles and editorials in the official press . 
[MISC Chinese  ] [MISC Internet  ] censors were deployed in force to block online commentary and coverage of the Secretary 's speech , and as of January 24 , sites in the [LOC United States  ] that carried transcripts of the speech were inaccessible without VPN or other firewall-evading software . 
The few [MISC Chinese  ] netizens and bloggers who did manage to access the speech and then dared write about it were generally supportive of the Secretary 's message . 
Other Embassy contacts , including academic USA-watchers and journalists , lamented that the Secretary 's speech would strengthen and embolden those in the [MISC Chinese  ] system who advocated greater control over the [MISC Internet  ] in [LOC China  ] . 
They expressed concern that [MISC Internet  ] freedom would be made into an " us vs. them " issue rather than a " right vs. wrong " issue . 
Contacts warned that [MISC Chinese  ] officials see [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to promote [MISC Internet  ] freedom as an attack , repeatedly invoking the specter of " color revolution . 
" Some contacts in the tech industry praised the speech as being " spot on " in its coverage of [LOC U.S.  ] firms' difficulty with the [MISC Chinese  ] business environment . 
Contacts outside [LOC Beijing  ] were cautious with their comments . 
Embassy and consulate officers will continue to follow the reaction to the Secretary 's remarks in the weeks ahead to assess their continuing impact on government , think tank , media , blogger and business actions with regard to the [MISC Internet  ] . 
End Summary . 
Official Reaction Negative -------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a January 22 statement in reaction to the Secretary 's [MISC Internet  ] freedom speech , [MISC Chinese  ] [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] spokesperson [PER Ma Zhaoxu  ] , said " we firmly oppose such words and deeds , which are against the facts and harmful to [MISC U.S.-China  ] relations . 
" [PER Ma  ] 's remarks followed a January 21 press conference by Vice Foreign Minister He [PER Yafei  ] 's in which he did not refer to the Secretary 's speech , but urged the [LOC United States  ] to refrain from " over-interpreting " the [ORG Google  ] case , saying it should not be allowed to impact bilateral relations . 
[PER Ma  ] 's statement was much more negative than initial unofficial comment from working-level [ORG MFA  ] officers the morning of January 22 . 
Asked about the speech , [ORG MFA  ] North [MISC American  ] and [ORG Oceanian Affairs Department U.S.A. Division  ] Director [PER An Gang  ] told poloff that the [ORG MFA  ] noticed that specific [MISC Chinese  ] cases or individuals were not mentioned in the speech , and that " we are very happy about that . 
" ( Comment: the contrast between the " softer " comments from the [LOC USA  ] desk and the harder language from the Spokesman several hours later suggests that the negative reaction to the speech originated at higher levels in the foreign policy hierarchy . 
) Media Reaction Dutifully Echoes [ORG MFA  ] Criticism --------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Chinese  ] media coverage of the Secretary 's speech widely quoted the [ORG MFA  ] statement . 
January 22 coverage included assertions that the Secretary 's call for unrestricted access to the [MISC Internet  ] could be regarded " as a disguised attempt to impose [LOC U.S.  ] values in the name of democracy . 
" Articles in the nationalist daily [ORG Global Times  ] stated that the bulk of [MISC Internet  ] comment originated in the [LOC West  ] , " loaded with aggressive rhetoric against other countries , " against which other countries cannot hope to defend . 
[ORG Beijing University  ] Professor of Communications [PER Hu Yong  ] , quoted in the 21st [ORG Century Business Herald  ] , said the Secretary 's discussion of sharing technology to allow users to circumvent [MISC Internet  ] censorship meant that the " [ORG Google  ] incident is only the beginning of a rolling snowball . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Most regional reporting in [LOC China  ] emphasized that [MISC Internet  ] freedom has now become embedded as a new diplomatic tool the [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy . 
[LOC Shanghai  ] 's influential [ORG Wenhui Daily  ] ran a January 23 commentary calling Secretary [PER Clinton  ] 's remarks " arrogant , illogical , and full of political shows and calculations , " accusing her of having a " [MISC Cold War  ] mentality . 
" Some [MISC Chinese  ] outlets rebutted [LOC U.S.  ] charges by praising [MISC Chinese  ] [MISC Internet  ] practices . 
January 22 televised news programming reported on the benefits for [MISC Chinese  ] users of [MISC Chinese  ] governmental supervision of the [MISC Internet  ] . 
[LOC Shanghai  ] TV January 22 broadcast programming which painted [MISC Chinese  ] online police in a positive light . 
[LOC BEIJING  ] 00000183 002 OF 005 Blogger Community: Those that Saw it , Liked it --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Chinese  ] netizens accessed the Secretary 's speech and shared reactions through rough real-time translations on Twitter , blogs , and [ORG Google  ] . 
The range of opinions among the self-selecting demographic of [MISC Chinese  ] netizens , who had circumvented [MISC Chinese  ] government blocks to blog and participate in [MISC Twitter-based  ] discussions , ranged from supportive to skeptical , with the majority expressing agreement with the principles outlined in the Secretary 's speech . 
In general , [MISC Chinese  ] netizen comments focused on speculation about linkages between the Secretary 's speech and [ORG Google  ] 's announcement that it was considering withdrawing from [LOC China.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Many netizen reactions echoed the statements by [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] who tweeted that Secretary [PER Clinton  ] 's speech " clarified the relation between [MISC Internet  ] freedom and business prosperity , which gave better guidance for [MISC American  ] companies operating in [LOC China  ] . 
" A [MISC Chinese  ] blogger named [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] wrote that the speech was " certain to have a positive effect and was welcomed by [MISC Chinese  ] [MISC Internet  ] users regarding the censorship problem in [LOC China  ] . 
" Others ommented that the speech was an indication that the [LOC United States  ] was leading the [MISC U.S.-China  ] relationship in the right direction. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Some [MISC Chinese  ] bloggers viewed the Secretary 's speech as " confrontational , " but nonetheless inspiring to the [MISC Chinese  ] people. - [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , depicted Secretary [PER Clinton  ] as [PER Joan of Arc  ] , with a widely distributed graphic of " [PER Hillary  ] leads the people . 
" Another [MISC Chinese  ] Twitter user wrote , " What a historic speech it is the launching of an [MISC Internet  ] war , the confrontation between democracy and authoritarianism becoming public , and the beginning of a new [MISC Cold War  ] . 
" - [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , a blogger based in [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , similarly characterized the speech as " a declaration of war fro a free nation to an autocracy . 
It might be as important as [ORG Churchill  ] 's [ORG Iron Curtain Speech..  ] . 
I will wait with hope . 
The direct mention of [LOC China  ] also calls for a frank and honest discussion between [PER Hu Jintao  ] and [PER Wen Jiabao  ] . 
" -XXXXXXXXXXXX , attending a [ORG Mission  ] sponsored event in [LOC Beijing  ] ( see para 21 ) , said the Secretary 's speech " showed the power of the [MISC Internet  ] to the world " and raised the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Internet  ] strategy to a new level. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Some bloggers expressed skepticism. - [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] tweeted , " the [LOC U.S.  ] government has been talking about supporting world-wide [MISC Internet  ] freedom for ages , but it hasn't done much yet . 
" - [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , doubted the sincerity of the [MISC United States'  ] commitment to the freedoms mentioned in Secretary [PER Clinton  ] 's speech due to competing commercial and national security interests . 
[MISC Chinese  ] bloggers , regardless of their outlook , have widely reported that [MISC Chinese  ] web monitors have been aggressively deleting posts and content related to the Secretary 's speech . 
[LOC China  ] Watchers: Speech Will Provoke the Authorities --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Other contacts analyzed the Secretary 's speech the way bloggers did , but were pessimistic about the effect of the speech on [MISC Chinese  ] authorities . 
On January 22 [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told poloff that following the controversy generated by [ORG Google  ] 's announcement , the issue of [MISC Internet  ] freedom had been discussed several times within the [ORG Politburo Standing Committee  ] which had agreed that the issue of [MISC Internet  ] freedom had supplanted traditional human rights issues as a new " battleground " between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC China  ] . 
Although he was not aware of any specific [ORG Standing Committee  ] decisions , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that President [PER Hu Jintao  ] had provided general guidance that the issue should not be allowed to cause major disruptions to [MISC U.S.-China  ] relations. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) On January 21 , speaking before the Secretary 's speech , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , told poloff that the [ORG Communist Party  ] viewed [MISC Internet  ] freedom initiatives as a direct challenge to its ability to maintain social and political stability and , therefore , its legitimacy . 
He said that , in this context , the [ORG Party  ] would resist international pressure on the [ORG Google  ] issue and would increase restrictions on the [MISC Internet  ] in the period leading up to the [ORG 18th Party Congress  ] in 2012 . 
He predicted that the Secretary 's speech [LOC BEIJING  ] 00000183 003 OF 005 would be viewed as directed at the [ORG Communist Party  ] and would therefore generate uncertainty about [LOC U.S.  ] intentions towards [LOC China.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) On January 23 , a prominent [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX University  ] media and public opinion researcher pointed out that most [MISC Chinese  ] media reactions to the Secretary 's speech had simply republished the [ORG MFA  ] statement and were not printing any quotations from the speech itself . 
Given the political sensitivity of the speech and the [ORG Google  ] case , this was the only safe thing to do , he said . 
Any perceived support for the Secretary 's speech in the press would " cross a red line " with censors . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the [MISC Chinese  ] public had mixed feelings about the speech and the [ORG Google  ] issue . 
While many in [LOC China  ] were dissatisfied with [MISC Internet  ] censorship , they also resented public criticism from [LOC U.S.  ] officials , he said , predicting that the speech would increase nationalist sentiment in [LOC China  ] . 
Another contact , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] agreed that while it might cause a nationalist response , the Secretary 's message " needed to be said . 
" He predicted that the [MISC Chinese  ] government would attempt to appeal to nationalism to counter the Secretary 's speech . 
However , he noted that most current media commentary critical of the speech , and [ORG Google  ] , was not being written by well known journalists , intellectuals or scholars whose silence could be read as a show of support for the speech - and for [ORG Google.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , told poloff January 23 that he had been " disappointed and depressed " when he read the Secretary 's speech . 
" Those who tried to control the [MISC Internet  ] more in [LOC China  ] never had much support before , " he said . 
" Most people believe information should be open , and the [MISC Internet  ] should be open . 
The conservative , security people were the minority and many people just laughed at them . 
" The Secretary 's speech , however , gave great new energy to the " controllers " who could now plausibly argue that the [LOC United States  ] was explicitly using the [MISC Internet  ] as a tool for regime change . 
" The [MISC Internet  ] belongs to every country , " he complained ; " we all can go there , we all can add to it , we all can learn from it . 
We [MISC Chinese  ] were free there . 
Now the [LOC United States  ] has claimed it for itself and so it will become an ideological battlefield . 
" He asserted that , in the past , the [MISC Chinese  ] authorities had paid relatively little attention to controlling the [MISC Internet  ] , focusing only on the issues that were the most urgent and letting most netizens alone . 
" That is finished now . 
The Secretary 's 'information curtain' remark will give the authorities what they need to 'harmonize' the [MISC Internet  ] for all [MISC Chinese  ] citizens . 
" ( Comment: 'harmonize' is an acidly sarcastic term in [MISC Chinese  ] to describe official deletion or blockage of [MISC Internet  ] content . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is nearly always laid back and even-tempered . 
His commentary on this issue was more emotional and bitter than poloff has seen from him in dozens of encounters over three years , even on extremely sensitive issues such as XXXXXXXXXXXX. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] warned that [ORG Google  ] 's announcement had become a new irritant to the bilateral relationship with the potential to be even more dangerous than the [LOC Taiwan  ] and [LOC Tibet  ] issue . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that many [MISC Chinese  ] citizens believed that [ORG Google  ] 's decision was part of a coordinated public/private effort by the [ORG USG  ] to impose [LOC U.S.  ] values on [LOC China  ] , what he referred to as an " E-color revolution . 
" As confirmation of this theory , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] cited Secretary [PER Clinton  ] 's January 7 " 21st Century Statecraft " dinner with several tech sector [MISC CEOs  ] ( including [ORG Google  ] ) , [ORG Google  ] 's donations to President [PER Obama  ] 's presidential campaign , and Secretary [PER Clinton  ] 's January 21 speech on [MISC Internet  ] freedom. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] warned that there were people in [LOC China  ] and other countries such as [LOC Iran  ] who might see the " shadow of color revolution " in recent [ORG USG  ] policies promoting [MISC Internet  ] freedom and 21st century e-diplomacy . 
For example , [MISC Iranians  ] might perceive [LOC Washington  ] 's new initiatives on [MISC Internet  ] freedom or the advocacy of new technologies such as Twitter to be " aggressive " or harboring ulterior motives , such as promoting regime change , said [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] Informed [MISC Chinese  ] netizens already know how to circumvent the [ORG Great Firewall  ] to access [ORG Facebook  ] and [PER Twitter  ] , [PER Guo  ] said , including by using commercially available software . 
He feared , however , tha if the [ORG USG  ] provided free software that helped [MISC Chinese  ] netizens overcome filters , this might politicize the issue of [MISC Internet  ] freedom and force the [ORG PRC  ] government to react . 
One possible [LOC BEIJING  ] 00000183 004 OF 005 consequence , warned [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , was that [LOC China  ] might make it illegal to download either U.S.-provided or commercially available software that helped [MISC Internet  ] surfers circumvent the [ORG Great Firewall.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Professor [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said January 22 that restricting the [MISC Internet  ] access of [MISC Chinese  ] netizens would theoretically hamper development of cutting edge industries , but was skeptical this had happened in reality . 
Professor [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , said in the same meeting that the problem was that [LOC China  ] 's leaders did not yet feel comfortable with thes new communications technologies and thus preferred to proceed cautiously . 
The [ORG Google  ] issue and Secretary [PER Clinton  ] 's speech were likely to prompt them to shift from a low-profile to a higher-profile response on [MISC Internet  ] freedom . 
IT Industry: Speech Accurately Portrayed Business Environment --------------------------------------------- ---------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) The president of [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , called the Secretary 's speech " spot on , " directly capturing industry concerns about a business climate that is getting worse on a " day-to-day basis . 
" He applauded the Secretary 's speech as a means of bringing the [MISC Chinese  ] to the table to address key concerns about the business environment and said the decision taken by [ORG Google  ] was of enormous magnitude , indicating the depth of concern over issues it is facing here . 
As a result , he believes , the [MISC Chinese  ] government 's failure to respond to its people 's opposition to censorship would embolden the netizen community in its efforts to evade government controls. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Another high-tech industry consultant expressed concern that the Secretary 's speech would dampen the [MISC U.S.-China  ] business climate and drive it " to a new low . 
" The consultant observed that " [LOC China  ] has noticed that the [ORG NSA  ] and the [ORG Pentagon  ] have dominated cyberspace policy for over a year . 
" Key officials , academics , and military leaders , according to this consultant , hold paranoid fears that the [LOC U.S.  ] would one day launch a " zero-day " attack on all of [LOC China  ] 's critical infrastructure . 
The Secretary 's speech and [ORG Google  ] 's recent actions , would amplify this belief. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) Reaction in northern [LOC China  ] , where [ORG Intel  ] has a multi-billion dollar manufacturing factory investment under construction , however , has thus far been limited [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that the Secretary 's speech had thus far not created a stir . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had in the past several days met with several [LOC Dalian  ] Vice Mayors , and reported [ORG Google  ] and [MISC Internet  ] freedom issues had not been raised. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [MISC South China-based  ] [MISC Internet  ] portal contacts were reluctant to talk with [ORG ConGenoffs  ] about ongoing media coverage of [ORG Google  ] or broader internet freedom issues . 
A public relations manager from [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] initially refused to comment , saying it was not appropriate for her to offer an opinion on policy matters , but then guardedly reverted to official-sounding comments about why [MISC Internet  ] regulation is important for the well-being of [MISC Chinese  ] users and the maintenance of a positive online environment. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) A working-level official from the [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] went further in sharing pro-government comments with ConGenoff , saying that [ORG Google  ] is a business and should restrict itself To business matters , rather than venturing into political territory . 
The official said 2009 was a very strong year for internet companies in [LOC China  ] and that internet restrictions had not dampened individual user 's online experiences or companies' earnings . 
Mission Outreach on the Secretary 's Speech ------------------------------------------ <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) January 22 , [ORG Embassy Beijing  ] and [ORG Consulates General Shanghai  ] , [LOC Guangzhou  ] and [LOC Shenyang  ] hosted a simultaneous digital video conference viewing of the Secretary 's speech for dozens of local bloggers , with an additional 300 netizens attending via the [MISC Internet  ] . 
Mission estimates indicate [PER Twitter  ] communications and blog entries will reach a combined audience of millions of persons . 
Following the speech , participating bloggers , who were generally supportive of the Secretary 's message , engaged in a lively discussion focused on what specific measures the [LOC United States  ] government could take to promote [MISC Internet  ] freedom in [LOC China  ] and whether the speech constituted a new direction for [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy on [LOC BEIJING  ] 00000183 005 OF 005 [LOC China  ] .
