END SUMMARY . 
SURPRISE GUEST AT [PER MIQDAD  ] MEETING <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) GID Director General [PER Ali Mamlouk  ] was the surprise guest at a February 18 meeting at the [ORG MFA  ] hosted by Vice Foreign Minister [PER Faisal al-Miqdad  ] with S/CT Coordinator [PER Daniel Benjamin  ] , [ORG DHS A/S  ] [PER David Heyman  ] , and [ORG NEA  ] DAS [PER Maura Connelly  ] . 
[PER Miqdad  ] said Mamlouk’s participation in the meeting had come at the direction of President [PER Asad  ] following what [PER Miqdad  ] termed a positive meeting between [PER Asad  ] and [PER U/S Burns  ] on February 17 . 
[MISC Syrian  ] Ambassador to the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Imad Mustapha  ] , who translated for [PER Mamlouk  ] during the meeting , stated that Mamlouk’s attendance at meetings with foreign delegations was extraordinary and did not occur “even with friendly countries like [LOC Britain  ] and [PER France.” Mustapha  ] explained President [PER Asad  ] instructed [PER Mamlouk  ] to attend the meeting as a personal gesture. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Benjamin  ] , stressing that cooperation on counter-terrorism efforts was an essential part of the roadmap for improved bilateral relations , noted that there were issues on which we had clear differences , such as [MISC Syrian  ] support for [ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] , he continued , still viewed these groups as undermining stability and the prospects for peace in the region . 
Nonetheless , the two countries should still work to cooperate on immediate threats facing both the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Syria  ] , including the proliferation of takfiri groups in the region , such as al-Qaeda , and stopping the flow of foreign fighters into [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The Coordinator provided [PER Mamlouk  ] an overview of the threats posed by terrorist groups operating in the region from [LOC North Africa  ] to [LOC Iraq  ] to [LOC Yemen  ] . 
[PER Benjamin  ] noted the challenge that these groups posed to [LOC Syria  ] as well , illustrated by the September 2008 attack on a [MISC Syrian  ] intelligence building . 
He explained the [LOC U.S.  ] is concerned about the long-term implications of arms smuggling to [LOC Lebanon  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] through [LOC Syria  ] , and observed that the disarray among the [MISC Palestinians  ] could ultimately create an opening for groups with an al-Qaeda orientation , citing the case of [LOC Junjalat  ] , a radical faction in [LOC Gaza.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Mamlouk  ] pointed to [ORG Syria’s  ] 30 years of experience in battling radical groups such as the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] as evidence of [ORG Syria’s  ] commitment to the fight against terrorism . 
[PER Mamlouk  ] termed [MISC Benjamin’s  ] description of the challenges posed by terrorist groups in the region as “valid , despite the reasons that gave rise to them.” [PER Mamlouk  ] repeatedly stressed his attendance at the meeting did not signal the commencement of security and intelligence cooperation between [LOC Syria  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] , but could be a starting point for “a blueprint for that which is not yet started.” Echoing [PER Miqdad  ] , [PER Mamlouk  ] said progress on political issues in the [MISC Syrian-U.S.  ] bilateral relationship was “closely connected” to progress on possible cooperation on security and intelligence . 
[PER MAMLOUK  ] DESCRIBES GID’S METHODS <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The GID Director said [LOC Syria  ] had been more successful than the [LOC U.S.  ] and other countries in the region in fighting terrorist groups because “we are practical and not theoretical.” He stated [ORG Syria’s  ] success is due to its penetration of terrorist groups. “In principle , we don’t attack or kill them immediately . 
Instead , we embed ourselves in them and only at the opportune moment do we move.” Describing the process of planting embeds in terrorist organizations as “complex , ” [PER Mamlouk  ] said the result had yielded been the detention of scores of terrorists , stamping out terror cells , and stopping hundreds of terrorists from entering [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Mamlouk  ] acknowledged some terrorists were still slipping into [LOC Iraq  ] from [LOC Syria.  ] “By all means we will continue to do all this , but if we start cooperation with you it will lead to better results and we can better protect our interests , ” he concluded. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) According to [PER Mamlouk  ] , [ORG Syria’s  ] previous experience in cooperating with the [LOC U.S.  ] on intelligence “was not a happy one.” He stated [LOC Syria  ] hoped any future cooperation would be “on an equal basis.” [PER Mamlouk  ] specified this meant [LOC Syria  ] should be allowed to “take the lead” on anti-terrorism efforts . 
Alluding to the “wealth of information” [LOC Syria  ] has obtained while penetrating terrorist groups , [PER Mamlouk  ] declared “we have a lot of experience and know these groups . 
This is our area , and we know it . 
We are on the ground , and so we should take the lead.” POSSIBLE COOPERATION ON [LOC IRAQ  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Mamlouk  ] identified [MISC Iraqi  ] border security as an area where [LOC Syria  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] could cooperate . 
He described [LOC Syria  ] as ready to move forward on tripartite border security talks , but added “we are at a freezing point until after the [MISC Iraqi  ] elections” scheduled for March . 
[PER Mamlouk  ] added that cooperation on [MISC Iraqi  ] border security could lead to cooperation in other areas. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Benjamin  ] , noting the importance of achieving a secure and stable [LOC Iraq  ] , stated an important measure of progress on this subject is further success on reducing the flow of foreign fighters and cracking down on their facilitators . 
[PER Mamlouk  ] said the foreign fighters come from a large number of [MISC Arab  ] and [MISC Muslim  ] countries and that the [MISC Syrians  ] detain “large numbers plus their local facilitators.” As an example , [PER Mamlouk  ] said he handed over 23 [MISC Saudis  ] detained in [LOC Syria  ] to [MISC Saudi  ] Prince Muqrin last year . 
[PER Benjamin  ] commended [PER Mamlouk  ] on reducing the flow of foreign fighters , while encouraging further progress . 
[PER Miqdad  ] interjected that the issue of foreign fighters using [MISC Syrian  ] soil is a matter of national security for [LOC Syria.  ] “We have zero tolerance , ” he said . 
[PER Miqdad  ] said [LOC Syria  ] needs the cooperation of other countries , namely those from which the terrorists are coming. “If we can close this circle - with us , you , and other countries - we will succeed , ” he concluded. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Miqdad  ] added that [MISC Syrian/Lebanese  ] border security is also a subject on which the [MISC SARG  ] is making progress . 
Stating “the past is behind us , ” [PER Miqdad  ] said [LOC Syria  ] is attempting to assist the [MISC Lebanese  ] on security at ports and at the border without interfering in internal [MISC Lebanese  ] affairs . 
UPDATE ON TERRORIST NAMES PROVIDED BY [ORG USG  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Alluding to previous [ORG USG  ] requests for assistance on tracking down terrorists thought to be in [LOC Syria  ] , the [MISC Syrian  ] side stressed that intelligence cooperation between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Syria  ] should not be solely based on receiving names of terrorist suspects from the [ORG USG  ] and checking up on those individuals . 
However , [PER Mamlouk  ] confirmed that [LOC Syria  ] could verify the specific whereabouts of several individuals who had been discussed in previous meetings with [MISC SARG  ] officials . 
[PER MIQDAD  ] WANTS POLITICAL UMBRELLA TO GUIDE SECURITY COOPERATION <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Following Mamlouk’s statements regarding possible security and intelligence cooperation , [PER Miqdad  ] stated he wanted to emphasize three points . 
First , [PER Miqdad  ] said that because of [ORG Syria’s  ] “wealth of information” on following 30 years of facing security threats from takfiri groups , [LOC Syria  ] must be able to take the lead in any joint efforts . 
Second , the Vice Foreign Minister said politics are an integral part of combating terrorism and warned that listing [LOC Syria  ] as a state sponsor of terrorism and including [LOC Syria  ] on the list of 14 countries for enhanced screening by the [ORG Transportation Security Administration  ] ( [ORG TSA  ] ) created a “contradiction” when the [LOC U.S.  ] subsequently requested cooperation with [LOC Syria  ] against terrorism . 
[PER Miqdad  ] stressed a “political umbrella” of improved [MISC U.S.-Syrian  ] bilateral relations should facilitate counterterrorism cooperation. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Third , [PER Miqdad  ] stated convincing the [MISC Syrian  ] people to support cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] would hinge on progress on economic sanctions against [LOC Syria  ] , including spare parts for airplanes and a plane for President [PER Asad  ] . 
The Vice Foreign Minister said the [MISC Syrians  ] wanted these efforts “accelerated.” [PER Miqdad  ] specifically requested the [ORG USG  ] reach out to [ORG Lufthansa Technik  ] and “assure them of no negative consequences” if they cooperate with [MISC Syrian  ] requests to have the purchase of spare aircraft parts approved . 
In response , [PER Benjamin  ] said the [MISC Obama  ] administration viewed counterterrorism as a vital concern but , unlike its predecessor , it did not see counterterrorism as something that was separate from the rest of [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy or the sole driver of [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy . 
Rather , it was part of the fabric of policy , and the administration recognized that progress in bilateral relations would involve coordinated moves in a number of areas . 
[PER Benjamin  ] added the [LOC U.S.  ] expected that the [MISC Syrian  ] people would see the benefits of closer relations. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Miqdad  ] also encouraged the [LOC U.S.  ] to reconsider including [LOC Syria  ] on the [MISC TSA’s  ] list for enhanced screening , and praised [PER U/S Burns  ] for informing the [MISC SARG  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] was prepared to lift its block on [MISC Syrian  ] accession to the [MISC World Trade Organization.  ] “In summary , President [PER Asad  ] wants cooperation , we should take the lead on that cooperation , and don’t put us on your lists , ” [PER Miqdad  ] declared . 
DHS BRIEFING <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Benjamin  ] and [PER Heyman  ] underscored that the [MISC TSA’s  ] enhanced screening requirements protected travelers of all nationalities , and that the [ORG TSA  ] does not target [MISC Syrians  ] but applies to all travelers , including [MISC American  ] citizens , coming to the [LOC U.S.  ] from or through the listed countries. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER A/S Heyman  ] provided the [MISC Syrians  ] with a brief overview of DHS’s mission and activities , focusing in particular on its expertise in the management of ports , airports , and land borders . 
He noted DHS could explore with the [MISC SARG  ] ways to meet international security standards at ports . 
This , in turn , could lead to enhanced trade and travel between the two countries , and reduce obstacles to shipping between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Syria  ] . 
[PER Heyman  ] said the [ORG Coast Guard  ] was prepared to send a team to [LOC Syria  ] to work on port security with their [MISC Syrian  ] counterparts . 
This type of activity could lead to measures that reduced costs and lowered barriers to shipping . 
General [PER Mamlouk  ] said the [MISC SARG  ] would study the proposed [ORG Coast Guard  ] visit . 
UPCOMING VISITS <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Highlighting the importance of continued [MISC U.S.-Syrian  ] dialogue on bilateral issues , [PER Benjamin  ] proposed a mid-March visit to [LOC Damascus  ] by [ORG NEA A/S  ] [PER Feltman  ] and [ORG NSC Senior  ] Director for the [LOC Middle East  ] and [LOC North Africa  ] [PER Daniel Shapiro  ] . 
[PER Benjamin  ] invited [PER Miqdad  ] to a subsequent visit to [LOC Washington  ] in April . 
[PER Miqdad  ] spoke at length about his fondness for [PER A/S Feltman  ] , and thanked [PER Benjamin  ] for the invitation to visit [LOC Washington  ] . 
[PER Benjamin  ] added he was ready to return to [LOC Damascus  ] at the appropriate time . 
[PER Mamlouk  ] asked [PER Benjamin  ] what the agenda of his next visit would be , and [PER Benjamin  ] explained that it would depend on the outcome of the upcoming visits. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 .
