( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] The [MISC US-India  ] counterterrorism dialogue reflects our shared values and encompasses the range of [LOC CT  ] issues in [LOC South Asia  ] . 
[LOC New Delhi  ] focuses on combating jihadi terrorism launched from [LOC Pakistan  ] , which complicates [MISC USG  ] efforts to engage [ORG Delhi  ] in a more vibrant intelligence dialogue without compromising relations with [LOC Islamabad  ] . 
The [ORG GOI  ] is less concerned with discussing [PER Naxalite  ] ( Maoist agrarian peasant movement ) or ethno-linguistic separatist terrorism in India’s Northeast states . 
The [MISC GOI’s  ] focus also remains on here-and-now terrorism vice more exotic and more potentially devastating variants such as bio-terrorism and [MISC WMD-terrorism  ] . 
The exception here is on cyber-terrorism/cybersecurity , where the growing financial and prestige value of India’s IT sector is helping energize positive interactions . 
India’s large [MISC Muslim  ] population , and that community’s relatively positive relations with its [MISC Hindu  ] majority , also offer insights on how we can more effectively engage in the battle of ideas against violent extremism within a democratic , pluralistic society. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Since the August 2004 CTJWG , the [ORG GOI  ] has moved forward with counterterrorism legislation and policy , including on terrorist finance and hijackings , but we still have gaps in our understanding of how these new procedures will be implemented . 
[LOC India  ] has a vast capacity to absorb [MISC USG  ] counterterrorism training ; although we see [MISC Indian  ] security services replicating the training they receive , our challenge now is to rationalize the training the [MISC USG  ] offers to ensure it meets mutually-agreed goals . 
There is also ample room to expand information and intelligence sharing between the [MISC USG  ] and [ORG GOI  ] , but much will depend on the degree to which [LOC US  ] priorities align with [MISC Indian  ] goals . 
Overcoming the lingering effects of decades of mutual mistrust is also essential . 
[ORG Embassy New Delhi  ] has had some experience with working under the [ORG US-India Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty  ] ( [ORG MLAT  ] ) that came [LOC NEW DELHI  ] 00002587 002 OF 012 into force in October ; there is room here too for improvement . 
Top [ORG GOI  ] officials have publicly expressed their strong interest in [LOC India  ] becoming a member of the [ORG Egmont Group  ] and the [ORG Financial Action Task Force  ] ( [ORG FATF  ] ) . 
This message also includes information on other terrorism-related topics that the [ORG GOI  ] delegation may reference , either in the formal [ORG CTJWG  ] or in side-meetings. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Since the last CTJWG a host of bilateral interactions , including disaster cooperation ( the December 2004 tsunami and the October 2005 earthquake ) , foreign policy alignment ( on [LOC Nepal  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] ) , the [ORG Defense Framework Agreement  ] , the July 18 nuclear agreement , and the [MISC President’s  ] visit capped off by the civil nuclear deal , have brought the two countries much closer together in a variety of venues . 
Our [ORG CT  ] bureaucracies and security services , however , lag behind growing bilateral movement on trade , energy and scientific cooperation , but the background atmospherics are encouraging . 
We now need to foster new thinking in [LOC Delhi  ] and [LOC Washington  ] that will advance our common [ORG CT  ] agendas faster than before possible . 
End Summary . 
[ORG CT Bureaucratics  ] ---------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) The [ORG MEA  ] has the lead on international [ORG CT  ] cooperation , with Additional Secretary ( [ORG International Organizations  ] ) KC Singh the [MISC GOI’s  ] interlocutor ( Ref K ) . 
On-the-ground [ORG CT  ] activity at the national level is the bailiwick of the [ORG Ministry of Home Affairs  ] ( [ORG MHA  ] ) , however . 
In some instances , such as on the 2005 offer of an Itemizer to help secure the [MISC Srinagar-Muzzafarabad  ] bus , we have been quietly told by our [ORG MEA  ] interlocutors that [ORG MHA  ] objections made certain [ORG CT  ] cooperation impossible . 
( NOTE: Our inability to engage [ORG MHA  ] on policy matters leaves us with solely the [MISC MEA’s  ] word on such occasions . 
End Note . 
) The [ORG Intelligence Bureau  ] ( [ORG IB  ] ) and [ORG Research and Analysis Wing  ] ( [ORG RAW  ] ) compete on [ORG CT  ] intelligence issues ; the [ORG Central Bureau of Investigation  ] ( [ORG CBI  ] ) , the FBI-equivalent , is the national-level law enforcement agency . 
Most [ORG CT  ] activities , from security to investigation and prosecution , happen at the state level , however , and the various states and [ORG Union Territories  ] exhibit varying ( typically low ) levels of cooperation amongst each other and with the federal government . 
The [ORG National Security Council Secretariat  ] , which enjoys a wealth of subject-matter experts SIPDIS ( vice the rest of the [MISC Indian  ] bureaucracy , which dramatically shifts portfolios every few years ) , is worth pursuing in areas within their scope , such as cybersecurity ( see [PER Para  ] 20 ) , as well as other areas they ( or [PER NSA Narayanan  ] ) seek to add to their mandate . 
Threat Assessment: Priority on Jihadis -------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Terrorism conducted by jihadi groups based in [LOC Pakistan  ] -- and sometimes with the support of elements of the GOP -- is historically the most lethal and the most politically volatile strain of terrorism in [LOC India  ] . 
Reflecting improved counterinsurgency policies , civilian fatalities from terrorism in [LOC Jammu  ] and [LOC Kashmir  ] have [LOC NEW DELHI  ] 00002587 003 OF 012 substantially decreased from 2001-2004 ( approximately 20% decrease each year ) , according to [MISC Indian  ] government statistics and a leading independent [MISC Indian  ] terrorism expert . 
The data for the first nine months of 2005 showed a continued decline , but a spike in lethal attacks after the October 8 earthquake resulted in the 2005 levels being roughly equal to those for 2004 . 
Since January 2005 , jihadis have carried out or are believed to be responsible for lethal attacks at three popular markets on [MISC Diwali  ] ( Ref N ) and [PER Jamma Masjid  ] ( [ORG Septel  ] ) , both in [LOC Delhi  ] , as well as [LOC Ayodhya  ] ( Ref Q ) , [LOC Varanasi  ] ( Ref F ) , and [ORG Bangalore  ] ( Ref J ) , in addition to the litany of deadly bombings and shootings in [LOC J&K  ] itself . 
These new targets in the [MISC Hindi  ] heartland and the south reflect a new and dangerous trend that bears close watching. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Kashmiri  ] terrorist groups made numerous attacks on elected [MISC Indian  ] and [PER Kashmiri  ] politicians , targeted civilians in public areas , and attacked security forces , killing more than 500 civilians in 2005 , most of whom were [PER Kashmiri Muslims  ] . 
Attacks continued in 2006 , with democracy in [LOC Kashmir  ] a primary focus . 
Candidates and elected officials were attacked and murdered , and terrorists apparently prioritized deterring Kashmiris from voting . 
Coordinated attacks on several sites in central [LOC Srinagar  ] on April 16 underlined terrorists’ opposition to April 24 state assembly by-elections ( [ORG Septel  ] ) . 
[ORG Foreign Terrorist Organizations Lashkar-e-Tayyiba  ] ( [ORG LeT  ] ) and [PER Jaish-e-Mohammad  ] ( JeM ) , at times operating through front names from camps in [LOC Pakistan  ] , claimed responsibility for many of these attacks . 
Some of these groups maintain ties with al-Qaida , although the [MISC Indian  ] government takes pride in claiming there is no direct al-Qaida presence in the country outside of [LOC Kashmir  ] . 
Threat Assessment: Naxals a Rising Threat ----------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Indian  ] terrorism analysts -- in some respects more so than the [ORG GOI  ] -- are concerned that Naxal terrorism , which covers a broad region of [LOC Eastern  ] , Central , and [ORG Southern India  ] , is growing in sophistication and lethality and will be a significant long-term challenge . 
Unlike terrorists in [LOC Kashmir  ] , these Naxalite groups are not dependent on support from outside [LOC India  ] ; the [ORG GOI  ] and independent experts assess that Naxals purchase some weapons from [MISC Nepalese  ] Maoists , but ( per the [ORG GOI  ] ) “the relationship is commercial , not ideological” ( [ORG Septel  ] ) . 
The Naxals , such as those in the [ORG Communist Party of India-Maoist  ] , also are moving toward a more unified command system than the plethora of small jihadi groups that co-exist alongside [ORG LeT  ] and JeM . 
Furthermore , while jihadis are expanding their area of operations to conduct attacks , particularly in cities , Naxals are expanding the area of ( rural ) territory they effectively control ( i.e. collect taxes , adjudicate disputes , etc . 
) . <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Naxal groups often target [MISC Indian  ] security forces vice civilians . 
However , in [LOC West Bengal  ] , they have targeted members of the state ruling [ORG Communist Party of India  ] ( [MISC Marxist  ] ) , who are considered an ideological competitor by the [ORG Maoist Naxalites  ] . 
Overall deaths due to Naxal violence have remained relatively constant at approximately 500-600 [LOC NEW DELHI  ] 00002587 004 OF 012 annually in recent years . 
The two primary Naxalite groups in 2004 combined to form the banned [ORG Communist Party of India  ] ( [ORG Maoist  ] ) ; this construct continues to hold . 
PM Singh on April 13 publicly called [MISC Naxalism  ] “the single biggest internal security challenge” at a conclave of the chief ministers of the [MISC Naxal-affected  ] states ; how effective the [ORG GOI  ] and the state governments are in stemming this threat remains to be seen. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In September 2005 , the [ORG Indian Home Ministry  ] and the senior elected and bureaucratic officials from the 12 [MISC Naxal-affected  ] states ( [LOC Andhra Pradesh  ] , [LOC Bihar  ] , [LOC Chhattisgarh  ] , [LOC Himachal Pradesh  ] , [LOC Jharkand  ] , [LOC Karnataka  ] , [LOC Madhya Pradesh  ] , [LOC Maharashtra  ] , [LOC Orissa  ] , [LOC Tamil Nadu  ] , [LOC Uttar Pradesh  ] , and [LOC West Bengal  ] ) created an [ORG Interstate Task Force  ] to streamline regional anti-Naxal operations . 
The [ORG GOI  ] is also modernizing the weapons and equipment for state police forces in [MISC Naxal-affected  ] areas . 
Threat Assessment: [ORG Northeast Terrorism Not  ] a [ORG GOI  ] Priority --------------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Terrorism in India’s [MISC Northeast  ] states ( [LOC Arunachal Pradesh  ] , [LOC Assam  ] , [LOC Mizoram  ] , [LOC Manipur  ] , [LOC Nagaland  ] , [LOC Tripura  ] , and [ORG Meghalaya  ] ) consists of many groups -- some of which maintain bases in [LOC Bangladesh  ] , according to [ORG GOI  ] and [MISC Indian  ] media reports -- that are small in number compared to other terrorist organizations in [LOC India  ] , and their reach does not extend out of the region . 
Civilian deaths due to terrorism in the [MISC Northeast  ] have been declining in recent years , according to [MISC Indian  ] government data and a leading independent [MISC Indian  ] terrorism expert . 
For 2005 , between 300 and 350 civilians were killed in [MISC Northeast  ] terrorism . 
This variant of [MISC Indian  ] terrorism , like [MISC Naxalism  ] , attracts little attention from [LOC Delhi  ] . 
Why the [ORG GOI  ] Focuses on the Jihadis ---------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOI  ] does not focus on Naxalite or [MISC Northeast  ] terrorism with the intensity it devotes to jihadi terrorists , probably for a combination of the following reasons: -- Attacks by [ORG Naxalites  ] and [ORG Northeast  ] groups remain confined to rural areas far from [LOC New Delhi  ] . 
-- The Naxals generally target security forces vice civilians . 
-- The Naxals lack external support , which makes them a purely [MISC Indian  ] problem , something the [ORG GOI  ] cannot blame on other countries ; the [ORG GOI  ] blames [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Bangladesh  ] as instigators/supporters of jihadi terrorism , and [LOC Bangladesh  ] for also allowing [MISC Northeast  ] terrorists support or , at minimum , safe haven . 
The [ORG GOI  ] can and does exploit these links to attract international sympathy ( and partial absolution ) for its own domestic governance and border security short-comings . 
-- Because [ORG Naxalites  ] and [ORG Northeast  ] groups are treated as domestic issues , they are largely handled by the individual [LOC NEW DELHI  ] 00002587 005 OF 012 states in which these groups operate . 
The [ORG GOI  ] over the past year has tried to tie together the anti-Naxal efforts of the “Naxal-affected states , ” but to no discernible effect thus far , and the states lack the capacity to mount an effective response to the problem . 
-- The most likely solutions to the problems posed by the Naxal and [MISC Northeast  ] groups involve improving local/state governance and economic opportunity , a difficult and long-term solution for [LOC New Delhi  ] and the affected states to effect . 
[ORG Extraterritorial Dimensions of Terrorism in India  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [MISC Pakistan:  ] The prominent place jihadi terrorism plays in India’s threat perception is a significant irritant in [MISC Indo-Pakistan  ] relations . 
Recent [ORG GOI  ] public statements and [MISC Indian  ] media suggest [LOC Delhi  ] believes cross-border infiltration in March-April dropped significantly , perhaps nearly to zero in March largely due to severe snow conditions , but skeptics remain throughout the [MISC Indian  ] bureaucracy and security services . 
Most of our [ORG GOI  ] interlocutors believe [LOC Islamabad  ] opens and closes the spigot of cross-border terrorism to influence other aspects of bilateral affairs and to keep “the [LOC Kashmir  ] issue” on the front burner . 
[PER NSA Narayanan  ] in March told the [LOC UK  ] High Commissioner he was less worried about LoC infiltration than he was about [MISC Pakistani  ] intelligence support for terrorist modules elsewhere in [LOC India  ] -- such as the cells responsible for the [LOC Delhi  ] and [LOC Bangalore  ] attacks ( Ref G ) . 
Another growing concern is that jihadis are infiltrating into [ORG Northeast India  ] from [LOC Nepal  ] and [LOC Bangladesh.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [ORG Bangladesh:  ] The [ORG GOI  ] for years has insisted that [MISC Northeast  ] terrorist groups and , more recently , [MISC Pakistani  ] jihadi groups maintain bases on Dhaka’s side of the [MISC Indo-Bangladesh  ] border , and infiltrate across the lengthy , unfenced boundary back and forth at will , owing to a combination of poor governance , conducive terrain , bribery , and/or GOB facilitation ( or , at minimum , willfully ignoring [MISC Delhi’s  ] pleas ) ( Refs D , T-V ) . <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [MISC Nepal: As  ] noted above , the [ORG GOI  ] does not believe that domestic Naxals and [MISC Nepalese  ] [ORG Maoists  ] maintain any significant operational links , except for some commercial arms sales from the [MISC Nepalese  ] to the Naxals . 
[MISC Nepalese  ] [ORG Maoists  ] , however , appear to enjoy relatively free movement within [MISC Naxal-held  ] areas in [LOC India  ] along the 1,700 km open border . 
While we frequently hear reports of [MISC Nepalese  ] [ORG Maoist  ] leaders ( including the [ORG Number  ] 1 and [ORG Number  ] 2 [PER Prachanda  ] and [PER Baburam Bhattarai  ] ) spending long periods of time in [LOC India  ] with leftist sympathizers , the [ORG GOI  ] has assured us repeatedly that it gives no quarter to [MISC Nepalese  ] [ORG Maoists  ] , and several high-ranking [ORG Maoists  ] are being held in [MISC Indian  ] jails. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOI  ] also regularly tells us that [LOC Kathmandu  ] , including the airport , has become an operations hub for [ORG Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence  ] ( [ORG ISI  ] ) -supported terrorists , in large part due to its soft border with [LOC India  ] . 
Our interlocutors tell us the [ORG RGON  ] turns a blind eye to [LOC NEW DELHI  ] 00002587 006 OF 012 [MISC Delhi’s  ] complaints on this matter . 
Bioterrorism not on [MISC Delhi’s Radar ...  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Few [MISC Indians  ] -- [ORG GOI  ] , think-tanks , etc. -- are concerned about bioterrorism ( Septel ) . 
They generally view it as an over-the-horizon issue , whereas [ORG RDX  ] and [MISC AK-47s  ] exist in the here-and-now . 
Some terrorism analysts , including [ORG South Asia Terrorism Portal  ] editor [PER Ajai Sahni  ] , chalk this up to the “Panipat Syndrome” ( NOTE: According to India’s preeminent strategic thinker [PER K Subrahmanyam  ] , in three separate decisive battles , [MISC Indian  ] empires declined to defend themselves against [MISC Western  ] invaders by reinforcing strategic choke-points like the Khyber Pass . 
They instead waited for the advancing force to reach [LOC Panipat  ] -- a town only 40 miles from [LOC Delhi  ] , and over 450 miles after penetrating the Khyber -- before reacting. “Then mad panic and ineffectiveness , followed by a crushing defeat . 
A devastating lack of strategic sense , either in offense or defense.” End Note ) . 
One terrorism scholar who has edited three [MISC Indian  ] books on bio-terrorism told us that his books sell relatively well in the [LOC US  ] and [LOC Western Europe  ] , but not in [LOC India  ] . 
The Home and Health Ministries are lead agencies in this field , with the [ORG Agriculture Ministry  ] a possible player as well. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Controls at bio-tech facilities are weak to non-existent , making [MISC India’s  ] large industrial capacity a potential source of hazardous bio-materials if not bio-weapons . 
That said , bio-terrorism would at most appeal to the larger jihadi terrorist groups ( i.e . 
LeT and JeM ) . 
Naxals and [MISC Northeast  ] separatist terrorists rely more heavily on local support , their area of operations is limited to the territory they seek to “liberate , ” and they lack operational reach into [LOC Delhi  ] , all factors that suggest they would not seek to employ bio-terrorism . 
In a sign of latent awareness of this threat , however , the [ORG National Institute of Virology  ] in Pune will hold a biosecurity workshop May 2-4 with the cooperation of [ORG Sandia National Labs.  ] .. . 
Nor is [ORG WMD Terrorism  ] ------------------------ <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) Many of the same factors at play within the [ORG GOI  ] and terrorist groups active in [LOC India  ] regarding bio-terrorism also relate to [ORG WMD  ] terrorism more broadly . 
We have seen little evidence of [ORG GOI  ] interest or planning on the potential of [ORG WMD  ] terrorism . 
In fact , outside of a few [LOC New Delhi  ] think tanks , there appears to be no discourse on this topic whatsoever , with the exception of occasional ( and , to Mission’s knowledge , unfounded ) speculation on whether the [PER AQ Khan  ] proliferation network may have supplied nuclear materials to jihadi groups or al-Qaida . 
Many of the nuclear non-proliferation measures that the [ORG GOI  ] has undertaken , such as harmonization of its export controls with the [ORG NSG/MTCR  ] and installation of [ORG CSI  ] at the [LOC Mumbai Port  ] , also help prevent terrorists from acquiring or shipping WMD-related items . 
Cyber-Terrorism --------------- [LOC NEW DELHI  ] 00002587 007 OF 012 <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) Cyber-security , by contrast , is an increasing source of [MISC Indian  ] concern and focus . 
[LOC India  ] hosts a significant number of high-tech professionals , many of whom possess the skills to effect cyber-terrorism ; however , reports of “cyber-terrorism” in [LOC India  ] have heretofore related only to defacement of [ORG GOI  ] websites . 
We have seen no credible information about terrorist groups attempting to execute cyber-terrorists acts , although some groups are undoubtedly interested , and jihadi groups particularly are understood to use e-mail , [MISC Internet  ] chat services , and other digital communications platforms . 
That said , [MISC India’s  ] increasingly remote-controlled critical infrastructure ( energy generation , transportation , water and sanitation , communications , etc . 
) present tempting targets for tech-savvy terrorists. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) The [ORG National Security Council Secretariat  ] is the lead agency on cybersecurity and cyber-terrorism , and The Mission’s [ORG NSCS  ] interlocutors have been both knowledgeable about potential threats , energetic about trying to head them off , and open to bilateral assistance to protect critical systems , all pleasant surprises compared to our overall dealings with the [ORG GOI  ] . 
The [ORG US-India Cybersecurity Forum  ] , launched in 2000 as an outgrowth of our [LOC CT  ] cooperation , now evinces frequent and robust interaction at both the policymaker and technical levels ( Refs H , I , and L ) . 
The [ORG NSCS  ] is keen to engage in new subject areas , including protection of the above listed critical infrastructure services . 
Given this positive interaction and the fact that the [ORG NSCS  ] largely employs subject-matter experts vice generalists , it might be useful to pursue [ORG NSCS  ] branching out into other areas of [ORG USG  ] interest , such as bio- and [MISC WMD-terrorism  ] , in the hope that we can replicate the progress we have enjoyed in cybersecurity . 
Waging the “Battle of [MISC Ideas”  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) We can learn a great deal from [MISC India’s  ] management of its large society to minimize extremist ideologies . 
[LOC India  ] enjoys a democratic , multi-religious , multi-cultural , heterogeneous , multi-ethnic society where all major world religions are practiced freely . 
Isolated elements of religious extremism of many varieties have , however , occurred in [LOC India  ] -- notably among [MISC Hindus  ] , [MISC Muslims  ] , and [MISC Sikhs  ] -- although extremists as a whole are by far outnumbered by “secular” moderates . 
In the [MISC Indian  ] context , “secularism” is synonymous with tolerance for all faiths , and does not imply life devoid of religion , although religious freedom -- including atheism -- is protected and guaranteed by the [MISC Constitution  ] and a long history of court precedent . 
At a time when many nations appear to be losing ground to extremist movements , [MISC India’s  ] trendlines are pointing in the right direction , bolstered by strong indigenous traditions of communal co-habitation , non-violent political protest , a free press , and a realization by politicians that religious hatred is not a vote getter among the increasingly savvy , globalized , and prosperous [MISC Indian  ] electorate . 
Nevertheless , the risk always remains of isolated outbreaks of sectarian violence , especially in response to the terrorism that has [LOC NEW DELHI  ] 00002587 008 OF 012 plagued [LOC India  ] for decades , or when provoked by regional politicians for their narrow political purposes ( for example , the recently passed anti-conversion legislation in [LOC Rajasthan  ] , see Refs A and C ) . <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) Mission [LOC India  ] executes robust and forward leaning programming designed to counter extremist ideologies ( Ref O ) . 
We provide numerous exchange , educational , and outreach programs to counter extremism , primarily through the [ORG Front Office  ] , [ORG PA  ] , [ORG POL  ] , and [ORG USAID  ] . 
A special public diplomacy effort is made to engage with [MISC Indian  ] [MISC Muslims  ] , including young students and other young people , and to foster interfaith dialogue among [MISC India’s  ] multi-cultural and multi-religious communities . 
[ORG Front Office  ] , [ORG PA  ] , and [ORG POL  ] officers provide critical personal and media interaction to perpetuate the [ORG USG  ] message of moderation and tolerance . 
Our outreach ranges from one-on-one engagement with elites to press interviews to mass-audience interaction to overcome misperceptions and stereotypes . 
We also monitor and report trends in religious extremism . 
Terrorist Finance and [ORG Anti-Money Laundering Legislation  ] --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act  ] ( [ORG PMLA  ] ) , which came into effect in July 2005 , allows for the freezing , confiscation and seizure of instrumentalities used in , or intended for use in , terrorist financing in limited circumstances , and provides the statutory basis for setting up [ORG India’s Financial Intelligence Unit  ] ( [ORG FIU  ] ) . 
However , it does not cover properties , including non-cash assets , that are intended to be used by an individual terrorist , or property of corresponding value. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG PMLA  ] also aims to combat money laundering in [LOC India  ] and allows for confiscation and seizure of the property obtained from laundered money , but only when there is a conviction of a predicate offense . 
The [ORG PMLA  ] stipulates that whoever directly or indirectly attempts to indulge or knowingly assist , or is knowingly a party , or is actually involved in any process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime and projecting it as untainted property , shall be guilty of offenses of money-laundering . 
( For an in-depth assessment of the [ORG PMLA  ] and the [ORG FIU  ] , please see Ref B . 
) <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Top [ORG GOI  ] officials have publicly expressed their strong interest in [LOC India  ] becoming a member of the [ORG Egmont Group  ] and the [ORG Financial Action Task Force  ] ( [ORG FATF  ] ) . 
India’s Finance Ministry hosted a [ORG FATF  ] delegation on April 12-13 whose purpose was to determine if [LOC India  ] should be granted [ORG FATF  ] observer status ( Septel ) . 
The [ORG US Treasury Department’s FINCEN  ] and the [ORG FIU  ] are considering reciprocal visits for [MISC May-July  ] . 
Levels of cooperation are not where we would like them to be , although the trend lines are encouraging . 
[ORG Airline/Airport Security  ] and [ORG Anti-Hijacking Policy  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( C ) We have significant gaps in our understanding of how [LOC NEW DELHI  ] 00002587 009 OF 012 far the [ORG GOI  ] has come in operationalizing its new anti-hijacking policy since it was unveiled in August 2005 ( Ref P ) . 
Our understanding , based on [MISC Indian  ] press articles , is that the [MISC Indian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] ( [ORG IAF  ] ) is now allowed to counter a 9/11-like attempt to use aircraft as weapons of mass destruction by shooting them down ; airport ground crews are directed ( not simply “permitted” ) to attempt to keep a grounded , hijacked aircraft on the tarmac ; and negotiators are restricted in what they can offer terrorists in a hostage situation . 
The opacity of the [ORG Home Ministry  ] has been a significant obstacle in learning more ; our [MISC British  ] counterparts here report similar difficulty in getting to the ground truths here . 
Some of the questions that warrant probing include: -- More specifics on how the [ORG GOI  ] will accommodate foreign aircraft , including if a foreign plane is hijacked while in [MISC Indian  ] airspace . 
-- What additional equipment or training [MISC Indian  ] entities will require , and if there are opportunities for [ORG USG  ] training and [MISC American  ] firms . 
-- How first responders will prioritize between timeliness and chain-of-command in trying to make difficult decisions. <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The recent launch of two direct [MISC Delhi-US  ] flights ( Continental and [MISC American  ] ) and the expected announcement of several more such routes make this discussion of hijacking protocols particularly important . 
[ORG ATA Training  ] ------------ <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Forensics is weak in [LOC India  ] -- only two [MISC DNA  ] labs service the entire country . 
Few police officers outside major cities are trained in safeguarding and exploiting electronic data , although this capacity is expanding under indigenous cybersecurity training and cooperative training with [LOC US  ] government agencies . 
As a consequence , terrorism investigations and court cases tend to rely upon confessions , many of which are obtained under duress if not beatings , threats , or , in some cases , torture . 
These factors , along with a creaky and corrupt judiciary , contribute to cases lingering in the courts for years. <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC India  ] is a voracious consumer of [ORG ATA  ] training , having digested 42 courses involving 900 [MISC Indian  ] security officials and accepting some $10 million in equipment transfers since 1995 . 
The sheer size of [MISC India’s  ] police , paramilitary , and other security agencies at the state and federal levels , however , guarantees that an abundance of first responders and investigators will be behind the training curve . 
Our goal here is to rationalize [ORG ATA  ] training to create a more coherent syllabus that would address specific [MISC Indian  ] security needs , in cooperation with the [ORG GOI  ] and ( ideally ) with [MISC India’s  ] other [LOC CT  ] partners to avoid duplication of efforts . 
[ORG RSO  ] notes [MISC Indian  ] security agencies are enthusiastic about receiving [ORG ATA  ] training and graduates are being tasked with replicating courses , which they appear [LOC NEW DELHI  ] 00002587 010 OF 012 to be doing effectively ( Ref E ) . 
Other encouraging news is that course graduates include officers who have since been promoted to senior ranks and a recent recipient of the [ORG President’s Police Medal of Gallantry  ] . 
Information/Intelligence [ORG Sharing: Lost/Stolen Passports  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG GOI  ] has heretofore been reluctant in sharing its database of lost and stolen passports with [ORG INTERPOL  ] , a move which would greatly increase INTERPOL’s database ( and therefore our own ) . 
This CTJWG , coming more than 18 months after the prior JWG , will be an ideal time to reiterate this request . 
This has been an important initiative of the [ORG Bureau of Consular Affairs  ] , and an issue [ORG CA Assistant  ] Secretary [PER Maura Harty  ] raised at senior levels during visits to [LOC India  ] in 2005 . 
The [LOC US  ] routinely provides its lost and stolen passport data to [ORG Interpol  ] as a means of sharing this information with other nations , and [LOC India  ] should , too . 
Information/Intelligence [ORG Sharing: Investigations  ] --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par31' href='#par31'>¶</a>31 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While RSO’s liaison with the [MISC Indian  ] police is adequate , there is room for improvement . 
The [MISC Indian  ] bureaucracy stalls many investigative requests with demands for written letters to various offices , additional approvals , and the failure to pass correspondences between [MISC Indian  ] law enforcement agencies . 
The [ORG GOI  ] requires many [MISC US Embassy  ] sections and agencies to work directly with national-level counterparts ; however , the RSOs are free from this restriction and are able to interact with both the local and national police agencies throughout [LOC India  ] . 
[ORG RSO  ] and other [MISC Embassy  ] law enforcement elements must often pass investigative requests between [MISC Indian  ] law enforcement agencies , acting as the middle man , although the use of personal “unofficial” contacts can sometimes expedite an investigation . 
Information/Intelligence [ORG Sharing: Tactical Threat Reporting  ] --------------------------------------------- -------------- <a id='par32' href='#par32'>¶</a>32 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG RSO  ] sends the majority of threat information investigative requests to the [LOC New  ] [ORG Delhi Police Department’s Special Cell  ] , which is the primary law enforcement entity in [LOC New Delhi  ] tasked with the investigation of terrorist activity and major case investigations . 
As with all investigative efforts in [LOC India  ] the office is only as good as its local contacts ; the [ORG RSO  ] often has greater success by discreetly contacting a local officer in the [ORG Special Cell  ] in lieu of sending in an official request , many of which are not acted upon . 
[ORG RSO  ] receives very little follow-up information from [LOC Delhi  ] police after a terrorist attack , such as the status of the police investigations or efforts to apprehend suspects ; the information [ORG RSO  ] does receive is usually already available in the media. <a id='par33' href='#par33'>¶</a>33 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG RSO  ] has found that the sharing of tactical threat information with [LOC Delhi  ] police is woefully lacking . 
[ORG RSO  ] and the [ORG Emergency Action Committee  ] ( [ORG EAC  ] ) have been pushing the [LOC NEW DELHI  ] 00002587 011 OF 012 [ORG GOI  ] , to date unsuccessfully , to establish a liaison position that would serve as a real-time clearinghouse for threat information and coordinating responses to imminent threats . 
Post would appreciate if this request could be raised again during the [LOC CTWG.  ] <a id='par34' href='#par34'>¶</a>34 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As noted above , much [LOC CT  ] activity happens at the state level . 
[MISC India’s  ] lack of a national crime database seriously inhibits [LOC CT  ] analysis and cooperation among the states and between states and the federal security services ( [ORG CBI  ] and [ORG IB  ] ) , and allows terrorists to potentially take advantage of crossing from one jurisdiction to another to escape detection and broaden their attack patterns . 
[ORG MLAT Implementation  ] ------------------- <a id='par35' href='#par35'>¶</a>35 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG US-India MLAT  ] came into effect in October 2005 . 
In November , the [ORG USG  ] requested [ORG GOI  ] assistance under [ORG MLAT  ] regarding a joint [ORG DEA-Indian Narcotics Control Board  ] ( [ORG NCB  ] ) investigation -- the [ORG DEA  ] requested that the [ORG NCB  ] provide documentary evidence and testimony from an [ORG NCB  ] officer for the criminal trial in the [LOC US  ] of a co-conspirator in a case involving [MISC Internet  ] pharmaceuticals trade . 
The [ORG GOI  ] in February 2006 provided documentary evidence that was forwarded to the [LOC US  ] , but the request for an [ORG NCB  ] officer to testify was not honored despite repeated high-level interventions by the [MISC Embassy  ] , and there has been no official explanation why the officer was not sent to the [LOC US  ] . 
Informal feedback received by [ORG DEA  ] indicates the [ORG GOI  ] is unclear on whether [ORG MLAT  ] covers this type of request . 
It will be important to schedule formal implementation talks soon , either in [LOC Washington  ] , or probably most effectively in [LOC New Delhi  ] . 
DOJ’s office of [ORG International Affairs  ] will likely have the lead in this area . 
Other Issues the [ORG GOI  ] May Raise ------------------------------ <a id='par36' href='#par36'>¶</a>36 . 
( C ) IC-814: Repeated [ORG GOI  ] demarches last year seeking information on the December 1999 IC-814 hijackers suggest that some [LOC CT  ] interlocutors [LOC Delhi  ] believe the [ORG USG  ] has additional information or access that could be useful in the trial of the hijackers , several of whom are being tried in absentia ( Refs M and S ) . 
We have provided considerable information in response to [ORG GOI  ] requests . 
This is an issue that largely remains dormant but flares up from time to time , and the [ORG GOI  ] may view the CTJWG as an opportunity to renew its request. <a id='par37' href='#par37'>¶</a>37 . 
( C ) [ORG Dawood Ibrahim: Mumbai  ] crime boss and [ORG Specially Designated Global Terrorist  ] [PER Dawood Ibrahim  ] is wanted by [MISC Indian  ] police for having planned and financed thirteen explosions in [LOC Mumbai  ] in 1993 that killed almost 300 civilians ; he reportedly now lives in [LOC Pakistan  ] and the [LOC UAE  ] , an assertion bolstered by periodic reporting in [LOC Pakistan  ] news magazines ( see below ) . 
He is also wanted for arms smuggling , counterfeiting , narcotics trafficking , murder , and other criminal matters . 
Dawood’s daughter’s July 2005 high-profile wedding reception brazenly took place at the [ORG Grand Hyatt NEW DELHI  ] 00002587 012 OF 012 Hotel in [LOC Dubai  ] , and was the more recent rubbing of salt in this festering sore ( [ORG Ref R  ] ) . <a id='par38' href='#par38'>¶</a>38 . 
( C ) The “List of 20”: The prior ( [ORG Vajpayee  ] ) government had sent to [LOC Islamabad  ] a request to extradite twenty terrorists and criminals that many in the [ORG GOI  ] believe reside in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
The list includes the leaders of [LOC JeM  ] , LeT and [ORG Hizbul Mujahedeen  ] ; [PER Dawood Ibrahim  ] and six members of his criminal organization , including several the [ORG GOI  ] linked to the 1993 [LOC Mumbai  ] bomb blasts or a conspiracy to kill former Home Minister [PER LK Advani  ] ; four terrorists wanted for their roles in the IC-814 hijacking ; and five [PER Khalistani  ] ( [MISC Sikh  ] separatist ) terrorists . 
When in power , the [ORG BJP  ] government used phe “List of 20” as a club with which to publicly beat [LOC Pakistan  ] ; the current [ORG UPA  ] government has only recently revived the issue , and then in the less political context of a law enforcement bilateral . 
However , one of our main [LOC CT  ] interlocutors , [PER Ajai Sahni  ] , told us recently that “the best thing [LOC Pakistan  ] could do is to turn those guys over to the [MISC Indian  ] government , but [LOC Delhi  ] would undoubtedly make a hash of it.” Comment: Opportunity to Move Ahead ---------------------------------- <a id='par39' href='#par39'>¶</a>39 . 
( C ) This JWG offers an opportunity much like the July 18 agreement to set ambitious goals and strive to meet them . 
The challenge is to build on recent successes in the broader bilateral relationship to move our counterterrorism agenda forward at a faster pace and to a deeper end . 
Critical to this effort is a [ORG GOI  ] decision to boost intel exchange if we are to move beyond rhetoric in our [LOC CT  ] relationship . 
[ORG Mission Station  ] Chief will participate in the CTJWG meetings and brief Mr. [PER Crumpton  ] beforehand .
