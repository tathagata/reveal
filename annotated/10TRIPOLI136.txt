Cretz  ] , Ambassador , [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] , [ORG Department of State  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: On February 10 , the Ambassador briefed [PER Jamal  ] al-Lamushie , Secretary of the [ORG Privatization and Investment Board  ] ( [ORG PIB  ] ) , on the upcoming [ORG U.S. Trade Mission  ] and discussed the status of [LOC Libya  ] 's privatization efforts thus far . 
[PER Al-Lamushie  ] and his staff reiterated an interest in technical assistance and training in best practices for privatization . 
Such a program would further economic ties between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Libya  ] , and would provide a view into what is an otherwise opaque and unpredictable process . 
[PER Al-Lamushie  ] , who also serves as Director of the [ORG General Board  ] of [MISC Fairs  ] , made a pitch for [LOC U.S.  ] participation at the annual [ORG Tripoli International Fair  ] . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The new head of the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Privatization and Investment Board  ] , [PER Jamal  ] al-Lamushie , told the Ambassador ( accompanied by econoff ) during a February 10 meeting that [LOC U.S.  ] companies are welcome in [LOC Libya  ] , and to that end , pledged to help arrange meetings for the upcoming [ORG U.S. Trade Mission  ] . 
In al-Lamushie 's view , most [MISC Libyans  ] are pro-U.S. , but , he believes some [MISC Americans  ] have negative views of [LOC Libya  ] due to the media . 
He said " we consider you as a friend , and we are all part of one team , to make the trade mission a success . 
" [PER Al-Lamushie  ] , who replaced Mahamud al-Ftise as head of Privatization on December 28 , explained that he will also retain his other role , as General Secretary of the [ORG General Board  ] of [MISC Fairs  ] . 
( Note: Dr. al-Ftise 's new role , if any , is still unclear . 
According to the [LOC Tripoli  ] rumor mill , he is now in charge of the [ORG government-owned Steel Factory  ] in [LOC Misurata  ] . 
) [PER Al-Lamushie  ] was accompanied by a new member of his staff , Dr. [PER Abdelkarim Mgeg  ] . 
PRIVATIZATION AND INVESTMENT BOARD WELCOMES [LOC U.S.  ] COMPANIES <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Al-Lamushie  ] noted that [LOC Libya  ] was " speeding up " the process of privatization , in which nearly 20 state-owned enterprises will be either liquidated , sold to employees , or sold to investors . 
He said foreign investors are now able to partner with [MISC Libyan  ] companies , either from the private or public sectors , in joint ventures at up to 60 percent ownership . 
He thought the remaining larger projects could be of interest to foreign investors , such as the petrochemical plant in [PER Abe Kamash  ] near Qe [MISC Tunisian  ] border , the truck factory in [LOC Tajura  ] , the [ORG Steel Factory  ] in [LOC Misurata  ] , and several oil services companies . 
He noted that 110 companies had been privatized ( as reported in ref A ) and that almost all were doing well , but admitted that 10-15 were " not doing soQell " and would probably not be of interest to investors . 
[PER SAADI  ] AL-QADHAFI'S PET PROJECT: ZWARA [LOC ECONOMIC CITY  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Addressing recent reports of a new law enacted by the General People 's [ORG Congress  ] establishing a free-trade zone in [LOC Zwara  ] ( west of [LOC Tripoli  ] ) , al-Lamushie said further details on the " [LOC Economic City  ] " would be announced in two weeks . 
( One of [MISC Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi 's sons , [PER Saadi  ] , is in charge of the project to transform the western side of [LOC Libya  ] 's coastal area into an economic zone , ref B ) . 
He clarified the project would not be a " free trade zone " but rather , an " economic city " with a special status . 
In order to roll out the project , " special seminars " will be held for foreign companies in [LOC Libya  ] and overseas . 
He said such seminars could even take place in the [LOC U.S.  ] , if there was interest . 
FOCUS ON ALTERNATIVE ENERGY: NUCLEAR , [ORG SOLAR  ] , WIND <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Beyond its role in privatization , al-Lamushie said the [ORG PIB  ] was also charged with attracting companies with expertise in new , alternative forms of energy , such as nuclear , solar , and wind power sources . 
He said that Dr. [PER Abdelkarim Mgeg  ] , a former nuclear scientist , was responsible for reaching out to companies working in alternative energy sources . 
[PER Mgeg  ] noted that [LOC Libya  ] 's goal was to diversify its energy mix . 
( Note: [PER Mgeg  ] is a familiar face to the Embassy , having worked with [LOC U.S.  ] scientists when he was the Director of [ORG Tajura Nuclear Research Center  ] , and he has stayed in touch with us since leaving that position in late 2008 . 
He had been planning to travel to the [LOC U.S.  ] in January to meet with [ORG Solar Energy  ] companies and to attend a conference on this topic , but his trip was postponed for work-related reasons ; he hopes to reschedule . 
End note ) . 
POSSIBLE GREEN ENERGY BRIEFING FOR CODEL GRAYSON <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador noted that Congressman [PER Alan Grayson  ] would be transiting [LOC Tripoli  ] on February 17 for a few hours , and [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000136 002.2 OF 002 due to his interest in green technologies , would be interested to receive a briefing on [LOC Libya  ] 's efforts in this area . 
[PER Al-Lamushie  ] said that Dr. [PER Mgeg  ] could meet with the Congressman , provided the meeting was approved by the [ORG MFA  ] . 
Post will follow-up . 
RENEWED INTEREST IN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG PIB  ] staff voiced renewed interest in cooperating with Post on the development of [LOC Libya  ] 's private sector , via activities such as training and technical assistance for the [ORG PIB  ] staff in best practices concerning privatization , as well as training for managers and boards of directors of newly-privatized companies . 
( Comment: Under al-Ftise 's leadership , no one from [ORG PIB  ] followed up with the Embassy on this proposed cooperation , but the new leadership may give a new push to bilateral cooperation . 
End comment ) . 
AND A PLUG FOR THE [ORG TRIPOLI INTERNATIONAL FAIR  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Putting on his other hat ( as head of the [ORG General Board  ] of [MISC Fairs  ] ) , al-Lamushie pointed out that there has been no [LOC U.S.  ] booth at the past two [ORG Tripoli International Fairs  ] . 
He encouraged the Ambassador to organize a [LOC U.S.  ] booth at the 39th [ORG Tripoli International Fair  ] , to be held April 2-12 . 
( Note: Interest in this event has waned on the part of companies after the lifting of sanctions , as there are now many tradeshows that are more useful to companies . 
The [ORG Tripoli International Fair  ] tends to attract [MISC Libyan  ] consumers looking for unusual and inexpensive imported goods . 
) COMMENT <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Based on his comments and plans , it appears that al-Lamushie may have been brought in to ramp up the pace of revitalizing [LOC Libya  ] 's commercial sector . 
[PER Al-Lamushie  ] 's warm welcome to [LOC U.S.  ] firms and interest in technical assistance and training in best practices for privatization are a welcome change from his predecessor 's attitude toward bilateral cooperation . 
Post recommends following-up on this request as it would further economic ties between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Libya  ] , and also would provide a view into what is otherwise an opaque and unpredictable process .
