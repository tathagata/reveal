( A ) EMBASSY [LOC PARIS  ] DAILY REPORT FOR FEBRUARY 6 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
2006 AND PRIOR ( WWW.STATE.SGOV.GOV/P/EUR/PARIS/INDEX.CFM ) [ORG Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor  ] [PER Josiah Rosenblatt  ] for reaso ns 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: EUR Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary [PER Kurt Volker  ] reviewed on February 3 with [PER Patrick Devedjian  ] , a former industry minister and key advisor to Interior Minister [ORG Sarkozy  ] , how a possible [ORG Sarkozy  ] administration would likely approach relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Devedjian  ] said a [ORG Sarkozy  ] administration would make " economic gestures " in connection with the reconstruction of [LOC Iraq  ] to signal -- as much as domestic [MISC French  ] opinion would allow -- [LOC France  ] 's more active association with [LOC U.S.  ] goals in the region . 
[PER Devedjian  ] acknowledged that a [ORG Sarkozy  ] victory in 2007 is far from a sure thing , while discounting Prime Minister [PER de Villepin  ] 's chances of pushing [ORG Sarkozy  ] aside as leader of the center-right governing party . 
[PER Devedjian  ] acknowledged that the unexpectedly persistent popularity of [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PS  ] ) dark horse [PER Segolene Royal  ] ( ref A ) was an unforeseen development that is forcing contenders of both left and right to revisit their electoral calculations , even if he did not believe she could win in the end . 
END SUMMARY . 
WHAT TO EXPECT FROM A [ORG SARKOZY  ] ADMINISTRATION -------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) " We will make economic gestures with regard to the [LOC Iraq  ] situation " is how [PER Devedjian  ] expressed what would be a new [MISC French  ] willingness , under a [ORG Sarkozy  ] administration , to more actively support [LOC U.S.  ] goals in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Devedjian  ] , evoking the strand of anti-Americanism that persists in [LOC France  ] and the widespread public hostility to the [MISC U.S.-led  ] invasion of [LOC Iraq  ] , cautioned however that how much [LOC France  ] might be able to do along these lines depended on what would be " politically possible " at the time . 
[PER Devedjian  ] did not specify what those " economic gestures " might be . 
[PER Comment: Increases  ] in development aid and , possibly further debt forgiveness , could be what he had in mind . 
End Commentg. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Devedjian  ] used the phrase " Atlanticist and communitarian " to describe [ORG Sarkozy  ] 's overall outlook , and to distinguish it from that of [PER Villepin  ] , which is often described as " nationalist and [MISC Republican  ] . 
" [PER Devedjian  ] underlined that " we will not be ceding to an anti-American campaign , " notwithstanding the efforts of [ORG Sarkozy  ] 's opponents to try and tar [ORG Sarkozy  ] as pro-American . 
[PER Devedjian  ] made clear that not only would the [ORG Sarkozy  ] campaign not engage in any outbidding of the opposition in anti-Americanism , but that it would also make every effort to avoid " bringing the [LOC U.S.  ] into our domestic politics . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In response to PDAS [PER Volker  ] 's hope that , at [ORG NATO  ] , a [ORG Sarkozy  ] victory might result in useful , operationally consequential changes in [MISC French  ] behavior , [PER Devedjian  ] lamented that the [MISC French  ] press and public " are not interested in [ORG NATO  ] . 
" This has permitted President [PER Chirac  ] , he said , to conduct [MISC French  ] policy in [ORG NATO  ] beyond public scrutiny , without accountability for the consequences . 
[PER Devedjian  ] suggested that [MISC French  ] institutional reforms proposed by [ORG Sarkozy  ] , specifically , an [MISC NSC-like  ] coordinating mechanism for foreign policy and periodic reports by the president to the parliament on current issues , could have the effect of bringing [LOC France  ] 's [ORG NATO  ] policy out of the shadows . 
This might eventually lead to a more positive appreciation of [ORG NATO  ] 's role by the [MISC French  ] public . 
LONG , UNCERTAIN ROAD TO 2007 ---------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Getting to a [ORG Sarkozy  ] administration in 2007 , as [PER Devedjian  ] soberly acknowledged , was far from a foregone conclusion . 
[PER Devedjian  ] believed that [ORG Sarkozy  ] 's " type of leadership " -- " the hands-on leadership " seen in [ORG Sarkozy  ] 's successful , personal management of the security response to the urban unrest that swept [LOC France  ] last fall , along with the " rupture " with past practice advocated by [ORG Sarkozy  ] -- are what the [MISC French  ] people truly want . 
[PER Devedjian  ] specified that by " rupture with the past , " [ORG Sarkozy  ] primarily means slimming down a bloated and pervasive state that stifles growth by taking too big a share of national wealth and which undermines individual initiative and commercial innovation by over-regulation of business activity . 
[PER Devedjian  ] underlined that voters want " renewal , " and he musingly volunteered that [LOC PARIS  ] 00000953 002 OF 003 " [ORG Sarkozy  ] on the right , and [PER Segolene  ] ( [PER Royal  ] ) on the left " were " the two candidates that would most respond to this desire for change . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Devedjian  ] confidently dismissed the possibility of Prime Minister [PER de Villepin  ] mounting a successful campaign to replace [ORG Sarkozy  ] as the candidate of the center-right in 2007 . 
[PER Devedjian  ] said that " [PER Villepin  ] and [ORG Sarkozy  ] are in agreement " that some sort of primary process should decide a single nominee for their party , the [ORG UMP  ] . 
[PER Devedjian  ] observed that [PER Villepin  ] won't challenge [ORG Sarkozy  ] for control of the party so long as [ORG Sarkozy  ] clearly benefits from both firm command of the party and a healthy public image . 
He added that [PER Villepin  ] " has always counted on [ORG Sarkozy  ] 's self-destruction -- which he 's been counting on in vain since 2002 . 
" [PER Devedjian  ] alluded to [PER Villepin  ] 's view that [ORG Sarkozy  ] 's personality -- somehow , not presidential -- would in the long run work to shift the support of the center-right to [ORG Villepin.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Turning to the potential opposition to [ORG Sarkozy  ] on the center-left , [PER Devedjian  ] clucked at the long-running , confused contentiousness in the [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PS  ] ) over both who will lead the party and what the party will stand for in <a id='par2007' href='#par2007'>¶</a>2007 . 
In [PER Devedjian  ] 's view , [ORG neither Party First  ] Secretary [PER Francois Hollande  ] nor any of the party 's mainstream figures are likely to make compelling candidates . 
Asked to assess the option for the socialists of " bringing back [PER Jospin  ] " -- that is , unifying the divided [ORG PS  ] under former Prime Minister [PER Lionel Jospin  ] -- [PER Devedjian  ] declared that " [PER Jospin  ] isn't the future , he 's the past -- and that 's not what voters are looking for . 
" As for the popular President of the [LOC Poitou-Charentes Region  ] , [PER Segolene Royal  ] , [PER Devedjian  ] said that , despite her appeal to voters wanting change , " [PER Segolene  ] has no chance " of winning the [ORG PS  ] nomination. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Devedjian  ] pointed out that [PER Royal  ] had in preceding days made statements in support of " Blairist " policies to address some of [LOC France  ] 's economic problems . 
" The only other Blairists in the [ORG PS  ] are [PER Kouchner  ] and [PER Bockel  ] , " [PER Devedjian  ] summed up . 
( Note and comment: Former Health Minster [PER Bernard Kouchner  ] and Mayor of Mulhouse [PER Jean-Marie Bockel  ] are the [ORG PS  ] 's most outspoken " liberals . 
" Adoption of anything resembling their views is out of the question for the vast majority of [ORG PS  ] party members . 
Even so , [PER Devedjian  ] 's inference is disingenuous -- [PER Royal  ] is exceedingly popular among party members . 
End note and comment . 
) Reflecting on how [PER Royal  ] 's popularity -- the emergence of her candidacy as a potentially serious one -- has upset the calculations of contenders on both left and right , [PER Devedjian  ] joked , " Now that she 's wound up and going , even [PER Francois Hollande  ] must realize she 's not going to quit at his , or anybody else 's say so . 
" ( [PER Note: Royal  ] and [PER Hollande  ] have been domestic partners for over 20 years . 
End Note . 
) [PER Devedjian  ] reprised the familiar refrain that [PER Royal  ] 's personality , allegedly both disagreeable and brittle , is not up to carrying the weight of the presidency . 
Implying that this unfitness for the job would become evident in due time , [PER Devedjian  ] said that " Everybody who knows her knows it , [PER Francois Hollande  ] most of all . 
" PARTICIPANTS ------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Devejian was accompanied by the [ORG UMP  ] 's Director for International Affairs , [PER Pascal Drouhaut  ] and a staff assistant , [PER Marie-Celie Guillaume  ] . 
PDAS [PER Volker  ] was accompanied by [PER POl M-C  ] and PolOff . 
[PER Devedjian  ] and [PER Volker  ] parted agreeing to stay in touch -- in particular , should [PER Devedjian  ] , [PER Drouhaut  ] or other [ORG Sarkozy  ] advisors travel to [LOC Washington  ] in the near future . 
SARKOZY'S ADVISORS ------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [ORG Sarkozy  ] 's inner circle of political allies and advisors consists of [PER Francois Fillon  ] , [PER Brice Hortefeux  ] and [PER Patrick Devedjian  ] . 
[PER Hortefeux  ] is currently Junior Minister ( for [LOC Territorial Collectivities  ] ) under [ORG Sarkozy  ] at the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] . 
[PER Fillon  ] and [PER Devedjian  ] , who were members of the government of [PER Jean-Pierre Rafferin  ] , were excluded from the current [PER Villepin  ] government precisely because of their closeness to [ORG Sarkozy  ] . 
Under [PER Rafferin  ] , [PER Fillon  ] was Minister of Education and [PER Devedjian  ] was Junior Minister for Industry . 
Both now have positions in the [ORG UMP  ] , and devote themselves full-time to making [PER Nicholas Sarkozy  ] the next president of [LOC France  ] . 
[PER Fillon  ] tends to take the lead in the fashioning of [ORG Sarkozy  ] 's policy proposals , while [PER Devedjian  ] tends to focus on [LOC PARIS  ] 00000953 003 OF 003 tactics for countering other contenders and on strategy for getting the votes to win . 
[PER Fillon  ] is considered a likely candidate for prime minister , with [PER Devedjian  ] at Justice or [ORG Interior  ] , should [ORG Sarkozy  ] win in 2007. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 .
