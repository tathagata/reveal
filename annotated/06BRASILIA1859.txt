[LOC BRASILIA  ] 1670 Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR DENNIS HEARNE . 
REASONS: 1.4 ( B ) ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In my first weeks in [LOC Brazil  ] , I reached out to a wide group of government policy makers , political leaders , business representatives , leading journalists , and representatives of civil society . 
I found a remarkable interest in strengthening bilateral relations . 
I met early on with Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] and [PER Lula  ] 's foreign policy advisor , [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] , and also had highly productive discussions with Justice Minister [PER Bastos  ] , [PER Lula  ] 's Chief of Staff for Policy [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] , Finance Minister [PER Mantega  ] , Trade Minister [PER Furlan  ] , [ORG Central Bank  ] President [PER Meirelles  ] , [ORG Supreme Court  ] President [PER Ellen Gracie Northfleet  ] , congressional leaders [PER Renan Calheiros  ] ( [ORG Senate  ] President ) and [PER Aldo Rebelo  ] ( [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] President ) and former President [PER Fernando Henrique Cardoso  ] , among many others . 
I met with most of the [MISC CEOs  ] of the largest [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] companies , including the media companies. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In these meetings , there emerged a number of key themes that I believe we must focus on going forward. --Business and investment are on everyone 's mind ; --There is a skepticism about the level of the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC South America  ] , and a lack of visibility in [LOC Brazil  ] of the positive side of [LOC America  ] -- and what we have done and what we can do ; -- The [PER Lula  ] government has been tensely balanced until now with a conservative fiscal policy on one end , and an ideologically leftist foreign policy on the other ; questions abound as to whether this will change in a second [PER Lula  ] government , and whether there are ways to shift the balance in a promising way . 
( Bio-fuels may be one important tool for doing this . 
) Business and Investment ----------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Across the range of my contacts with business , government , and political figures , I heard one message: There is a high degree of interest in increasing [LOC U.S.  ] trade and investment , expanding existing commercial relations , and creating new public-private partnerships . 
This sentiment could even be heard from [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] , whose ideological history as a militant leftist would hardly suggest such an entrepreneurial spirit ( see ref A ) . 
The energy is generalized , but often focused on specific questions of the moment. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A common refrain , for example , was [LOC Brazil  ] 's desire to retain eligibility under [ORG GSP  ] as the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] debates renewal of the authorizing statute . 
After moving our way on copyright piracy over the past 18 months , under the threat of [ORG USG  ] revocation of [ORG GSP  ] , the [MISC Brazilians  ] now believe that it is unfair to cast them out of the program because of unrelated factors . 
I am concerned that should we proceed down that direction , this could cast a shadow over the increasingly positive dialogue that we are constructing , and could play into the hands of the far left here . 
We need to keep flexibility on this , as [ORG GSP  ] can be a powerful tool in the future . 
Many are also enthused about the [MISC Commercial Dialogue  ] that Secretary [PER Gutierrez  ] and the Minister of Trade initiated in June , and the latter is seeking a return meeting with the Secretary in October . 
We are also looking forward to SIPDIS Treasury Secretary [PER Paulson  ] 's visit , which will hopefully focus on more of the micro details of the [MISC Brazilian  ] economy [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001859 002 OF 004 which [PER Lula  ] 's government says would be their focus in a second term. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) There is also an increase in investments between [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] with [ORG Petrobras  ] , [ORG Embraer  ] , steel , construction and textiles firms all playing major roles . 
The increasing importance of large industrial companies -- both [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] -- cannot be overstated . 
Just recently , [PER Lula  ] reached out to 25 of the largest companies at a dinner that included [MISC American  ] companies . 
Large [MISC Brazilian  ] companies ( e.g. , [ORG Petrobras  ] ) are interested in [LOC IPR  ] and international tax treatment . 
In the future they will begin to change the balance of the debate . 
Many large companies also are voicing their deep concern about [LOC Venezuela  ] 's participation in [LOC Mercosul  ] . 
I believe we should be able to leverage the concerns of these companies to effect salutary changes in policy in a GOB that is ever more attentive to the views of these powerful actors , the " stakeholders " in [LOC Brazil  ] 's economy . 
Skepticism and Visibility ----------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) There is skepticism here about the depth of [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to its relationship with [LOC Brazil  ] , and to the region as a whole . 
There is a related dearth of visibility on the positive side of [LOC America  ] , of what [LOC America  ] has done , including our historic concern for the common welfare and our tradition of corporate responsibility and community service . 
We should find ways to change these perceptions , focusing on specific projects and partnerships that demonstrate our commitment and genuine concern for [LOC Brazil  ] 's people. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) For example , we should be more engaged in [LOC Brazil  ] 's northeast , a region of more than 50 million people , with huge disparities in income distribution and a living standard below that of [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
In fact , this region could be the second largest country in size and population in [LOC South America  ] . 
We need to restore and energize our [ORG AID  ] programs and work with our corporate community , which is already very much engaged in corporate responsibility . 
A re-energized focus through [ORG USAID  ] on health issues - especially TB , [PER Malaria  ] , and [MISC HIV-AIDS  ] - would be one place to start , using our own direct action and seed money , and I believe we could then bring private sector partners in to multiply our impact. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Crime is a perennial concern in this violent country and an area where we can have a significant impact . 
In my meeting with Justice Minister [PER Bastos  ] ( ref B ) , he asked urgently when our Attorney General could come to [LOC Brazil  ] , and this presents a sterling opportunity to both address a [MISC Brazilian  ] plea for immediate assistance in dealing with their public security crisis , and to establish the basis for a regular consultative process , biannually , between our [ORG AG  ] and the Justice Minister. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Indeed , I am convinced that bringing high-level [ORG USG  ] officials to [LOC Brazil  ] can pave the way for dramatically enhanced cooperation , building a top-down momentum that can help [LOC Brazil  ] address these critical democracy and stability issues , while changing perceptions that we are not committed or engaged . 
In addition to the [ORG AG  ] visit , we could bring the [ORG DEA  ] Administrator and an expert delegation to discuss crime and narcotrafficking . 
In fact , the Governor of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] and the Mayor of Rio are also requesting high visibility visits from law enforcement officials . 
It is also important to maintain a regular schedule for our existing bilateral meetings , such as our P level political talks . 
[ORG U.S. Supreme Court Justices  ] could bring their perspectives to [MISC Brazilian  ] counterparts grappling with judicial reform . 
Balancing Acts - Ideology , [MISC Pragmatism  ] and Democracy [ORG BRASILIA  ] 00001859 003 OF 004 --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The conservative and pragmatic fiscal policy pursued successfully by [PER Lula  ] has been in tense balance with a foreign policy that is ideologically-skewed to the left , in strategic , trade and commercial issues . 
The south-south orientation that saw [LOC Brazil  ] clumsily declare [LOC China  ] a market economy , fumble its campaign for a permanent [MISC UNSC  ] seat , and embark on dubious efforts to strengthen economic ties with [MISC Arab  ] states and other marginal players at the expense of traditional relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Europe  ] , has established a foreign policy record that is tough to defend against attacks in the opposition and the media . 
There is some concern that [PER Lula  ] and his [MISC Amorim-led  ] foreign policy team could , in a second term , radicalize [LOC Brazil  ] 's foreign policy further away from interests and partnerships that can best serve [LOC Brazil  ] and our bilateral relationship . 
I believe we can help to diminish this risk by taking a practical approach that draws [LOC Brazil  ] into collaboration with us in areas that clearly hold promise for both countries , such as energy and law enforcement. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) We need to get away from ideological labels and find common ground . 
A superb means for doing this is cooperation on bio-fuels . 
The [MISC Brazilians'  ] view that bio-fuels represent a transformational technology in which they are global leaders is one we should embrace and use as the basis for cooperation on a strategic level . 
It is very evident to me that in research and development , in elaboration of poverty alleviation initiatives for third countries , and in building new multilateral fora for policy discussions , we have the potential to work closely with the [MISC Brazilians  ] in bio-fuels . 
They want this , we want it , and it can potentially serve as a vehicle for improving bilateral relations across the board without any ideological considerations. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) There is a broad consensus that [LOC Brazil  ] must continue to strengthen its already robust democracy , and , in the words of [LOC Presidential  ] advisor [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] , " bring the benefits of democracy to our poorest citizens . 
" The sentiment is universal ; however , the initial reaction to Dr. [PER Krasner  ] 's trip clearly illustrates the concerns of [LOC Brazil  ] of being too aligned with [MISC American  ] foreign policy interest ( ref c ) . 
As Itamaraty Under Secretary for Political Affairs [PER Antonio de Aguiar Patriota  ] related to me: [LOC Brazil  ] does not want to be stereotyped as being in " Our Camp . 
" I think that a follow up trip , perhaps by Under Secretary [PER Paula Dobriansky  ] , that revisits the democratic governance issue will be more successful , if it is not perceived as exclusively an [MISC American  ] policy initiative . 
We need to get away from labels that are seen as ideological , such as [ORG FTAA  ] . 
What we need to do is progress incrementally , without labels , perhaps taking a slower approach that will eventually achieve our foreign policy objectives . 
A Legacy and a Future --------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Lula  ] in a second term ( should he win one ) will be thinking of his legacy , his opponents will be looking toward the future , but most [MISC Brazilians  ] seem to want many of the same things . 
It was interesting to talk to former President [PER Fernando Henrique Cardoso  ] about his interest in a grand coalition . 
President [PER Lula  ] clearly has an ability to build upon his economic achievements and perhaps redefine his government in a possible second term , without the need to balance it with a strongly ideological foreign policy . 
We cannot tell [MISC Brazilians  ] how to shape their legacy and future , how to build up their democracy or bring in more investment or institute vital reforms , but we can offer our own experiences in relevant areas , and continue to press the [ORG BRASILIA  ] 00001859 004 OF 004 message that their ability to build the prosperity they seek rides on achieving these changes . 
There are ways we can help , and in so doing , we also will bolster the bilateral relationship and our own vital interests .
