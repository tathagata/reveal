( [ORG S/NF  ] ) SUMMARY: S/WCI Ambassador [PER Williamson  ] met with [MISC French  ] [ORG MFA  ] officials on February 16 to discuss detainee issues , [LOC France  ] 's role in the [ORG EU  ] process and possible resettlement of [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] detainees in [LOC France  ] . 
[PER Williamson  ] noted that [LOC France  ] has a unique role to play in formulating a process within the [ORG European Union  ] ( [ORG EU  ] ) to accept detainees and helping assuage the concerns of member states that might stymie [ORG EU  ] consensus on the issue . 
[ORG Foreign Ministry  ] Director of Communications and spokesman [PER Eric Chevallier  ] reiterated [LOC France  ] 's willingness to assist the [LOC U.S.  ] on this issue ( ref b and c ) , but noted that the [ORG GOF  ] position was " very clear " : detainees would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis ; the detainee had to specifically request resettlement in [LOC France  ] ; and [LOC France  ] would need full information on interested detainees to review any security and judicial implications . 
[PER Chevallier  ] said the [ORG GOF  ] supports an open [ORG EU  ] process that would allow decisions to be made on a national basis , similar to what current [ORG EU  ] president the [LOC Czech Republic  ] has proposed . 
The most important issue , he said , would be addressing concerns among [LOC Schengen  ] countries . 
[PER Williamson  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] is aware of the complexities of the [LOC Schengen  ] issue and pledges to work with [ORG EU  ] partners as they address these concerns . 
[PER Chevallier  ] said the [ORG GOF  ] was also concerned about recent [ORG USG  ] talks with [LOC Lithuania  ] on detainees ( ref d ) . 
[LOC France  ] , he cautioned , was standing firm on the necessity of an [ORG EU  ] process before implementation of bilateral agreements between the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG EU  ] member states on the matter . 
[PER Williamson  ] noted that recent public pledges by [LOC Lithuania  ] to accept [ORG Guantanamo  ] detainees were the result of almost two years of talks , and that [LOC Lithuania  ] has been firm that implementation of an agreement to accept detainees would occur only after agreement of a common [ORG EU  ] position. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) SUMMARY CONTINUED: [PER Chevallier  ] noted [MISC French  ] concern that former detainees , after being released from [LOC Guantanamo  ] , could return to or become involved in terrorist activities . 
[PER Williamson  ] noted that of the approximately 60 detainees for whom the [LOC U.S.  ] was seeking resettlement all had been previously approved for transfer . 
[PER Chevallier  ] asked if there were any [ORG USG  ] plans to transfer detainees to other parts of the [LOC U.S.  ] without the promise of a swift trial and if the [LOC U.S.  ] was going to accept some of these low-risk detainees . 
[PER Chevallier  ] claimed that the more information [LOC France  ] had regarding these issues the better able it would be to persuade the [MISC French  ] public and other [ORG EU  ] member states by highlighting [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to resettle the detainees . 
[PER Williamson  ] replied that the interagency review process headed by the Attorney General would try to answer these and other questions regarding the detainees . 
[PER Chevallier  ] gave his support to help with future meetings on this issue with the [MISC French  ] ministries of justice and the interior . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( SBU ) S/WCI Ambassador [PER Clint Williamson  ] met on February 16 with [MISC French  ] [ORG MFA  ] advisors to the foreign minister [PER Eric Chevallier  ] and [PER Sylvie Pantz  ] , as well as with [ORG MFA  ] Desk Officer for [ORG Strategic Affairs Camille Petit  ] . 
[PER Charg Mark Pekala  ] , Embassy poloff and [PER Shaun Coughlin  ] ( S/WCI ) also participated . 
Detainees: [MISC French  ] Open to Helping [LOC U.S.  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In response to President [PER Obama  ] 's January 22 Executive Order to close detention facilities at [LOC Guantanamo Bay Naval Base  ] ( ref a ) , [MISC French  ] FM [PER Kouchner  ] publicly gave his support to review the idea of accepting detainees deemed not to be a security risk ( ref b ) . 
S/WCI Ambassador [PER Williamson  ] followed up with advisors to the [MISC French  ] foreign minister on February 16 to seek [ORG GOF  ] cooperation on the resettlement of [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainees . 
[PER Williamson  ] noted that President [PER Obama  ] and Secretary [PER Clinton  ] strongly believe closing the detention center at [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] is a critical foreign policy issue facing the [ORG USG  ] . 
Secretary [PER Clinton  ] asked [PER Williamson  ] to meet with [MISC European  ] partners to explain the [ORG USG  ] position on this matter since the change of administration . 
[PER Williamson  ] thanked [LOC France  ] for its help on this issue , noting that [LOC France  ] has a unique role to play in formulating a process within the [ORG European Union  ] ( [ORG EU  ] ) to accept detainees and helping assuage the concerns of member states that might stymie [ORG EU  ] consensus on the issue. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] spokesman [PER Eric Chevallier  ] reiterated [LOC France  ] 's willingness to assist the [LOC U.S.  ] on this issue ( ref b and c ) , but clarified the [ORG GOF  ] position: detainees would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis ; the detainee had to specifically request resettlement in [LOC France  ] ; and [LOC France  ] would need full information on interested detainees in order to review any security and judicial implications . 
[PER Chevallier  ] said the [ORG GOF  ] was " happy , in principal " that the prison would be closed , but noted that any agreement by [LOC France  ] to accept detainees could not be centered on discussions of " numbers " ( i.e. , [LOC France  ] , and other [ORG EU  ] members , cannot be told they have to accept a specific number of detainees ) . 
[MISC French  ] Stress Importance of [ORG Common EU Position  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Chevallier  ] said the [ORG GOF  ] supports an open [ORG EU  ] process that would allow decisions to be made on a national basis , similar to what the [LOC Czech Republic  ] has been proposing . 
The most important issue , he said , would be addressing concerns among [LOC Schengen  ] countries . 
[PER Williamson  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] was aware of the complexities of the [LOC Schengen  ] issue and pledged to work with [ORG EU  ] partners as they address these concerns . 
[PER Williamson  ] said the [ORG USG  ] was concerned about the potential for any [ORG EU  ] process to drag out , especially by [ORG EU  ] member states that did not want to accept detainees . 
The [ORG USG  ] hopes that [LOC France  ] could play an important role to assuage these concerns . 
[PER Chevallier  ] noted that while there would not be complete consensus within the [ORG EU  ] on whether to accept detainees the [ORG GOF  ] would push other [ORG EU  ] member states to be more open . 
There was room for [ORG EU  ] evolution in a common position , he said . 
[PER Williamson  ] also noted that [ORG EU  ] members [LOC Ireland  ] and [LOC Portugal  ] were wary of an [ORG EU  ] process that did not allow for flexibility , as what happened when both of these countries were directed by the [ORG EU  ] to take [MISC Palestinian  ] militants involved in the 2002 siege of the Church of the [MISC Nativity  ] in [LOC Bethlehem  ] . 
[PER Chevallier  ] said that Church of the [MISC Nativity  ] scenario was unlikely to happen again . 
Rather , a solution such as what the [MISC Czechs  ] were now proposing seemed more likely as it hinged on flexibility. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Chevallier  ] said the [ORG GOF  ] was also concerned about recent [ORG USG  ] talks with [LOC Lithuania  ] on the matter ( ref d ) ; he hoped [PER Williamson  ] could provide him with more details on those discussions . 
Regarding [LOC Lithuania  ] , [PER Williamson  ] noted that recent public statements by that government to accept [ORG Guantanamo  ] detainees were the result of almost two years of talks . 
He said that [LOC Lithuania  ] was interested in accepting some of the [MISC Uzbek  ] detainees because these detainees -- as was deemed by the [ORG GOL  ] -- could best fit into [MISC Lithuanian  ] society due to a common language and the presence of a large [MISC Uzbek  ] population in the country . 
[PER Williamson  ] clarified that the [ORG GOL  ] intended to implement a decision to accept these detainees only once an [ORG EU  ] framework had been agreed on . 
[PER Williamson  ] also explained that the [LOC U.S.  ] would continue to pursue bilateral discussions with interested states as the [ORG EU  ] process progressed . 
He said that it would create inordinate delays if bilateral discussions had to be put on hold until the [ORG EU  ] process was completed , and stressed that this was entirely consistent with the preferred [MISC Czech  ] approach of creating a " permissive [ORG EU  ] environment in which member states could decide to accept detainees . 
" [PER Chevallier  ] agreed that this was a logical way forward . 
Detainees: [MISC French  ] Concerns about Security ----------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Sylvie Pantz  ] said the [ORG GOF  ] was concerned about the reliability of information now available on detainees . 
She said that the [ORG GOF  ] would need as much case information as possible in order to make a proper assessment . 
[PER Pantz  ] noted that recent requests by the [MISC NGO  ] community -- [ORG Reprieve  ] and [ORG Human Rights Watch  ] -- to the [ORG GOF  ] to accept detainees lacked details , which made it difficult to verify claims of abuse and assess security concerns . 
She was hoping the [LOC U.S.  ] could help fill these gaps . 
[PER Williamson  ] noted that a major change within the [PER Obama  ] administration 's approach was moving lead responsibility for detainee status reviews from the [ORG Department of Defense  ] to the [ORG Department of Justice  ] . 
The Attorney General would now lead the interagency process . 
[PER Williamson  ] said the process would ensure that all information pertaining to a detainee was compiled in one place , that fresh reviews of the material would take place in order to determine prosecutability and that renewed threat assessments would be undertaken . 
He said the [ORG USG  ] was happy to facilitate visits to [LOC Guantanamo  ] to interview detainees who might be resettled , as well as share medical and case records . 
So far , he noted , there were 60 low-risk detainees who had been previously approved for transfer and it was unlikely the security assessment for these individuals would be raised , although it was possible. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Pantz  ] and [PER Chevallier  ] asked about recent reports of detainees who , after being released , return to or become involved in terrorist activities . 
[PER Chevallier  ] said there were concerns in [LOC France  ] that detainees determined to be low-risk before entering [ORG Guantanamo  ] could , depending on their experiences in the detention center , pose serious risks to security once released . 
[PER Williamson  ] said that out of the 525 detainees already released , over 500 returned to their home countries . 
Forty to 60 of these individuals were thought to have engaged in some sort of terrorist actions , ranging from minor to larger acts , such as reports of detainees returning to the battlefield in [LOC Iraq  ] or [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
However , he noted , all of these cases had been previously assessed as higher risk , which was very different from the detainees for whom the [LOC U.S.  ] was now seeking to resettle . 
[PER Williamson  ] said threat level assessments were based on the present state of the detainee , taking into account interviews , psychiatric evaluations and other reviews . 
He indicated that the one other case of low-threat detainee resettlements , to [LOC Albania  ] , had gone well and that the eight former detainees had assimilated to varying degrees into life there . 
Further , [LOC France  ] could be assured that the [LOC U.S.  ] would share any security concerns regarding the detainees with its friends and allies . 
[MISC French  ] Questions about [ORG U.S. Plans  ] to [LOC Resettle Detainees  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Chevallier  ] asked if there were any [ORG USG  ] plans to transfer high-risk detainees to the [LOC U.S.  ] without the promise of a swift trial . 
He also asked if the [LOC U.S.  ] was going to accept some of the low-risk detainees . 
[PER Chevallier  ] noted that more information [LOC France  ] had regarding these issues the better able it would be to persuade the [MISC French  ] public and other [ORG EU  ] member states by highlighting [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to find a solution to the detainee issue . 
[PER Williamson  ] replied that the interagency review process would try to answer these and other questions regarding the detainees . 
That aside , he said the [PER Obama  ] administration realizes it would be a bad idea to simply move detainees from one place to another as it would not adequately address the problem . 
[PER Pantz  ] asked whether detainees who could not return home but were seeking to be resettled would simply receive a wish list of potential accepting countries . 
[PER Williamson  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] was looking into options to establish links with potential accepting nations and the detainee , such as what was recently done with the [MISC Uzbeks  ] and [LOC Lithuania  ] , but clarified that the [ORG USG  ] was reluctant to simply ask detainees where they would like to go as it could complicate the resettlement process . 
Future Talks: Offer to Help --------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Chevallier  ] suggested that for future visits [PER Williamson  ] should also speak to representatives from the [MISC French  ] ministries of justice and the interior . 
He said the [ORG MFA  ] would take the lead on setting up these meetings for [PER Williamson  ] , s next visit to [LOC France.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) SWCI [PER Williamson  ] has cleared this message .
