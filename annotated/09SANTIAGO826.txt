REALITY IN CHILE'S [MISC MAPUCHE  ] CONFLICT REF: 08 [ORG SANTIAGO  ] 856 Classified By: A/DCM [PER Laurie Weitzenkorn  ] for reason 1.4 ( B ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary: Despite  ] sensationalist press coverage and a popular image of bloody conflict in [LOC Chile  ] 's southern [MISC Mapuche  ] heartland , poloffs found that relations between indigenous and non-indigenous communities were largely non-violent , if often tense and distrustful . 
Three people -- all [MISC Mapuche  ] activists -- have died in the so-called [MISC Mapuche  ] conflict over the past ten years . 
[LOC Arson  ] , vandalism , and peaceful protests and non-violent activism have been far more common . 
Opposition politicians have alleged links between the [MISC Mapuche  ] and foreign terrorist organizations [ORG FARC  ] and [ORG ETA  ] , but government officials downplay these connections as mere " guerrilla tourism . 
" End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Poloff and [ORG Pol Specialist  ] traveled to the heart of [LOC Chile  ] 's [MISC Mapuche  ] territory , the regions of [LOC Araucania  ] and [PER Los Rios  ] , August 10-14 . 
This trip happened to coincide with the death of a [MISC Mapuche  ] activist , [PER Jaime Mendoza  ] , at the hands of a police officer in a conflict in [LOC Araucania  ] on August 12 , further focusing domestic political attention on [MISC Mapuche  ] unrest . 
This is the first in a series of cables based on meetings with urban and rural [MISC Mapuche  ] community members , government officials , church leaders , academics and civil society members during this trip . 
Septels will describe [MISC Mapuche  ] demands and human rights issues . 
" [LOC Araucania  ] in [MISC Flames  ] " and Other Sensationalism --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A casual observer of [MISC Chilean  ] news coverage could be forgiven for thinking that violent [MISC Mapuche  ] activists with strong and active links to the [ORG FARC  ] and [ORG ETA  ] are killing innocent civilians each week in the so-called " [MISC Mapuche  ] conflict . 
" Opposition presidential candidate [PER Sebastian Pinera  ] has declared that " [LOC Araucania  ] is in flames . 
" [LOC Chile  ] 's major newspapers , which are generally conservative in their political outlook , frequently run reports of conflict related to indigenous concerns prominently on the front page . 
Destruction of property -- which accounts for the vast majority of all illegal [MISC Mapuche  ] action -- is often displayed in full color and with bold headlines , sometimes beating out coverage of more severe crimes committed by non-indigenous [MISC Chileans  ] . 
Moreover , positive or less incendiary news from indigenous communities -- resolution of localized conflicts , peaceful protests , meetings , or other actions taken to address [MISC Mapuche  ] political concerns -- are often not covered at all . 
Conflicts Over [LOC Ancestral Lands  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Unsurprisingly , conflicts over ancestral lands are the most frequent flash point for clashes . 
The [MISC Chilean  ] government 's colonization policy of the late 1800s , known as the " Pacification of the [LOC Araucania  ] , " led to the first real conquest of [MISC Mapuche  ] territory , which had never been under [MISC Spanish  ] control . 
Mapuches were pushed off the best agricultural lands , which the [MISC Chilean  ] government auctioned off . 
Land reforms in the 1960s and 70s benefited [MISC Mapuche  ] communities as well as other landless farmers , but were largely rolled back under [MISC Pinochet  ] . 
Preparation for the return to democracy led to a new deal between then candidate [PER Patricio Aylwin  ] and indigenous communities in 1989 . 
[PER Aylwin  ] 's victory was followed by a new indigenous law in 1993 that included mechanisms for transferring indigenous land back to indigenous communities . 
However , the ensuing 16 years have brought slow progress on land acquisitions and transfers , contributing to a [MISC Mapuche  ] vision of 100 years of broken promises from the [MISC Chilean  ] state . 
Social Protest or Domestic Terrorism ? ------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In contrast to the sensationalist news coverage , the reality of relations between the indigenous [MISC Mapuche  ] community , their non-indigenous neighbors , and the [MISC Chilean  ] state is complex and sometimes contentious , but overwhelmingly non-violent . 
While the [MISC Chilean  ] public associates Mapuches with rural areas of [LOC Araucania  ] and neighboring regions , 70% of [MISC Mapuche  ] live in urban areas . 
[LOC Santiago  ] is home to more Mapuches than any other region . 
Confrontations between Mapuches and others in [LOC Santiago  ] are rare , and many Mapuches go about their daily lives without highlighting their ethnic background . 
Outside of [ORG Santiago SANTIAGO  ] 00000826 002 OF 003 many [MISC Mapuche  ] communities have peaceful but tense relations with their neighbors and the [MISC Chilean  ] government . 
Frustration and distrust are common , particularly in rural communities in the regions of [LOC Bio Bio  ] , [LOC Araucania  ] , and [PER Los Rios  ] . 
Some communities are engaged in non-violent activism. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to Interior Under Secretary [PER Patricio Rosende  ] , 27 of [LOC Chile  ] 's 2,100 [MISC Mapuche  ] communities are actively in conflict with landowners or the [MISC Chilean  ] government . 
Eight of those 27 conflicts have turned violent . 
Since 1990 , when the [MISC Mapuche  ] community began pressing the newly democratic state for more rights and restitution of ancestral lands , three people have died as a direct result of the [MISC Mapuche  ] conflict . 
All of the deaths have been young [MISC Mapuche  ] activists killed by [MISC Chilean  ] police: [PER Alex Lemun  ] , a 17-year old killed in 2002 ; [PER Matrias Catrileo  ] , a 23-year old killed in January 2008 ; and [PER Jaime Mendoza  ] , a 24-year old killed on August 12 , 2009. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While violence targeting people remains rare , vandalism and destruction of property are more common techniques used by communities in conflict . 
A single piece of land , owned by [PER Rene Urban  ] but claimed by [MISC Mapuche  ] communities , has been occupied by [MISC Mapuche  ] activists 62 times , and has been subject to arson and other forms of property destruction . 
Frequent attacks against property and investment projects contribute to the lack of economic development in the zone . 
[LOC Araucania  ] has the highest poverty and unemployment rates in the nation . 
The president of the [ORG Temuco Agricultural Promotion Society  ] recently told the press , " No one in his right mind would invest today in [LOC Araucania  ] . 
" " [MISC Guerrilla Tourism  ] " or Expanding Terrorist Networks ? : Alleged Links to [ORG FARC  ] and [ORG ETA  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) In meetings with Poloff August 24 and 20 , both [PER Rosende  ] and National Prosecutor 's [ORG Office International Affairs  ] Director [PER Jorge Chocair  ] played down allegations of ties between Mapuches -- particularly the often violent group [ORG Coordinadora Arauco Malleco  ] ( [ORG CAM  ] ) -- and foreign terrorist organizations like the [ORG FARC  ] or [ORG ETA  ] . 
Yes , some [ORG CAM  ] members have traveled to [LOC Colombia  ] , [LOC Spain  ] , and southern [LOC Mexico  ] , and may have even participated in some training camps run by these foreign organizations , they said . 
A handful of representatives from [LOC Askapena  ] , [ORG ETA  ] 's political arm , visited [MISC Mapuche  ] communities in August 2009 . 
However , [PER Rosende  ] and [PER Chocair  ] both characterized these relationships as relatively casual and infrequent , with [PER Chocair  ] describing it as " guerrilla tourism: " traveling to rebel-held areas of a third country for photos and meetings with little follow up. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Rosende  ] and [PER Chocair  ] both claim that the [ORG CAM  ] barely exists now , thanks to a number of high-profile arrests of alleged [ORG CAM  ] leaders . 
( Note: A September 1 press report alleges that the [ORG CAM  ] is recruiting urban Mapuches to assume leadership roles in the organization . 
End note . 
) [PER Jaime Lopez  ] , an [MISC Araucania-based  ] public defender specializing in [MISC Mapuche  ] defendants , expressed his doubts to [LOC Poloffs  ] on August 11 that the [ORG CAM  ] was ever a terrorist organization , noting that three successive court cases failed to demonstrate that they had organized any terrorist activity. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In contrast to these views from administration officials , opposition leaders -- including presidential candidate [PER Sebastian Pinera  ] -- have sought to emphasize the connections between the [MISC Mapuche  ] and terrorist organizations . 
During an August 19 meeting with [LOC Poloffs  ] , Senator [PER Alberto Espina  ] stated that the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] has evidence of [ORG FARC  ] links to [LOC Chile  ] , including dates and routes of travel for 8-10 [MISC Mapuche  ] individuals who attended [ORG FARC  ] training camps . 
( Note: Reftel describes [PER Pinera  ] and [PER Espina  ] 's role in publicizing a May 2008 [MISC Colombian  ] intelligence report alleging links between [ORG FARC  ] rebels and [MISC Chilean  ] communists , [MISC Mapuche  ] activists , and others in [LOC Chile  ] . 
End note . 
) <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) COMMENT: Disagreements between the [MISC Mapuche  ] community , non-Mapuche landowners , and the [MISC Chilean  ] state are serious and merit attention . 
At a minimum , such conflict traps indigenous and non-indigenous community members alike in a cycle of distrust , hindering economic development in the region and preventing the full inclusion of Mapuches in [MISC Chilean  ] society . 
However , even with the most recent death of a young [MISC Mapuche  ] activist , the large-scale violent unrest that many [MISC Chileans  ] project on the region is overblown . 
Similarly , despite vocal allegations in the press , the opposition has [ORG SANTIAGO  ] 00000826 003 OF 003 yet to produce credible evidence that there is significant and on-going cooperation between the [MISC Mapuche  ] community and [ORG FARC  ] and [ORG ETA  ] terrorists . 
END COMMENT .
