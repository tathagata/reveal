Blake  ] , Jr. , for reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) SUMMARY: Allegations of government complicity in crimes committed by organized paramilitary groups have mounted in the last year . 
Paramilitaries such as the [ORG Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam  ] ( [ORG LTTE  ] ) -breakaway [ORG Karuna  ] group [ORG and Eelam People’s Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG EPDP  ] ) have helped the Government of [LOC Sri Lanka  ] ( [ORG GSL  ] ) to fight the [ORG LTTE  ] , to kidnap suspected [ORG LTTE  ] collaborators , and to give the [ORG GSL  ] a measure of deniability . 
The [ORG GSL  ] , which denies any links to paramilitary groups , has recently touted its efforts to improve its human rights record , such as the re-publication of procedures on arrests and detentions and the appointment of a “One-Man Commission” to investigate reported disappearances ( ref C ) . 
However , these efforts so far appear aimed more at improving [MISC Sri Lanka’s  ] image abroad and have yet to produce concrete improvements in the human rights situation . 
Outside the capital , the incidence of human rights abuses has continued , including extrajudicial killings , abductions , child trafficking , extortion , and prostitution . 
President Rajapaksa’s government , strapped for cash , has cut direct payments to paramilitaries initiated by former President [PER Kumaratunga  ] and instead turns a blind eye to extortion and kidnapping for ransom by [ORG EPDP  ] and [ORG Karuna  ] . 
While many of the charges against the government have been made in public fora , a growing number of trusted Embassy contacts , often at personal risk , have described in detail the extent of the [MISC GSL’s  ] involvement with paramilitary groups . 
END SUMMARY . 
[ORG GSL  ] Finds Paramilitaries Useful ------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG GSL  ] sees several advantages in allowing paramilitary groups to operate in the country . 
Paramilitary groups in the [LOC North  ] and [LOC East  ] help the [ORG GSL  ] fight the [ORG LTTE  ] and compete with the [ORG LTTE  ] for public support and new recruits . 
These groups also enhance security in [LOC Colombo  ] by kidnapping and sometimes killing those suspected of working with the [ORG LTTE  ] . 
Frequent abductions by paramilitaries keep critics of the [ORG GSL  ] fearful and quiet . 
Ultimately , the [MISC GSL’s  ] objective is to turn [ORG Karuna  ] and [ORG EPDP  ] leader [PER Douglas Devananda  ] into pro-GSL political leaders in the [LOC East  ] and [LOC North  ] , respectively . 
The government hopes this will ensure long term control over these areas even if some form of devolution is instituted. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In the meantime , these paramilitary groups give the [ORG GSL  ] a measure of deniability . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that some military commanders in JaffnaXXXXXXXXXXXX want to clamp down on paramilitaries but have orders from [ORG Defense Secretary Gothabaya  ] [PER Rajapaksa  ] to not interfere with the paramilitaries on the grounds that they are doing “work” that the military cannot do because of international scrutiny . 
On [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] confided to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] had instructed him not to interfere with “military intelligence” operations ( ref E ) . 
[LOC COLOMBO  ] 00000728 002 OF 006 <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG GSL  ] has a history of funding paramilitary groups . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] pointed out that under former President [PER Kumaratunga  ] , the [ORG GSL  ] had begun the practice of paying paramilitaries to refrain from engaging in criminal pursuits . 
Several Embassy interlocutors have independently confirmed this . 
However , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the current government , cash-strapped , has ended this arrangement . 
Instead , he alleged , [ORG Defense Secretary  ] [PER Gothabaya Rajapaksa  ] has authorized [ORG EPDP  ] and [ORG Karuna  ] to collect the money from [MISC Tamil  ] businessmen . 
This may account for the sharp rise in lawlessness , especially extortion and kidnapping , that many have documented in [LOC Vavuniya  ] and [LOC Colombo  ] . 
Even though [ORG EPDP  ] and [ORG Karuna  ] are each comprised nearly exclusively of ethnic [MISC Tamils  ] , the crimes that they commit are almost always against other [MISC Tamils  ] . 
[PER Karuna Group  ] Becomes Pre-eminent Paramilitary --------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [PER Karuna  ] faction’s formal name is [MISC Tamil  ] Makkal [PER Viduthalai Pulikal  ] ( [ORG TMVP  ] ) , which means “Liberation Tigers of the [MISC Tamil  ] People” in [MISC Tamil  ] . 
This name is an attempt to sap legitimacy from the [ORG LTTE  ] by taking the “Liberation [MISC Tigers”  ] part of their name . 
In less than one year since [PER Karuna  ] returned to [LOC Sri Lanka  ] , the [ORG TMVP  ] has become the most powerful paramilitary organization in the country . 
It began in 2004 when [PER Karuna  ] broke away from the [ORG LTTE  ] , taking about 4,000 [ORG Tiger  ] cadres with him ( ref H ) . 
After the [ORG LTTE  ] struck back , inflicting serious losses , then-President [PER Chandrika Kumaratunga  ] helped [PER Karuna  ] escape to the [MISC Indian  ] state of [LOC Tamil Nadu  ] , where he remained until July 2006 . 
He remained active in managing his cadres even while living abroad . 
Since returning to [LOC Sri Lanka  ] , [PER Karuna  ] has used strong-arm tactics to establish a powerful paramilitary group that operates under government protection ( ref D ) . 
Abductions and Killings ----------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG Karuna  ] group is probably the most active [MISC Sri Lankan  ] paramilitary in abductions and extrajudicial killings . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] confided to [PER PolOff  ] that even MPs fear that the [ORG GSL  ] will use [PER Karuna  ] to assassinate them . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] echoed this anxiety to us [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
A number of [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] MPs , [MISC Muslims  ] as well as [MISC Tamils  ] , have told us privately that they fear for their lives . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that he believed [ORG Karuna  ] set up the assassination of [MISC Tamil  ] MP [PER Joseph Pararajasingham  ] on [ORG Christmas Day  ] 2005 ( ref G ) with the help of [ORG EPDP  ] leader [PER Devananda  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was also positive that [PER Karuna  ] cadres were employed in the killing in [LOC Colombo  ] of popular [MISC Tamil  ] MP [PER Nadarajah Raviraj  ] on November 10 , 2006 ( ref F ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] confirmed that [ORG Karuna  ] has extended his activities to [LOC Jaffna  ] from his base in the [LOC East  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] has documented [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] abduction cases in [LOC Jaffna  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , many of which he believes are the responsibility of the [ORG Karuna  ] group . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [PER PolOff  ] that he was discouraged [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us he has [LOC COLOMBO  ] 00000728 003 OF 006 evidence of [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
However , because of [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and limited resources , he was only able to document a sample [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] described one abduction in which a man suspected of having ties to the [ORG LTTE  ] was taken and a “calling card” was left with a picture of [PER Karuna  ] on the front and a calendar on the back , indicating that the man’s “time had run out.” Child Soldiers -------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG TMVP  ] is allowed to operate throughout the [LOC East  ] in close proximity to [ORG SLA  ] bases , often with clearly underage cadres guarding its camps with machine guns . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that the [ORG GSL  ] allows Karuna’s cadres to recruit children forcibly from within [ORG IDP  ] camps in the [LOC East  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the average age of [ORG Karuna  ] recruits is 14 . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX’s allegation that [ORG Karuna  ] recruits children from [ORG IDP  ] camps with the tacit approval of the military was confirmed by [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
We have received confidential reports of the [ORG Karuna  ] group’s recruitment and use of child soldiers from a [MISC U.S.-based  ] [ORG NGO  ] as well . 
Extortion and [ORG Prostitution Rings  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG Karuna  ] does not have the international fund-raising network among the [MISC Tamil  ] [ORG Diaspora  ] that the [ORG LTTE  ] has built over the past 25 years . 
As a result , he has resorted to a wide range of criminal activities . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that when the [ORG GSL  ] brings in shipments of food and supplies to [ORG IDP  ] camps from [LOC Colombo  ] , Karuna’s cadres are given the opportunity to go through the shipment first . 
They are allowed to take any food they need for themselves , as well as any supplies they believe they can sell , with only the left-overs making their way to the [LOC IDPs.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also explained that [ORG Karuna  ] operates prostitution rings out of the [ORG IDP  ] camps to “take care of” [ORG GSL  ] soldiers , stating that the women “had no choice” but to acquiesce to [PER Karuna  ] cadres’ demands . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] independently described how women are forced into prostitution , or to give up their children to traffickers . 
The methods are similar to those in [LOC Jaffna  ] ( paras 17-18 ) . 
Families sometimes try to arrange their daughters’ marriages at the age of 12 or 13 in the hope that it will reduce the likelihood of their being forced into prostitution. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Although the [ORG GSL  ] has consistently denied supporting [PER Karuna  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] allowed [PER PolOff  ] to listen to tapes of his interview with [ORG Gothabaya  ] . 
The [ORG Defense Secretary  ] was effusive in his praise for [PER Karuna  ] and the [PER SIPDIS  ] benefits the [ORG GSLXXXXXXXXXXXX COLOMBO  ] 00000728 004 OF 006 Making [PER Karuna Legitimate  ] ------------------------ <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] The [ORG TMVP  ] does not yet have the status of a formal political party . 
According to [MISC Sri Lanka’s  ] Constitution , new parties cannot register when an election is “pending” in any part of the country . 
Elections for local councils are long overdue in the [MISC Northern  ] and [ORG Eastern Provinces  ] , which are now in constitutional limbo following the October 1 , 2006 [ORG Supreme Court  ] decision to de-merge the two provinces . 
As a result , the [ORG GSL  ] must find an existing political party for [PER Karuna  ] to “join , ” perhaps later changing the name to [ORG TMVP  ] , in order for [PER Karuna  ] to stand for elections . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said thatXXXXXXXXXXXX has so far resisted [ORG GSL  ] efforts to force a shotgun marriage with [PER Karuna  ] , but that he may ultimately have to yield . 
EPDP: “Political [MISC Party”  ] and Paramilitary ----------------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG EPDP  ] , originally called the [ORG Eelam People’s Revolutionary Liberation Front  ] ( [ORG EPRLF  ] ) , began as a rival to the [ORG LTTE  ] . 
One wing of the [ORG EPRLF  ] founded the [ORG EPDP  ] as a formal political party when its leader , [PER Douglas Devananda  ] , was elected to Parliament in 1994 and aligned with the government . 
[PER Devananda  ] continues to hold the single parliamentary seat his party won in the 2004 election . 
As part of the ruling coalition , he serves as Minister of [ORG Social Services  ] and [ORG Social Welfare  ] . 
Although registered as a formal political party , the [ORG EPDP  ] remains a feared paramilitary group , wielding non-official power over parts of the [LOC Jaffna  ] peninsula and especially the offshore islands with the tacit approval of the [LOC Sri Lanka  ] Army . 
Extra-Judicial Killings with the [ORG Military’s Support  ] --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Working in concert with [ORG SLA  ] soldiers stationed in the [LOC Jaffna  ] peninsula , the [ORG EPDP  ] is able to conduct extortion , abductions , extra-judicial killings and other criminal acts without fear of consequences , according to numerous sources . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us about EPDP’s involvement in extra-judicial killings in [LOC Jaffna  ] . 
Independently , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] confirmed much of XXXXXXXXXXXX’s account . 
He explained that when the [ORG EPDP  ] intends to kill a target , they first provide notice to the military . 
The number of soldiers patrolling the streets of [LOC Jaffna  ] ( 40,000 total on the peninsula ) is such that there are literally soldiers stationed at every street corner . 
At an agreed time , all of the soldiers in the designated area take a five to ten minute “break” at once ( although the normal practice is to take breaks in shifts ) . 
At that point , armed and masked gunmen , often riding on motorcycles , race down the street and assassinate the intended victim . 
Shortly after the killing , the soldiers’ break over , they return to their posts to deal with the aftermath . 
While police investigations are common , they almost never lead to arrests . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also told us of a [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] doctor [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] who performs forced abortions , often under the guise of a regular check-up , on [MISC Tamil  ] women suspected of being aligned with the [ORG LTTE  ] . 
[ORG COLOMBO  ] 00000728 005 OF 006 <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] Child Trafficking ----------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he believes that [ORG EPDP  ] is operating child trafficking rings in [LOC Jaffna  ] with a base on [LOC Delft  ] island , which the [ORG EPDP  ] “owns.” [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained that because of the large number of widows in [LOC Jaffna  ] , men associated with the [ORG EPDP  ] , often from neighboring villages , are used to seduce women with children , especially girls , with the promise of economic protection . 
After establishing a relationship , the men then take the children , sometimes by force and sometimes with the promise that they will be provided a better life . 
The children are sold into slavery , usually boys to work camps and girls to prostitution rings , through EPDP’s networks in [LOC India  ] and [LOC Malaysia  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] maintains that children are often smuggled out of the country with the help of a corrupt Customs and Immigration official at [LOC Bandaranaike International Airport  ] in [LOC Colombo.  ] <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) XXXXXXXXXXXX’s story was partially verified by [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] who stated that the [ORG EPDP  ] works in concert with the [LOC Sri Lanka  ] Army ( [ORG SLA  ] ) to operate [MISC Tamil  ] prostitution rings for the soldiers . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that young women were taken and forced to have sex with between five and ten soldiers a night . 
Sometimes they are paid approximately a dollar for each “service.” The young women’s parents are unable to complain to authorities for fear of retribution and because doing so would ruin the girls’ reputation , making it impossible for them ever to marry . 
Families have begun arranging marriages for their daughters at a very young age in the hopes that the [ORG EPDP  ] and soldiers will be less likely to take them . 
In addition to trafficking in children , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] detailed how the [ORG EPDP  ] operates an illicit alcohol smuggling ring using child “mules.” [LOC U.S.  ] Takes a [ORG Hard Line  ] against [ORG Paramilitaries  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Addressing the activities of these paramilitaries and their blatant disregard for human rights is a top priority of the Embassy . 
Ambassador , [ORG DCM  ] and Pol Chief have met repeatedly with the President , the Foreign Minister , Foreign Secretary , [ORG Defense Secretary  ] [PER Gothabaya Rajapaksa  ] , Human Rights Minister [PER Mahinda Samarasinghe  ] and others to emphasize the importance of reining in these groups and ending the abductions , killings , and other human rights abuses . 
Visiting senior [ORG USG  ] officials , including Assistant Secretary for [LOC South  ] and [ORG Central Asian Affairs  ] ( [ORG SCA  ] ) Richard [PER SIPDIS Boucher  ] and Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for [ORG SCA  ] [PER Steven Mann  ] have delivered tough messages on human rights to the highest levels of the [ORG GSL  ] , noting that continued abuses could affect defense cooperation . 
[ORG COLOMBO  ] 00000728 006 OF 006 <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) COMMENT: While none of the evidence put forward by our contacts constitutes a smoking gun , the preponderance of these statements ) and the extent to which they independently corroborate each other ) points to a pattern of [ORG GSL  ] complicity with paramilitary groups on multiple levels . 
It appears that this involvement goes beyond merely turning a blind eye to these organizations’ less savory activities . 
At worst , these accounts suggest that top leaders of its security establishment may be providing direction to these paramilitaries . 
While it is perhaps understandable that the [ORG GSL  ] wants to use every possible means in its war against [ORG LTTE  ] terror , we must continue to stress to the Government the importance of reining in the paramilitaries and establishing internationally accepted norms for arresting , investigating , prosecuting and , if appropriate , punishing those suspected of cooperating with the [ORG LTTE  ] .
