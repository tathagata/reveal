[LOC TRIPOLI  ] 34 B. 07 [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 759 CLASSIFIED BY: [PER Gene A. Cretz  ] , Ambassador , [LOC US  ] Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] , [ORG Department of State  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: [ORG UN  ] officials recently completed a series of five meetings with prominent quasi-nongovernmental organizations in [LOC Tripoli  ] focused on raising awareness of basic human and civil rights while building capacity for the organizations . 
The organizations , all chaired by people close to the al-Qadhafi inner circle , have been key proponents of [LOC Libya  ] 's fitful politico-economic reform program . 
The organizations owe their existence to al-Qadhafi and are constrained by his " red lines " , but some [MISC NGO-led  ] attempts at fostering reform have met with failure due to lack of institutional expertise and capacity . 
[ORG UN  ] officials see the successful completion of the series as an outcome in itself . 
They reported that participants concluded that awareness of human and civil rights was nearly non-existent in [LOC Libya  ] and , critically , that the organizations had no government counterpart with whom to implement improvements . 
The nine-month contact group is unlikely to develop further in the short term: the [ORG UN  ] is losing its two prime interlocutors to new postings and the role of [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi -- a key enabler of civil society organizations -- is less certain than when the group formed in September 2008 . 
End Summary . 
CHARITY ORGANIZATIONS DOMINATED BY REGIME INSIDERS 2 . 
( C ) xxxxxxxxxxxx Charity groups -- the regime-approved nomenclature for NGOs -- require direct approval by the Prime Minister-equivalent to form . 
As such , they are led by people close to the al-Qadhafi inner circle: al-Qadhafi 's son [PER Saif  ] al-Islam chairs the [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] ; [PER Aisha al-Qadhafi  ] , the Leader 's daughter , chairs the [ORG Waatesimu Foundation  ] ; [PER Mohammad Kusa  ] , brother of Foreign Minister [PER Musa Kusa  ] , runs the [ORG Organization of Youth for Voluntary Works  ] ; and Khaled al-Humeidi , director of the [ORG International Organization for Peace  ] , Care , and Relief , serves as a personal aide to al-Qadhafi and is reportedly close with both [PER Saif  ] and [PER Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi . 
These groups were joined by [PER Hosni  ] al-Waheish from the General People 's [ORG Congress' Human Rights Committee  ] and representatives from the [MISC World Islamic Call Society  ] at the roundtable discussions that were held quietly without press or diplomatic observers . 
3 . 
( C ) xxxxxxxxxxxx reported that all members of the group agreed that implementing human rights programming and dialogue between the [ORG GOL  ] and actors like the [LOC US  ] and [ORG EU  ] would be hampered in the short term by a general lack of awareness of human rights issues by both [ORG GOL  ] officials and the [MISC Libyan  ] public . 
Representatives reportedly complained that several initiatives had been stalled by a lack of government interlocutors to establish modalities for implementing humanitarian and reform programs . 
According to xxxxxxxxxxxx , the groups' closeness to the regime affords them more space to carry out " benign " programs and provides the government assurance that so-called " red lines " outlined in ref B -- [MISC Islamic  ] traditions , [LOC Libya  ] 's security and stability , territorial integrity , and the primacy [MISC Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi -- are not threatened . 
4 . 
( C ) According to xxxxxxxxxxxx , organizing the group and developing the high-level contacts through sustained dialogue is seen as a successful outcome in itself . 
However , other goals such as delineating areas of responsibility between different charity groups and normalizing interaction between international non-governmental organizations and the [ORG GOL  ] remain outstanding . 
While the [ORG UN  ] hopes to continue the dialogue , xxxxxxxxxxxx recognized that their measured success had been based on the personal relationships that xxxxxxxxxxxx had leveraged to begin the conversation. xxxxxxxxxxxx He predicted that [LOC Libya  ] would frustrate [MISC Western  ] interlocutors because [LOC Libya  ] is only prepared to engage at the symbolic level but noted that passing symbolic milestones before attempting broader talks was a necessary exercise with [MISC Libyan  ] officials . 
5 . 
( C ) Comment: xxxxxxxxxxxx were able to develop excellent contacts within [LOC Libya  ] 's small but growing civil society community in part due to their organizational affiliation . 
The [ORG UN  ] is viewed by the [ORG GOL  ] as less threatening than bilateral engagement and is able to build relationships by implementing programs with the proto-NGOs as side-by-side [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000602 002 OF 002 partnerships vice the contracted partner model [MISC Western  ] governments prefer . 
Their limited success , however , is more evidence that some dissention remains between hard-line regime members and more reform-minded actors as to how open [LOC Libya  ] should be with the [LOC West  ] , particularly in sensitive issues like political reform and human rights . 
With xxxxxxxxxxxx departing post , the [ORG UN  ] is left without leaders with political saavy and understanding of the strictures of the [LOC Jamahiriya  ] and will likely see a slowing of direct engagement on human rights .
