( C/NF ) Dan , welcome back to [LOC Spain  ] . 
I appreciate your patience and efforts to finally resolve the [MISC NCIS/OSI  ] issue and I 'm glad that you 've made this [ORG High-Level Defense Committee  ] ( [ORG HLDC  ] ) meeting a priority . 
Now that the [ORG Permanent Committee  ] is back on track , handling routine issues at the staff level , we can use the [ORG HLDC  ] forum to share views and set strategic direction on key international policy issues like [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Kosovo  ] , the [MISC Couso  ] case , missile defense , the [ORG NATO  ] Summit in 2008 , and future [LOC US  ] use of [LOC Moron  ] and [LOC Rota  ] military bases . 
As we 've discussed before , [LOC Spain  ] can at times be a difficult partner , but never more so than when it feels ignored . 
This meeting , along with Secretary [PER Rice  ] 's visit in a few weeks , should reassure the [ORG GOS  ] that we take it seriously , but while reminding [ORG MOD  ] that we have high expectations of such important partners . 
-- [LOC US  ] USE OF [MISC SPANISH  ] BASES -- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) The [ORG DCM  ] , the [ORG Embassy  ] 's political-military team , and I travel regularly to [LOC Rota  ] and [LOC Moron  ] , the [MISC Spanish  ] bases where nearly 3000 [LOC US  ] troops and dependents live and work . 
With each successive visit , I am more impressed by the important activities and outstanding working-level cooperation at the bases . 
The [MISC Czech  ] Deputy Prime Minister , planning for the possibility of [LOC US  ] missile defense installations in his country , recently visited [LOC Rota  ] in order to understand how the [LOC US  ] military behaves as a tenant . 
Perhaps on your next trip you'll be able to travel to southern [LOC Spain  ] to get a better idea of the key role that the bases play in [LOC US  ] efforts in [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and other operations . 
As you know , it is taking [ORG MOD  ] longer than we expected to implement its new interagency process for reviewing proposed [ORG Naval Criminal Investigative Service  ] and [ORG USAF Office of Special Investigations  ] activities . 
We continue to press them to speed the process so that we can begin to implement the agreement and our investigators can get back to work . 
-- [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] -- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) Despite the limitations imposed by [MISC Spanish  ] domestic politics , which are foremost in every minister 's mind , due to nationwide local/regional elections in two weeks and national elections within the year , [LOC Spain  ] remains a stalwart ally in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Though not currently in a position to increase the 690-soldier troop ceiling that Parliament set , the [ORG GOS  ] insists that it is committed to maintain current levels for the long haul . 
Your primary interlocutor , [ORG MOD  ] Secretary General for Policy [PER Luis Cuesta  ] , recently spent a week in [LOC Kabul  ] and [LOC Herat  ] with his counterpart from [ORG MFA  ] . 
They both returned relatively optimistic that [ORG NATO-ISAF  ] is making progress but understanding more clearly than ever that [ORG NATO  ] won't be able to leave anytime soon . 
Top [ORG MOD  ] leaders have also told us privately that CHOD General [PER Sanz  ] has initiated discussions in [LOC Brussels  ] regarding the possibility that [LOC Spain  ] would staff the core of the [ORG ISAF HQ  ] in summer 2008 , after [MISC Spanish  ] elections . 
We continue to press the [ORG GOS  ] to increase its public diplomacy efforts , and to consider doing more when it is able. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) While the [ORG GOS  ] has lately complained about the lack of coordination between [ORG ISAF  ] and [ORG Operation Enduring Freedom  ] -- specifically the airstrikes in [LOC Herat  ] province that killed civilians as well as [PER Taliban  ] -- [LOC Spain  ] remains active on the security and reconstruction fronts . 
The [ORG Spanish Provincial Reconstruction Team  ] ( PRT ) is well regarded for involving local [MISC Afghanis  ] in its efforts to provide basic services and critical infrastructure to the people of [LOC Badghis  ] province , but [ORG MFA  ] officials note that there is no sign of the central government or national security forces in the province . 
While carefully complying with its caveat , [MISC Spanish  ] troops supported [ORG NATO-ISAF  ] 's [MISC Operation Achilles  ] earlier this spring by sealing the southern border of their zone . 
Regarding its [ORG Sevilla Ministerial  ] commitments , [ORG MOD  ] sources say that two [MISC Spanish  ] military training teams ( OMLTs ) will arrive in [LOC Afghanistan  ] in early June to begin training [ORG Afghan National Army  ] troops . 
They have told us that that these 30-50 soldiers will be in addition to the 690 troops that are already deployed . 
The [ORG Spanish Army  ] is also proceeding with its purchase of tactical UAVs , and expects to have them in the field later this year . 
-- [LOC KOSOVO  ] -- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) In the [LOC Balkans  ] , where its troops have served for more than 15 years , [LOC Spain  ] has shown its ability to maintain troops for the long-term . 
Right now , however , we need keep [ORG MADRID  ] 00000911 002 OF 003 making our case to keep troops in [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
For domestic political reasons and fear of provoking [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Spain  ] is ambivalent about the current direction of [LOC Kosovo  ] policy . 
So long as there is a [ORG UN  ] resolution authorizing the [MISC Ahtissari  ] plan , [LOC Spain  ] will maintain its troops in [LOC KFOR  ] . 
If the [ORG UN  ] fails to agree on a new resolution , [LOC Spain  ] has said that it would have to seriously consider pulling its troops out , but has emphasized that it would do this only in extremis and only in careful consultation with allies . 
We need to keep the pressure on , reminding [LOC Spain  ] that [ORG NATO  ] has a critical role and that we can't let the [MISC Russians  ] drive a wedge between the [LOC US  ] and [LOC Europe  ] on issues like this . 
-- [ORG MISSILE DEFENSE  ] -- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) Though initially tentative about the [LOC US  ] missile defense ( [LOC MD  ] ) plan , [LOC Spain  ] listened carefully to the [ORG Missile Defense Agency  ] Deputy Director [PER BG O'Reilly  ] 's presentation in March , asked some tough questions , and has taken the position that so long as the [LOC US  ] attends to [MISC Russian  ] and is willing to discuss the issue in [ORG NATO  ] , it won't stand in the way . 
[ORG MOD  ] said that it will soon announce support for the development of a [ORG NATO  ] study on the issue . 
[ORG MOD  ] has asked to see a simulation of how well the proposed [LOC MD  ] system would cover [LOC Spain  ] , though it says that it doesn't currently see a particular threat from [LOC Iran  ] and is willing to support the [LOC US  ] 's plan primarily as a show of solidarity among allies . 
While we need to continue to inform and engage [ORG MOD  ] on this issue , we don't see [LOC Spain  ] causing problems on missile defense . 
-- [ORG NATO  ] -- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) On 2008 [ORG NATO  ] Summit issues of enlargement and partnership , [LOC Spain  ] believes that [ORG NATO  ] should keep an open door to [MISC European  ] applicants who can qualify . 
[ORG MOD  ] says that the [LOC Balkans  ] should be treated as a single unit , despite their different stages of development , because it will be important to future [LOC Balkans  ] stability to eventually get them all around the [ORG NATO  ] table . 
Regarding [LOC Ukraine  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] , [LOC Spain  ] is not opposed to the idea that they would eventually join [ORG NATO  ] , but says that the best thing at the moment is to wait and see what direction they choose to go . 
[LOC Spain  ] is a big fan of [ORG NATO  ] partnerships , especially the [ORG Mediterranean Dialogue  ] , which it believes should be strengthened for the sake of fighting terrorism in [LOC North Africa  ] and supporting the current governments and militaries against extremists . 
[ORG MOD  ] says that the [ORG Med Dialogue  ] countries know that they aren't going to someday join [ORG NATO  ] , but that they should be invited to observe exercises , included in training , and given other opportunities to deepen ties and cooperate with [ORG NATO  ] . 
-- CRITICAL SIDEBAR ISSUES -- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) A couple of other key issues will be in the air , if not actually on the agenda . 
For our side , it will be important to continue to raise the [PER Couso  ] case , in which three [LOC US  ] servicemen face charges related to the 2003 death of [MISC Spanish  ] cameraman [PER Jose Couso  ] during the battle for [LOC Baghdad  ] . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX . 
I raised this issue with Vice President de [PER la Vega  ] on April 30 . 
She was supportive but uncertain that direct [ORG GOS  ] involvement would be productive . 
[ORG DCM  ] spoke late last week with the Deputy Justice Minister , and we continue to prod the [ORG GOS  ] to appeal . 
We were informed Monday morning that the Chief Prosecutor of [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG National Court  ] has indeed filed an appeal , which will go to the same court which originally dismissed the case ( in 2006 ) on procedural grounds . 
The Deputy DIGENPOL in [ORG MOD  ] told the [MISC Embassy  ] last week that [ORG MOD  ] completely supports the [LOC US  ] position , and said that he would raise with his superiors the possibility of making a statement to the court or otherwise demonstrating support . 
The Deputy Justice Minister also said the [ORG GOS  ] strongly opposes a case brought against former Secretary [PER Rumsfeld  ] and will work to get it dismissed . 
The [MISC SIPDIS  ] judge involved in that case has told us he has already started the process of dismissing the case. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) An issue that [ORG MOD  ] may raise with you is their perception of " imbalance " in the defense industrial relationship . 
The [ORG HLDC  ] is not the most appropriate forum for a discussion of this issue , especially since [PER Al Volkman  ] , Director of [ORG International Cooperation  ] for acquisitions , will be in [LOC Madrid  ] at the same time as you precisely for the long-scheduled 17th [ORG US-Spain Defense Industrial Cooperation Committee  ] meeting and the 4th [ORG US-Spain Declaration of MADRID  ] 00000911 003 OF 003 Principles meeting . 
Nonetheless , [ORG Spanish Defense Ministry  ] officials have seen you with Secretary [PER Gates  ] , and may raise the issue with you in hopes of getting it top-level attention . 
Defense Minister [PER Alonso  ] has raised the issue in public speeches and his people have raised it in meetings . 
They point to [MISC Spanish  ] purchases like 24 Tomahawk missiles and [LOC US  ] AEGIS combat systems for its [MISC F-100  ] frigates and [MISC S-80  ] subs , which the [ORG GOS  ] made over the protests of [MISC European  ] allies like [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany  ] , and say that while [ORG MOD  ] plans to continue a strong relationship with the [LOC US  ] defense industry and knows that it is getting the best when it buys [LOC US  ] , it would appreciate a " gesture " from the [LOC US  ] so that it can show domestic audiences that [LOC Spain  ] gets something out of the relationship . 
While we continue to push [LOC Spain  ] to buy into the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] program , we know that [LOC Spain  ] is very anxious to learn whether [MISC Spanish  ] company [MISC EADS-CASA  ] will get the [ORG Joint Cargo Aircraft  ] contract . 
We try to remind [ORG MOD  ] that while there may be a dollar imbalance in the defense relationship , [LOC Spain  ] benefits from the relationship in other ways , not only getting the best technology for its military , but also being able to sell products that include [LOC US  ] technology to third countries. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C/NF ) We want to use the [ORG HLDC  ] to further strengthen the [ORG Permanent Committee  ] and are pleased that [ORG EUCOM  ] will propose the joint working group as a means to increase [ORG EUCOM  ] involvement on [MISC Spanish  ] military issues . 
Direct and ongoing communication between [ORG MOD  ] and [ORG EUCOM  ] at the staff level can only help us to avoid minor problems that have the potential to escalate , like [MISC NCIS/OSI  ] .
