Via  ] , Acting Principal Officer , [LOC Peshawar  ] , [ORG Department of State  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( a ) , ( b ) , ( d ) Summary - - - - <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) A senior [LOC Federally Administered Tribal Areas  ] official told Acting Principal Officer ( APO ) that nearly all girls’ schools in the [LOC FATA  ] would be closed by the January 15 , 2009 deadline set by militants ; since then , the militants have relented marginally and allowed girls to attend school up to grade four . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believes the [MISC GOP  ] has given up on [MISC Swat  ] , [ORG Northwest Frontier Province  ] ( [ORG NWFP  ] ) for now . 
The current Khyber operation was launched to counter local militants who had set up operations near [LOC Peshawar  ] as well as to secure truck convoys. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he believes the [MISC GOP  ] does not understand the gravity of the situation in [LOC FATA  ] . 
The predominantly [MISC Shi’a  ] town of [LOC Hangu  ] may be attacked by [MISC Sunni  ] militants during [MISC Muharam  ] celebrations . 
He believes that if the taliban began to control the [ORG NWFP  ] , they could not administer it and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] might need to join their ranks just to survive . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX’s assessment is less hopeful than most of post’s contacts but accurately reflects a growing pessimism and frustration among some concerning the future of the [ORG FATA  ] and [ORG NWFP  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] provided his assessment of the situation in the [ORG Northwest Frontier Province  ] ( [ORG NWFP  ] ) and [LOC Federally Administered Tribal Areas  ] ( [LOC FATA  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] Closure Of Girls Schools ? ------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said some girls schools will likely try to remain technically open after the January 15 deadline set my militants for their closure . 
However , the practical effect will be that almost all government girls’ schools and probably all private girls’ schools in the [LOC FATA  ] will either close or have no students attending them . 
He said this was because of the widespread fear of the taliban [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
( Note: Since this meeting , the local militants have agreed to allow girls to attend school up to grade four . 
) Troop Redeployments --------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that the decision to pull troops out of [MISC Swat  ] was less about needed troops on the border with [LOC India  ] as alleged in the press and more about a decision by the [MISC GOP  ] to “give up on [MISC Swat  ] for now.” He asserted “we have given the taliban the north of [MISC Swat  ] , so why not give them the city of [LOC Mingora  ] too.” [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] who has only anecdotal information about other troop pullouts from [LOC FATA  ] and the [ORG NWFP  ] , opined that these would likely be “token as a show of force for the [LOC India  ] situation.” Khyber Operation - [MISC FATA A Priority  ] ? ----------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated what other post contacts have told us , namely the current operation in Khyber was about more than simply insuring the safety of truck convoys between [LOC Peshawar  ] and [LOC Torkham  ] . 
Local unnamed militants had set up kidnapping for ransom operations near [LOC Peshawar  ] to fund their operations . 
He claimed funding operations through kidnapping had become a major source of revenue for the taliban in [LOC FATA  ] , where previously they had relied more on “outside funding.” He reasoned that this was an indication that the militancy had become a true insurgency that had wider implications for [LOC Pakistan  ] outside the [ORG NWFP  ] , but the [MISC GOP  ] in [LOC Islamabad  ] did not appreciate the gravity of the situation . 
He asserted that “FATA as a federal priority has dropped of the list since the [LOC India  ] situation has come to light.” [ORG PESHAWAR  ] 00000002 002 OF 003 [MISC North Waziristan Location Of Hostages  ] ? -------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) XXXXXXXXXXXX---------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he wanted to say in an unofficial capacity that he and many others could accept Predator strikes as they were surgical and clearly hitting high value targets . 
He mentioned that fear among the local populace in areas where the strikes have been occurring was lessening because “everyone knew that they only hit the house or location of very bad people.” He wondered why the strikes did not seem to target more of the taliban which he reasoned was needed . 
He said “our house is on fire and we need to take drastic actions.” In [MISC Camera Session And ISI  ] ------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] confided that [MISC ISI  ] , ( Note: Pakistan’s military intelligence . 
End note ) , during the in camera session of the parliament recently , had briefed lawmakers and senior [MISC GOP  ] officials concerning the virtues of some taliban elements versus the “real militants.” They reasoned small numbers from some of the militant groups could be useful in future operations in [LOC Kashmir  ] or elsewhere . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said although not everyone present agreed with the assertion it was this line of reasoning that contributed to his fear of the future . 
The Future ---------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The future , according to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , was likely to include an attack by [MISC Sunni  ] militants on the predominantly [MISC Shi’a  ] town of [LOC Hangu  ] during the [MISC Muharam  ] celebrations . 
( Note . 
After [LOC Kurram  ] , [ORG Orakzai Agency  ] , where [LOC Hangu  ] serves as the administrative headquarters , has the second highest concentration of [MISC Shi’a  ] in the region , at almost 10 per cent . 
End note . 
) <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) In six to twelve months , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] predicted , a lack of focus from [LOC Islamabad  ] could leave the taliban in control of both [ORG FATA  ] and [ORG NWFP  ] . 
If that happened , the taliban would need help administering the area . 
He said the prospect was causing him and others to begin to figure out how to individually survive the coming taliban . 
He said “for one I am thinking that the taliban could capture the [ORG NWFP  ] but they don’t know how to administer it so they might need administrators like me and I might have to join the taliban at some point to just survive.” Comment - - - - <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) XXXXXXXXXXXX’s concerns for the future are not widely expressed by other post contacts , at least not in the dark terms he describes , but accurately reflect a growing pessimism and frustration concerning the future of the [ORG FATA  ] and [ORG NWFP  ] . 
Most view the current deteriorating security situation as reversible ; for example , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is hopeful of being able to defeat the militants in the short term . 
Others point to the relative successes of recent engagements in [LOC Bajaur  ] to support their view that the [MISC GOP  ] can turn the tide in both the short and long term. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) The new level of pessimism from [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Nevertheless  ] , it is disturbing that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believes the militants are winning in both [ORG FATA  ] and [ORG NWFP  ] .
