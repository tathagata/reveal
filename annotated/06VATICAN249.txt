( C ) Despite media reports to the contrary , the [LOC Vatican  ] remains officially neutral on the subject of [LOC Turkey  ] 's [ORG EU  ] bid . 
It maintains its position that it sees " no obstacle " to [LOC Turkey  ] 's entry if the [MISC GoT  ] fulfills the [LOC Copenhagen  ] criteria on religious freedom . 
[LOC Holy See  ] officials were quick to speak out and clarify the [LOC Holy See  ] 's stance following media reports on [MISC Turkish  ] PM [PER Erdogan  ] 's claim of new support from [PER Pope Benedict  ] . 
Referring to the [LOC Copenhagen  ] criteria , Cardinal Secretary of State Bertone did make a statement of " hope " that [LOC Turkey  ] would be able to fulfill the conditions put before it regarding its [ORG EU  ] bid . 
While this should not be interpreted as an endorsement of [LOC Turkey  ] 's entering the [ORG Union  ] , it was certainly encouragement for the [MISC GoT  ] to enact needed reforms and continue to work towards integration . 
Top officials including Deputy Foreign Minister equivalent [PER Pietro Parolin  ] have spoken frankly in private , confirming that the pope 's statements in [LOC Turkey  ] did not represent a shift in the [LOC Holy See  ] 's stance . 
[LOC Vatican  ] officials here are waiting for the return of the delegation Friday to hear the back story from [LOC Turkey  ] . 
End Summary. ------------------ Position Unchanged ------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Media have run with [MISC Turkish  ] PM [PER Erdogan  ] 's claim that [PER Pope Benedict  ] told him he now supported [LOC Turkey  ] 's bid to join the [ORG EU  ] . 
In fact , according to various high-level [LOC Vatican  ] officials , the [LOC Holy See  ] 's position has not changed ; the [LOC Vatican  ] remains officially neutral on the subject , and maintains that it sees " no obstacle " to [LOC Turkey  ] 's entry if the [MISC GoT  ] fulfills the criteria established by the December 2002 [LOC Copenhagen Summit  ] ( ref b ) . ------------------- Officials Speak Out ------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( SBU ) [LOC Holy See  ] officials were quick to speak out following reports on [PER Erdogan  ] 's statement . 
Press office director [PER Federico Lombardi  ] issued a statement emphasizing that the [LOC Holy See  ] had neither the power nor the competency to intervene on the precise point of [LOC Turkey  ] 's entry in the [ORG European Union  ] . 
[PER Lombardi  ] did note that the pope had expressed his appreciation for the [ORG Alliance of Civilizations  ] initiative promoted by PM [PER Erdogan  ] , and noted the [LOC Vatican  ] 's encouragement of dialogue on this and related issues . 
New [LOC Holy See  ] FM equivalent Archbishop [PER Dominique Mamberti  ] chimed in that the [LOC Holy See  ] had not expressed an official position on the issue of [LOC Turkey  ] 's entry . 
He also referred to the need for [LOC Turkey  ] to live up to the [LOC Copenhagen  ] criteria , a sentiment echoed by his boss , [LOC Holy See  ] Secretary of State Cardinal [PER Tarcisio Bertone  ] , who said he hoped [LOC Turkey  ] " could fulfill the conditions put before it to join the [ORG European Union  ] . 
" [ Note: [PER Bertone  ] 's statement should not be interpreted as an endorsement of [LOC Turkey  ] 's entering the [ORG Union  ] , but was certainly encouragement for [LOC Turkey  ] to enact needed reforms . 
It was significant as a rare public voicing of the [LOC Vatican  ] 's long-held position on the issue . 
] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Privately , top [LOC Vatican  ] officials including Deputy FM [PER Pietro Parolin  ] have confirmed that the pope 's statements in [LOC Turkey  ] did not represent a shift in the [LOC Holy See  ] stance on [LOC Turkey  ] 's [ORG EU  ] bid . 
" We all hope that [LOC Turkey  ] will take the steps on religious freedom and human rights that are necessary to enter , " a foreign ministry official told us . 
The media will " always say what they want , " but the [LOC Vatican  ] position has not changed , he said . 
Confidentially , he was skeptical about [LOC Turkey  ] 's commitment to religious freedom , expressing doubts , for example , about the [MISC GoT  ] 's new Law on Foundations ( ref a ) . 
He did not elaborate. ------- Comment ------- [LOC VATICAN  ] 00000249 002.2 OF 002 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In the wake of his [LOC Regensburg  ] speech and in an effort to clarify or soften his widely-reported 2004 remarks expressing doubts about [LOC Turkey  ] 's place in the [ORG EU  ] ( please see ref c ) , [PER Benedict  ] likely said something relatively positive about [MISC European  ] integration that [PER Erdogan  ] ( for whatever reason ) interpreted more broadly . 
The pope was certainly trying to put a positive face on his [LOC Turkey  ] trip whenever possible , and his shift in tone from 2004 is noteworthy . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] will maintain its neutrality on the [ORG EU  ] question , but its encouragement of dialogue and further reforms are useful in the context of USG goals on the issue .
