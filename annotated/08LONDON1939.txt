( C ) Summary . 
The [ORG Scottish National Party’s  ] 365 vote victory in yesterday’s [LOC Glasgow East  ] by-election over [ORG Labour  ] is another body blow to [PER Gordon Brown’s  ] political fortunes and , in the immediate aftermath , has fueled speculation that [PER Brown  ] could face a leadership challenge this fall , when MPs return to the [ORG Westminster Village  ] from the summer break . 
A [ORG Labour  ] MP and close advisor to [PER Brown  ] told us the morning after the vote that [PER Brown  ] will be “hunkering down” with his allies over the summer to fend off [ORG Labour  ] party opponents , which [PER Brown  ] “can successfully do for now , ” but the [LOC Glasgow  ] result cannot be explained away as anything other than “a referendum on [ORG Labour”  ] and [PER Brown  ] must react . 
This advisor said [PER Brown  ] has to use the summer vacation period , with MPs out of [LOC London  ] , to develop a new political strategy . 
For now , in part because of the Parliamentary recess , a challenge to [PER Brown’s  ] leadership is not imminent , but the [LOC Glasgow  ] defeat - the third [ORG Labour  ] by-election loss since [PER Brown  ] took power -- might embolden his opponents to act in the fall if [PER Brown  ] cannot turn around Labour’s dismal political standing . 
End Summary . 
A Political Earthquake ---------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) In what the winning [ORG Scottish National Party  ] candidate called a “political earthquake , ” [ORG Labour  ] went down to an unanticipated defeat in yesterday’s [LOC Glasgow East  ] by-election , coming in second to the [ORG SNP  ] , 11,277 to 10,912 . 
With a higher than expected voter turn out of 42 percent , [ORG SNP  ] candidate [PER John Mason’s  ] victory over Labour’s [PER Margaret Curran  ] represents an astonishing 22 percent swing from the last general election in 2005 , in what had been the [ORG Labour  ] party’s 25th safest seat . 
The [MISC Conservatives  ] came in third with 1,639 , with the [MISC Liberal Democrats  ] a distant fourth at 915 votes. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Forsaking its traditional soapbox issue of [MISC Scottish  ] independence , [ORG SNP  ] leader and [MISC Scottish  ] First Minister [PER Alex Salmond  ] personally spearheaded the party’s campaign , turning the by-election into a referendum on [PER Brown  ] and the [ORG Labour Party  ] . 
Although [ORG Labour  ] sent a collection of party heavyweights and Cabinet ministers to campaign for [PER Curran  ] , she could not overcome what appears to have been a lethal mix of [PER Brown’s  ] unpopularity , a strong [ORG SNP  ] which benefited from [PER Alex Salmond’s  ] frequent appearances in the constituency , and voter frustration that the impoverished district has not benefited more from ten years of [ORG Labour  ] rule in [LOC London  ] . 
Labour’s attempts to market the by-election as a “local” -- in order to keep the focus off the Prime Minister -- went unnoticed . 
[PER Nick Brown  ] MP , a close advisor to [PER Brown  ] and his Deputy [ORG Labour  ] Whip in the [LOC Commons  ] , told [PER Poloff  ] the morning after the vote that “there are no quirks we can use to explain this defeat away” and the party has to see the vote as “a referendum on [ORG Labour  ] -- that we lost.” For now , [ORG Labour  ] party spokesmen sent out to speak publicly on the defeat , like [ORG DFID  ] Secretary [PER Douglas Alexander  ] ( a [MISC Scotsman  ] himself ) , are repeating the now oft-heard Labor refrain that the party “will have to reflect long and hard on the results and try to understand the message” voters have sent . 
The [ORG Winners  ] ----------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The winner in yesterday’s election is clearly the [ORG SNP  ] . 
The vote is an enormous boost for the party and its leader , [PER Alex Salmond  ] , who staked a considerable amount of personal prestige on the outcome -- visiting the district ten times during the campaign . 
The [ORG SNP  ] presented the election as a chance to register a referendum on two governments - the [MISC SNP-led  ] government in [LOC Hollyrood  ] or the [ORG Labour  ] government in [LOC Westminster  ] , and the [ORG SNP  ] can now claim victory . 
The party will have to be careful about not becoming too cocky , however , as the SNP’s signature issue , [MISC Scottish  ] independence , was not highlighted during the campaign and most observers agree that , for most voters , their vote was more anti-Labour than a strong embrace of the [LOC SNP.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The other winner the morning after are the [MISC Conservatives  ] , despite their third place finish . 
The [MISC Conservatives  ] are pleased to have done better than expected in this constituency . 
[MISC Conservative  ] leader [PER David Cameron  ] had traveled to the district before the election and delivered a speech on the social causes of poverty and deprivation , stressing a need for personal responsibility rather than [LOC LONDON  ] 00001939 002 OF 002 government action . 
Many [MISC Conservatives  ] thought making the speech in the district was a mistake , but it appears not to have harmed the [MISC Conservative  ] vote . 
[PER Michael Fabricant  ] , a [MISC Tory  ] MP , told [PER Poloff  ] that the third place finish is important to the [MISC Tories  ] because it indicates that [MISC Cameron’s  ] appeal and message is making inroads even in traditionally [MISC Tory-hostile Scotland  ] . 
[PER Cameron  ] himself reacted to the vote by calling for the Prime Minister to hold an immediate general election , a call which the [ORG Prime  ] Minister’s office termed ridiculous . 
What’s Next for [PER Gordon Brown  ] ? ---------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Nick Brown  ] , Labour’s Deputy Chief Whip , told [PER Poloff  ] that [PER Gordon Brown  ] will use the summer months to “hunker down” and keep his party allies close and his party opponents “in line.” [PER Nick Brown  ] , who is one of the [ORG Prime  ] Minster’s closest political advisors , said that as “terrible” as the election outcome was , it would not spark an immediate leadership challenge to the [ORG Prime  ] Minister within the [ORG Labour Party  ] . 
The [ORG Prime  ] Minister , however , has to use the summer parliamentary recess , now underway , to develop a new political message and consider a cabinet shakeup in order to stop his political freefall . 
[PER Nick Brown  ] reported that there are “unconfirmed rumors” of a small number of [ORG Labour  ] party members considering whether to gather signatures for a letter to the [ORG Prime  ] Minister asking that he step down -- supposedly the plotters intend to present the letter on September 5 to the [ORG Prime  ] Minister , the date in 2006 on which [ORG Labour  ] party rebels presented a similar letter to then [ORG Prime  ] Minister [PER Tony Blair  ] -- but [PER Nick Brown  ] said the [ORG Prime  ] Minister and his allies would be able “to slap down” the effort , “if it got off the ground at all.” <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Nick Brown  ] acknowledged that many [ORG Labour  ] members were hoping that an election victory in the [LOC Glasgow  ] by-election , no matter how narrow , would “cauterize” Labour’s political wounds , but with Labour’s loss , many [ORG Labour  ] members will be panicked that the party’s political decline has not yet bottomed out and willing to consider “drastic action.” As Deputy Whip , [PER Nick Brown  ] will be speaking to many MPs over the weekend to “keep their heads about them.” Ultimately , [PER Nick Brown  ] claimed , a leadership challenge to the [ORG Prime  ] Minister is “highly unlikely” for the practical reason that , were the [ORG Labour  ] party to change its leader and give the [LOC UK  ] a third [ORG Prime  ] Minister in three or four years , it would be politically impossible for the party not to call a general election shortly afterwards -- it would be “historically unheard of to have two unelected [ORG Prime Ministers  ] back to back.” [ORG Labour  ] MPs understand , [PER Brown  ] continued , that they would still go down to defeat in such a case so many will be willing to stick with the Prime Minister in the hope he can turn the party’s fortunes around before spring 2010 , when a general election must be called . 
Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) With Parliament on recess on until October 6 , [ORG Labour  ] will have time for “long and hard” reflection . 
Attention now turns to the September party conventions , where [ORG Labour  ] , and possibly more importantly [PER Brown  ] , will have another ( and possibly final ) opportunity to convince voters that [ORG Labour  ] has “listened and learned.” However , unless [PER Brown  ] takes dramatic action , whether a leadership shuffle or new bold policy direction , he may not be able to fend off grumbles from an increasingly anxious party and , though still unlikely , a possible challenge to his position as party leader .
