( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY: [LOC Iceland  ] 's Foreign Minister has announced that [LOC Iceland  ] will increase the number of peacekeepers sent abroad with the [ORG Icelandic Crisis Response Unit  ] ( [ORG ICRU  ] ) , while focusing on civilian projects where [LOC Iceland  ] has particular expertise and restricting behavior ( e.g. wearing battle dress , carrying automatic weapons ) that has dismayed the public . 
The decision reflects an ongoing debate in [LOC Iceland  ] - which has no military - about where to draw the line between being a peacekeeper and being a warrior . 
Post believes that the [ORG GOI  ] 's " softer " peacekeeping policy is a sensible response to public anxiety , but risks offering unrealistic assurances that peacekeeping can be made safe rather than simply safer . 
End summary. --------------------------------------------- - A softer , less ad hoc approach to peacekeeping --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [MISC Icelandic  ] Foreign Minister [PER Valgerdur Sverrisdottir  ] announced on October 19 that the Ministry for [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] is revising its policy on involvement in peacekeeping , with the goal of focusing more on " softer " civil affairs missions where [LOC Iceland  ] has expertise - such as midwife training and airport management , the latter proposal reflecting [LOC Iceland  ] 's experience running airports in [LOC Kosovo  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The FM amplified these comments in her report to the [ORG Althingi  ] ( parliament ) on [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] on November 16 , where she announced an [MISC MFA  ] study of ways in which [LOC Iceland  ] can increase its contribution to [ORG NATO  ] 's [LOC Afghanistan  ] mission , pointing to the need for " experts in the fields of health , law enforcement , and judicial matters . 
" She further requested the [ORG Althingi  ] 's support for draft legislation to formalize the legal framework for the [ORG Icelandic Crisis Response Unit  ] ( [ORG ICRU  ] ) , an [MISC MFA  ] department overseeing [MISC Icelandic  ] peacekeeping efforts. ---------------------------------- [MISC Icelandic  ] peacekeeping on the rise ---------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to the [MISC MFA  ] , [LOC Iceland  ] currently has 25 personnel deployed abroad under the [ORG ICRU  ] aegis: --13 in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( NATO/ISAF management of [ORG Kabul International Airport  ] and training of local [MISC Afghan  ] managers ) ; --10 in [LOC Sri Lanka  ] ( [MISC Sri Lankan  ] Monitoring Mission , monitoring cease-fire implementation - ref A ) ; -- 1 in [LOC Iraq  ] ( [ORG NATO  ] Training Mission-Iraq 's [ORG Public Affairs Officer  ] ) ; and -- 1 in [LOC Serbia  ] ( assigned to [ORG UNIFEM  ] 's [LOC Belgrade  ] office ) Current plans are to increase this number to 34 by the end of 2006 through the deployment of additional personnel to [LOC Sri Lanka  ] ( 1 ) and [LOC Serbia  ] ( 5 ; 2 to [ORG UNIFEM  ] and 3 under a new agreement with [ORG UNICEF  ] ) and a new deployment to [LOC Lebanon  ] of [ORG Explosive Ordnance Disposal  ] ( [ORG EOD  ] ) personnel from the [ORG Icelandic Coast Guard  ] ( 2 [ORG EOD  ] experts and 1 medic ) . 
The [ORG ICRU  ] 's stated goal is 50 deployed personnel by the end of 2008 . 
Funding continues to trend upward ; the [ORG ICRU  ] will receive roughly [MISC ISK  ] 600 million ( $8.6 million ) in 2007 , up from [MISC ISK  ] 573 million ( $8.1 million ) this year and [MISC ISK  ] 463 million ( $6.6 million ) in 2005. --------------------------------- Crossing the line in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ? --------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Icelandic  ] peacekeeping is already weighted towards " softer " tasks , a logical result of the fact that [LOC Iceland  ] does not have a military . 
[LOC Iceland  ] 's participation in foreign peacekeeping efforts began with the deployment of police officers and medical personnel to [LOC Bosnia  ] and [LOC Kosovo  ] ; according to [ORG ICRU  ] figures , roughly 50 Icelanders have served in the [LOC Balkans  ] since 1994 . 
The optics of [MISC Icelandic  ] participation changed markedly in 2003 when [LOC Iceland  ] assumed the role of lead [ORG NATO  ] nation at [LOC Kosovo  ] 's [ORG Pristina Airport  ] . 
[LOC Iceland  ] chose to provide its civilian peacekeepers with uniforms , even ranks and rank insignia - with the aim of improving credibility with [ORG NATO  ] partners . 
Two armed [ORG Icelandic Coast Guard  ] [ORG EOD  ] specialists deployed to [LOC Iraq  ] in 2003 as part of a [MISC Danish  ] unit. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) This " paramilitarization " took place largely out of public view until 2004 , when the [ORG ICRU  ] took on the running of [LOC Kabul  ] [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000431 002 OF 003 [LOC International Airport  ] . 
In line with the more severe threat environment in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the [ORG ICRU  ] personnel took to wearing helmets and body armor and carrying automatic weapons while patrolling their perimeter - a far cry from most [MISC Icelanders'  ] idea of civilian peacekeeping . 
[MISC Icelandic  ] media reports helped to create an image of [MISC Icelandic  ] peacekeepers as overgrown teenagers playing soldier , with some questioning whether an [MISC Icelandic  ] Army of had been created without citizens' knowledge. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) These questions turned to dismay ( and a certain amount of " I told you so " ) in October 2004 when three uniformed Icelanders were injured ( and an [MISC Afghan  ] and an [MISC American  ] civilian killed ) in a grenade/suicide bomb attack when the [ORG ICRU  ] members lingered in [LOC Kabul  ] 's dangerous [LOC Chicken Street  ] market . 
Press and public concern mounted when the [MISC Icelandic  ] unit 's commander in [LOC Kabul  ] as well as the [MISC Icelandic  ] victims cavalierly shrugged off press inquiries about their judgment: " [ Stuff ] happens . 
" --------------------------------- No guns , please - we're [MISC Icelandic  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) After the " [LOC Chicken Street Incident  ] , " the [ORG MFA  ] became increasingly sensitive to accusations it was putting Icelanders at excessive risk . 
[LOC Iceland  ] handed the [ORG Kabul Airport  ] mission over to another [MISC ISAF  ] nation in February 2005 , four months early . 
[LOC Iceland  ] fulfilled a commitment to deploy armed mobile observation teams ( " jeep gangs " in [MISC Icelandic  ] parlance ) to two Provincial Reconstruction Teams ( PRTs ) in [LOC Afghanistan  ] in 2005 and 2006 , but in both cases withdrew its personnel when security worsened . 
Similarly , when [LOC Iceland  ] agreed in January 2006 to resume the [ORG Kabul Airport  ] mission , it did so with the caveat that [MISC Icelanders'  ] roles be limited to airport operations and training , with other peacekeepers pulling guard duty. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The discussion continued when in August 2006 [LOC Iceland  ] agreed to boost its share of the workload in the [MISC Sri Lankan  ] Monitoring Mission ( Ref A ) . 
Commentators asked whether Icelanders had the experience to deal with armed conflict , and argued that " we should confine ourselves to those fields where we have relevant expertise . 
" ----------------------------- Midwives yes , " [ORG Rat Patrol  ] " no ----------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Given this backdrop , most local commentators welcomed the Foreign Minister 's announcement of a more " civilian-oriented " [ORG ICRU  ] ; with most media headlining her comment that the new policy represented " midwives in place of jeep patrols . 
" Opposition lawmakers on the parliamentary [ORG Foreign Affairs Committee  ] declared approval ; one [ORG Social Democratic Alliance MP  ] expressed hope that henceforth " we'll choose the projects we take part in , rather than the projects choosing us . 
" <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG GOI  ] is keen to remain active in peacekeeping . 
[ORG ICRU  ] Director [PER Anna Johannsdottir  ] emphasized to Poloff November 2 that [LOC Iceland  ] intended to live up to its commitments to [ORG NATO  ] and would not bring home its [LOC Afghanistan  ] contingent early . 
Asked to explain the distinction between " more civilian " [ORG ICRU  ] missions and work carried out by the [ORG Icelandic International Development Agency  ] ( [ORG ICEIDA  ] ) , [PER Johannsdottir  ] allowed that the two entities - both under the Foreign Minister 's authority - will now have more in common than previously , but that the [ORG ICRU  ] would focus on post-conflict response and [ORG ICEIDA  ] on long-term development and poverty alleviation. -------------------------------- An inherently dangerous endeavor -------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG MFA  ] officials have confided to post that they do not believe the public is ready for the death of an [MISC Icelandic  ] peacekeeper , which would raise questions " about the value of the mission and whether we should be doing these things , " according to one . 
A senior [ORG MFA  ] official expressed unhappiness with the way the [LOC Chicken Street Incident  ] was handled , noting to the Ambassador that those in charge had tried to " sweep the problem under the rug . 
" This made the [ORG MFA  ] and [ORG ICRU  ] look amateurish when the full story emerged . 
The official acknowledged the [ORG MFA  ] 's need to learn to be more frank to ensure the public understands the inherent risks of peacekeeping in case something unfortunate occurs . 
[ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000431 003 OF 003 ------- Comment ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Icelandic Government  ] 's desire to codify its policy on peacekeeping brings needed clarity to what has been a largely ad hoc exercise , and should strengthen support across the political spectrum for the idea of Icelanders serving abroad . 
That said , the move carries with it some downsides for the [ORG GOI  ] and its international partners . 
It will become harder to encourage the [ORG GOI  ] to assist in areas it has not deemed within its area of competence . 
So long as the [ORG GOI  ] remains willing to include within its definition of acceptable operations such high-value ops as airport management ( as in [LOC Kosovo  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] ) , peace monitoring ( as in [LOC Sri Lanka  ] ) , and [ORG EOD  ] ( albeit increasingly in relatively permissive environments such as [LOC Lebanon  ] but no longer in hot spots like [LOC Iraq  ] ) , we should remain satisfied with [LOC Iceland  ] 's contribution. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The larger risk is posed by the apparently widespread public conception - which the [ORG MFA  ] has not addressed head on - that by assigning its personnel only to civil affairs projects , [LOC Iceland  ] can largely eliminate the risk of casualties . 
Post has cautioned host officials of the importance of presenting the public with a realistic assessment of the inherent dangers of all peacekeeping , lest the next casualty leave the public and opposition too rattled to continue .
