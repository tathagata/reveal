Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] is officially still studying the issue of whether to associate with the [LOC Copenhagen  ] Accord on Climate Change . 
Behind the scenes , we understand serious discussions are taking place about which road will best serve the Kingdom’s long term interests . 
On one hand , [MISC Saudi  ] Arabia’s lead climate change negotiator has criticized the [LOC Copenhagen  ] process in private and in public , arguing that the [ORG UNFCCC  ] process is the only acceptable legal framework . 
On the other hand , [MISC Saudi  ] officials are very eager to obtain investment credits for [MISC Carbon Capture  ] and [ORG Storage  ] ( [ORG CCS  ] ) and other technology transfer projects that will only become available once an agreement has been reached . 
[MISC Saudi  ] officials express concern about the impact a transition to a low-carbon energy mix will have on the country’s revenue stream at a time when it faces enormous financing needs to transform its economy to create jobs for its young , growing population . 
It also fears imposed economic costs associated with “demonizing” oil . 
Part of the explanation for this schizophrenic position is that the [ORG Saudi Government  ] has not yet thought through all the implications of a climate change agreement , in part because it may not fully understand the various demand scenarios . 
There appears to be a growing sense within the [ORG SAG  ] that it may be in danger of becoming isolated on climate change , which may prompt a re-examination of its position . 
[MISC Saudi  ] officials have suggested that they need to find a way to climb down gracefully from the country’s tough negotiating position . 
More sustained engagement in coordination with other governments , particularly if pitched as an effort to develop partnership , may help them do so . 
End Summary . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] not yet Decided on [LOC Copenhagen  ] Accord --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC Saudi  ] Arabia’s lead climate change negotiator Dr. [PER Mohammad Al-Sabban  ] told Econoffs February 3 the [LOC United States  ] should adopt a more inclusive , transparent approach to [ORG United Nations Forum for Climate Change Cooperation  ] ( [ORG UNFCCC  ] ) negotiations . 
Although he was encouraged by President Obama’s attitude towards developing country partners in the negotiations , [PER Al-Sabban  ] said the parties needed to “learn from the mistakes” of [LOC Copenhagen  ] in thinking about preparing for the next [ORG Conference of Parties  ] ( CoP ) in [LOC Mexico  ] . 
[PER Al-Sabban  ] said developing countries felt their [MISC Danish  ] hosts forced them to decide on the [LOC Copenhagen  ] Accord with practically no notice . 
Heads of state were also called into the negotiations too early and they applied too much pressure “when the deal was not there , ” he said . 
In specific response to the [LOC U.S.  ] request for support for the [LOC Copenhagen  ] Accord ( ref H ) , [PER Al-Sabban  ] said [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] was still studying the accord to determine its position . 
The [ORG SAG  ] cares about the environment , but it also must care for its citizens , he said . 
Addressing [MISC Saudi  ] Economic Concerns Key to Progress --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Asked how to move forward on a global climate change commitment , [PER Al-Sabban  ] agreed negotiations need a “speedy outcome , ” and said countries need to rebuild trust and confidence through more transparent negotiations . 
He reminisced fondly about the inclusive nature of the initial [ORG Kyoto Protocol  ] negotiations , which he said should be replicated in [LOC Cancun  ] . 
[PER Al-Sabban  ] said climate change negotiations should remain under the [ORG UNFCCC  ] and not be pursued under alternative frameworks. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Asked about tangible actions to reach national climate change goals , [PER Al-Sabban  ] said [MISC Saudi  ] Arabia’s nationally appropriate actions would include carbon capture and storage ( [ORG CCS  ] ) credits . 
He emphasized [MISC Saudi  ] Arabia’s need for technology transfer and foreign direct investment to mitigate the adverse impact that emissions-reducing policies may have on the [ORG Kingdom  ] . 
[PER Al-Sabban  ] said the [ORG SAG  ] had closely studied climate change policies’ potential negative impacts . 
The [ORG Kingdom  ] will need time to diversify its economy away from petroleum , he said , noting that a [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to help [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] with its economic diversification efforts would “take the pressure off climate change negotiations.” <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Al-Sabban  ] said the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies was key to addressing [MISC Saudi  ] Arabia’s domestic energy demand , and he acknowledged the need for increased energy efficiency awareness . 
The deployment of [ORG CCS  ] technology , he said , was “crucial” for [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
He said the [LOC U.S.  ] Administration’s rhetoric to end dependence on foreign oil , reiterated by President [PER Obama  ] in [LOC Copenhagen  ] , is antagonistic and causes genuine fear in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
The [ORG SAG  ] is concerned about the outlook for oil demand and global production , and fears it will not be able to diversify in time to reach its development goals . 
Shadow Negotiator [ORG Suggests Partnership  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG Senior Advisor  ] to the President of [LOC Meteorology  ] and Environment ( [ORG PME  ] ) [PER Fawaz Al-Alamy  ] told Econoffs January 27 the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] share the same values on climate change , but have different negotiation tactics . 
[PER Al-Alamy  ] , who joined [ORG PME  ] in late 2009 and led [MISC Saudi  ] Arabia’s [ORG World Trade Organization  ] ( [ORG WTO  ] ) negotiations , said [MISC Saudi  ] Petroleum Minister [PER Ali Al-Naimi  ] wants to move forward in [ORG UNFCCC  ] negotiations . 
( Note: [ORG PME  ] sends three representatives with [PER Al-Sabban  ] to climate change negotiations . 
End note . 
) Al-Sabban’s negative approach to negotiations “disheartens” him , as does the ongoing “blame game” on climate change . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , like [LOC China  ] and [LOC India  ] , needs to behave like an emerging economy rather than a developing country , he said . 
[PER Al-Alamy  ] noted he had met the previous day with both the [MISC Chinese  ] and the [MISC Indian  ] Ambassadors to the [ORG Kingdom  ] to discuss climate change. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Al-Alamy  ] recommended several steps for [LOC U.S.  ] engagement with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] on climate change , including active outreach to all the key players including [PER Al-Sabban  ] , Petroleum Minister [PER Al-Naimi  ] , and [ORG PME  ] President [PER Prince Turki  ] bin [PER Nasser  ] . 
[PER Al-Alamy  ] recommended the [LOC U.S.  ] reach out to the [ORG Gulf Cooperation Council  ] ( [ORG GCC  ] ) Secretary General , who has the power to tone down the alarm in the rest of the [MISC Arab  ] world , such as in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
[PER Al-Alamy  ] recommended the [LOC U.S.  ] continue to coordinate its approach with other [MISC Embassies  ] , which he said has been very effective . 
Asked how to get beyond the [ORG Kyoto Protocol  ] lens through which [PER Al-Sabban  ] views climate negotiations , [PER Al-Alamy  ] quickly replied “he only has two more years to talk about [ORG Kyoto”  ] before it expires. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Al-Alamy  ] said that Minister of Petroleum [PER Al-Naimi  ] strongly supports solar energy as he believes it will displace oil currently used in the power sector and ultimately increase oil exports . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] currently uses 1.5 million barrels per day to produce electricity and water , he said . 
The [ORG Kingdom  ] is considering beginning a civilian nuclear program , and top leadership including Minister of [ORG Foreign Affairs Saud Al-Faisal  ] supports the increased use of renewable energy sources . 
Some , however , view [LOC Copenhagen  ] as a serious threat to [MISC Saudi  ] Arabia’s economic stability. “Ask any [MISC Saudi  ] , ” [PER Al-Alamy  ] said , “they all think [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] will be asked to foot the bill for climate change.” [PER Al-Alamy  ] outlined [MISC Saudi  ] Arabia’s top concerns , including its strong aversion to mixing trade and environmental priorities . 
If duties are placed on oil and gas , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] will not be able to move ahead with its economic diversification plans , and this creates a “phobia” of climate change talks , he said . 
The [MISC Saudis  ] also resent the [LOC U.S.  ] when it makes decisions “without consulting its friends.” [PER Al-Alamy  ] said [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , and [PER Al-Sabban  ] in particular , needs to feel like a partner of [LOC U.S.  ] decision making . 
Is [PER Al-Naimi  ] the Problem ? ------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) Minister [PER Al-Naimi  ] has consistently been rational and practical in talking with western delegations about climate change , noting that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] had to address its development concerns , but conceding that the world needs to work together to address climate change . 
These reassuring statements stand in sharp contrast to Al-Sabban’s public comments , such as questioning the science behind climate change just before [LOC Copenhagen  ] , and his often obstructionist behavior , as reported by a number of [MISC Embassies  ] in [LOC Riyadh  ] , during working-level negotiations . 
[ORG Senior Ministry of Petroleum  ] officials have reassured us after each of Al-Sabban’s public outbursts over the last six months that he has been “tamed” and brought back onto the reservation . 
The frequency and number of times that [MISC Al-Sabban  ] steps out of line , and the apparent lack of any sanction , raises questions about the real [MISC Saudi  ] position on climate change. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) A recent conversation with [ORG UK Embassy  ] officers suggests that indeed [PER Al-Naimi  ] may have some questions about climate change . 
They report that [PER Al-Naimi  ] was sharply critical of the [LOC Copenhagen  ] meetings and the climate change effort in general , in marked contrast to earlier meetings . 
He complained that heads of state were brought in to negotiate the final stages , which prevented [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] from voicing its true opposition to several elements . 
He also questioned the legality of the [LOC Copenhagen  ] process and its future direction. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) A senior [ORG Ministry of Petroleum  ] official explained that , leaving [LOC Copenhagen  ] , the [MISC Saudi  ] delegation was convinced that the [LOC Copenhagen  ] accord would not attract significant support , apparently largely based on Al-Sabban’s analysis . 
The [MISC Minister’s  ] office was unpleasantly surprised by mid-January , when it was clear that a number of countries had already associated themselves with the accord . 
Assistant Petroleum Minister [PER Prince Abdulaziz  ] bin [PER Salman  ] told [PER EconCouns  ] that he had spent two days walking Minister [PER Al-Naimi  ] through each of the 90 plus submissions on the [ORG UNFCCC  ] web site . 
[PER Prince Abdulaziz  ] told the Minister that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] had missed a real opportunity to submit “something clever , ” like [LOC India  ] or [LOC China  ] , that was not legally binding but indicated some goodwill towards the process without compromising key economic interests . 
The [PER Prince  ] intimated to [PER EconCouns  ] that [MISC Al-Sabban  ] would not long retain his position , and said the challenge for [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] was to find a way to “climb down” from its negotiating position . 
Comment ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) All indications are that [MISC Saudi  ] officials are intensely discussing what position the country should take . 
We believe that the message is getting through , that there is a broad consensus among countries that tangible action needs to be taken now to address climate change . 
We also think that [MISC Saudi  ] leaders are beginning to understand that they are in increasing danger of being left behind . 
They do have significant , legitimate concerns about how this process will affect their long-term livelihood . 
Our conversations , however , with officials in Finance , Petroleum and the other economic ministries suggests that they have not done sufficient economic analysis of the various scenarios to understand what the real impact of a climate change agreement might be . 
Such a discussion might help provide the kind of dispassionate basis to address legitimate [MISC Saudi  ] concerns , while also making a better case for the need to take action to mitigate increasing emissions . 
We take as an encouraging sign the fact that several [MISC Saudi  ] officials have noted to us that the [ORG Kyoto  ] agreement only runs for two more years , suggesting that some at least understand the need to chart a more assured future course . 
We take the suggestion seriously that we help the [MISC Saudis  ] find a way to climb down from their current position , ideally by offering the hand of partnership , which may help persuade the rest of [ORG OPEC  ] to follow suit . 
For now , we believe that success will require a sustained , broad engagement with [MISC Saudi  ] leadership , as we think the problem is more than just a rogue negotiator , but some broadly shared fears about the future , and uncertainty about the way forward .
