REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: One of the [LOC UK  ] 's top pest eradication firms has won a contract with the [MISC Libyan  ] government to exterminate rodents in the cities of [LOC Tripoli  ] , [ORG Sirte  ] , and [LOC Benghazi  ] , to fill a gap that the government-run pest control program has been unable to address . 
When a [MISC Bubonic Plague  ] outbreak hit [LOC Tobruk  ] a few months ago , [ORG Rentokil  ] was asked to extend its work-zone to that city . 
The general manager of [ORG Rentokil  ] told [ORG Econoff  ] he sees a great need for pest eradication companies in [LOC Libya  ] . 
His firm plans to expand its operations from the public to the private sphere in October by launching a new joint-venture with a local [MISC Libyan  ] company . 
End summary . 
[ORG RENTOKIL  ] - FROM EXTERMINATION TO CARTOGRAPHY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Rentokil  ] , one of the [LOC UK  ] 's top pest eradication firms , was contracted in July 2008 by the [ORG GOL  ] 's General People 's Committee for [ORG Infrastructure  ] ( Ministry-equivalent ) , headed by Secretary [PER Matuq Matuq  ] , to exterminate rodents in the cities of [LOC Tripoli  ] , [LOC Misurata  ] , and [LOC Benghazi  ] . 
According to [PER Richard Jones  ] , General Manager of [ORG Rentokil  ] 's branch office in [LOC Libya  ] , there is a huge need for not only rodent control services but also for eradicating roaches and other insects in [MISC Libyan  ] cities . 
He said the need was so great that other companies , including [LOC U.S.  ] firms , would be welcome support in the effort. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In January 2008 , the [ORG GOL  ] contacted [ORG Rentokil  ] in search for a pest control company to help eradicate a growing rodent population across the country . 
Until that point , the [ORG GOL  ] had operated its own pest control technician teams , but recognized that its traditional methods of controlling the pest and rodent populations were no longer effective . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] authorities suspected that the rodent population had developed a resistance to the anti-coagulant used by the [ORG GOL  ] teams . 
According to [ORG Rentokil  ] , the rodents act as vectors for serious diseases in [LOC Libya  ] , including [MISC Bubonic Plague  ] , Leptospirosis , [LOC Salmonella  ] , [PER Enterica Serovar Typhimurium  ] , [PER Esosinophilic Meningitis  ] , and rat bite fever . 
Additionally , the vector for [LOC Leschmaniasis  ] , the sand fly , harbors on a rodent known as [PER Psammomys Obesus  ] , or the fat sand rat . 
The [ORG GOL  ] therefore created a " [ORG National Program  ] for the Control of Rodents Harmful to Health " in 2008 to combat the country 's growing rodent and pest problem . 
After a few months of negotiations , [ORG Rentokil  ] concluded a contract with the [ORG GOL  ] in July 2008. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In [LOC Tripoli  ] , [ORG Rentokil  ] has 150,000 bait stations set-up to eradicate rats . 
[ORG Rentokil  ] staff monitor the numbers of dead rodents they find on ground surfaces , which then allows them to estimate the numbers of rodents killed who have retreated to their holes in the ground . 
They have developed a grid system , using state-of-the-art information technology systems . 
The staff also use hand-held [ORG PDA  ] devices to keep track of the data in the field . 
To overcome the challenge of [LOC Libya  ] 's lack of street addresses or mapping grids , [ORG Rentokil  ] has developed a mapping system using Satellite imagery and [PER Google Earth  ] ; all the bait stations are plotted onto this system. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG Rentokil  ] inherited many employees from the [MISC Libyan  ] government and had to retrain people in their techniques and also had to provide [MISC English  ] language training so the [MISC Libyans  ] could communicate with the [ORG Rentokil  ] staff from the [LOC UK  ] ( which include 32 expatriates ) . 
[PER Jones  ] noted they have had to deal with significant attrition as the [MISC Libyan  ] government staff was " not used to working that hard , " and some employees have left without advanced notice . 
[ORG Rentokil  ] is attempting to limit its attrition rates by tripling the government salaries of former [ORG GOL  ] employees . 
PLAGUE OUTBREAK IN TOBRUK: [ORG RENTOKIL  ] BROUGHT IN TO HELP 6 . 
( C ) Touching on the outbreak of the [MISC Bubonic Plague  ] in [LOC Libya  ] 's eastern city of [LOC Tobruk  ] earlier this summer , [PER Hill  ] explained the rodents had moved into populated areas after construction projects upset piping systems . 
This resulted in the death of more rodents than usual , and the fleas on those animals jumped onto livestock and other animals living near people , spreading disease to the human population . 
[PER Hill  ] estimated that up to 20 people died as a result of this outbreak . 
He said [ORG Rentokil  ] was asked to go to [LOC Tobruk  ] to help [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000705 002.2 OF 002 exterminate the rodents , although the city was not part of their original scope of work . 
RENTOKIL'S LESSONS LEARNED <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Having heard that the [ORG GOL  ] was famous for late payments , [PER Jones  ] told [ORG Econoff  ] that [ORG Rentokil  ] required a sizeable up-front payment , which allowed the firm to begin the set-up of operations , including finding office space and housing , recruiting staff , and shipping supplies to [LOC Libya  ] . 
They also require all communications to be in writing with their client , the General People 's Committee for [ORG Infrastructure  ] , headed by Secretary [PER Matuq Matuq  ] . 
[PER Jones  ] told [ORG Econoff  ] that the pest control sector in [LOC Libya  ] is dominated by academics , many of whom approach their work from a theoretical perspective . 
Through [ORG Rentokil  ] 's retraining of [MISC Libyan  ] government staff , they have emphasized a more practical , hands-on approach that has taken more time but proven to be worthwhile in the end . 
[PER Jones  ] noted there are very few private companies working in pest control in [LOC Libya  ] and he sees room for other companies , including [LOC U.S.  ] firms , to pursue opportunities here. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Now that [ORG Rentokil  ] is established in [LOC Libya  ] , it plans to expand to the private sector and will enter into a joint venture with [MISC Libyan  ] company , [PER Shahdi  ] , in October . 
[PER Shahdi  ] already provides motorpool services for the [MISC American  ] construction management firm [ORG AECOM  ] but will be new to the pest control market . 
[ORG Rentokil  ] will hold 65 percent of the new joint venture . 
[PER Jones  ] noted that it has taken four to five months to register the company. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Comment: [ORG Rentokil  ] 's success thus far in [LOC Libya  ] is encouraging , as it demonstrates there are opportunities for service provider companies in key sectors , such as pest management , which is a critical component for safeguarding environmental health . 
This [MISC UK-based  ] company has seized upon an unmet need and used it as a spring-board for forming a private joint venture company with a [MISC Libyan  ] partner . 
[MISC U.S.-based  ] companies may be able to emulate [ORG Rentokil  ] not only in the pest management sector but in other areas , such as healthcare , urban planning , and wastewater treatment .
