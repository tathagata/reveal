REASONS: 1.4 ( B ) ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary . 
Senior [MISC Brazilian  ] Government ( [ORG GOB  ] ) officials told emboffs that they viewed the 4 May meeting in [LOC Puerto Iguazu  ] , [LOC Argentina  ] as a " successful symbolic event " that demonstrated Presidents [PER Lula  ] , [PER Morales  ] , [PER Chavez  ] and [PER Kirchner  ] remain commited to regional cooperation and can talk productively about energy issues , in the wake of [LOC Bolivia  ] 's sudden nationalization of foreign-owned energy installations on May Day . 
But the gap between the [ORG GOB  ] 's official spin and public reactions appears wide . 
The tone of reporting in much of [LOC Brazil  ] 's media remains highly critical of the [ORG GOB  ] 's handling of the situation , and continues to depict an emerging [MISC Morales-Chavez  ] axis that is pursuing an agenda at [PER Lula  ] 's expense . 
End summary . 
A POLITICAL GESTURE... ---------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Raimundo Magno  ] , diplomatic advisor to Civil Household Minister [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] , told Charge on 5 May that the [LOC Argentina  ] meeting was viewed by the [ORG GOB  ] as a " successful symbolic event . 
" The [ORG GOB  ] 's intention was not to engage in hard bargaining or concrete policy negotiations , but " to send a message " that the presidents are still united in seeking the goal of regional integration , and would be able to work together on the gas issues. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In an earlier conversation on 4 May with PolCouns , [PER Marcel Biato  ] , deputy foreign affairs advisor to President [PER Lula  ] , had conveyed a similar message . 
[PER Biato  ] had not received a briefing on the meeting , but made a few observations: -- The [LOC Argentina  ] meeting is &a political gesture8 that [PER Lula  ] and [PER Kirchner  ] conceived on 2 May . 
The [MISC Brazilians  ] wanted to use the summit to reinforce their continued political commitment to regional integration and comity , despite the events of recent days . 
At the same time , [PER Lula  ] intended to make it clear that the issues with [LOC Bolivia  ] and [ORG Petrobras  ] are strictly bilateral in nature . 
[PER Biato  ] said that [PER Lula  ] , s &soft8 position in the past two days is intentional , to leave him room for maneuver . 
[ORG Petrobras  ] President [PER Gabrielli  ] is providing the hard line in public , i.e. , no price increase , no more investment in this climate , ready to go to arbitration . 
This is choreographed , a deliberate tactic , [PER Biato  ] said . 
( Comment: But it should be noted that [PER Lula  ] seemed to publicly undercut [PER Gabrielli  ] 's hard line at the [LOC Argentina  ] meeting , saying there is still the possibility of new [MISC Brazilian  ] investment . 
End comment . 
) -- Asked whether [LOC Planalto  ] is not concerned about the harsh media reaction depicting [PER Lula  ] , s response as weak , [PER Biato  ] said [PER Lula  ] and the [ORG GOB  ] see no profit in &engaging in megaphone diplomacy8 with [PER Morales  ] , and that the [MISC Brazilian  ] media and public will come around to seeing the merit in a circumspect approach , &as the markets are already recognizing.8 Results are what count: if the [ORG GOB  ] keeps the gas flowing at stable prices while [ORG Petrobras  ] pursues its legal options , the wisdom of [PER Lula  ] , s approach will be vindicated . 
Keeping a dialogue going is useful , [PER Biato  ] said , because [PER Morales  ] is going to realize sooner or later that [LOC Bolivia  ] is not [LOC Venezuela  ] -- i.e. , foreign companies will , in fact , walk away if they must , so he needs to deal . 
[PER Biato  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] is looking for this realization and perhaps political changes that come in [LOC Bolivia  ] with the constituent assembly as factors that may affect [PER Morales  ] , position . 
-- Challenged about the growing public perception in [LOC Brazil  ] that [PER Morales  ] and [PER Chavez  ] are in cahoots at [PER Lula  ] , s expense , and whether this does not undermine [LOC Brazil  ] , s regional unity vision , [PER Biato  ] was laconic. &What are we supposed to do ? 
We can , t choose our neighbors . 
We don , t like [PER Chavez  ] , s modus operandi or [PER Morales  ] , surprises , but we have to manage these guys somehow , and keep the regional integration idea alive.8 .. . 
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN A DUD ---------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) But looking at [MISC Brazilian  ] media coverage of the [LOC Argentina  ] meeting , it is far from clear that the symbolism was as successful as the [ORG GOB  ] hoped . 
Most [MISC Brazilian  ] press following the meeting focused on [PER Lula  ] 's failure to achieve any breakthroughs , and commentators continued to criticize the [ORG GOB  ] response as weak and inadequate . 
Respected columnist [PER Miriam Leitao  ] stated on [ORG TV Globo  ] that " President [PER Lula  ] has been inept throughout this crisis . 
The trip and joint interview were a disaster . 
It is obvious that it was not the moment to show solidarity with [MISC Morales...This  ] was a disastrous week . 
" Leading daily " [LOC Estado de Sao Paulo  ] " carried comments by former [MISC Brazilian  ] ambassador and [ORG Brazilian Petroleum Agency  ] CEO [PER Sebastiao de Rego Barros Netto  ] expressing his bewilderment at the passivity with which [PER Lula  ] has reacted to events in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
And former [MISC Brazilian  ] Ambassador to the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Rubens Barbosa  ] noted in " [LOC Folha de Sao Paulo  ] " that [LOC Brazil  ] 's " national interest should come ahead of anything . 
The government is minimizing the expropriation . 
" [MISC Brazilian  ] media also highlighted a report in " The [MISC Economist  ] " -- widely respected in [LOC Brazil  ] 's policy and finance communities -- saying the events in [LOC Bolivia  ] are a victory for [PER Chavez  ] and his proxy , [PER Morales  ] , and a defeat for [PER Lula  ] . 
The optics were hardly kinder than the editorials . 
A large photo on the front page of " [LOC Estado de Sao Paulo  ] " shows an awkward [PER Lula  ] standing between [PER Kircher  ] , [PER Morales  ] and [PER Chavez  ] -- the three of whom appear to be laughing at some joke told at [PER Lula  ] 's expense . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Ineptitude and mixed signals continue to characterize the [ORG GOB  ] 's response to [MISC Morales'  ] fait accompli . 
And the [MISC Brazilian  ] public and media remain riled up in an unusually vociferous way , voicing frustration with the [ORG GOB  ] and growing suspicion -- if not outright animosity -- toward [PER Chavez  ] and [PER Morales  ] . 
It remains to be seen whether the public ire continues . 
( [MISC Brazilians  ] can forget such things quickly when the [MISC World Cup  ] is on the horizon . 
) The real story of [LOC Brazil  ] 's response is probably just starting now , and will likely play out in the hard-headed world of corporate board rooms and arbitration court , with [ORG Petrobras  ] -- which has legal obligations and share holder demands that may ultimately trump [PER Lula  ] 's faltering dream of regional leadership -- doing the talking that matters for the [MISC Brazilian  ] side . 
We will touch base with key political and energy sector contacts in the next days and report new developments .
