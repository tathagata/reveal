<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 [ORG DUSHANBE  ] 001464 SIPDIS SIPDIS STATE FOR SCA/CEN , EUR/RUS , [LOC EUR/CARC  ] , PM , S/P EO 12958 DECL: 8/1/2016 TAGS PGOV , PREL , MARR , GG , RS , [ORG TI SUBJECT: OLD-GUARD TAJIK  ] MINISTER OF DEFENSE OBSESSES ON [ORG NATO  ] , [LOC GEORGIA  ] [ORG DUSHANBE  ] 00001464 001.2 OF 002 CLASSIFIED BY: [PER Richard E. Hoagland  ] , Ambassador , Embassy [ORG Dushanbe  ] , [ORG State Department  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: The Ambassador endured a three-hour-plus one-on-one lunch August 1 with Tajikistan’s Minister of [ORG Defense  ] [PER Sherali Khairulloyev  ] . 
Apart from the general conversation , the minister apologized for previous mil-mil relations that didn’t meet expectations ; harped repeatedly on [ORG NATO  ] , [LOC Georgia  ] , and [PER Saakashvili  ] ; and asserted the [ORG Shanghai Cooperation Organization  ] must become a military bloc to face down [ORG NATO  ] . 
By the end of the alcohol-sodden lunch , the minister was slurring and unsteady on his feet . 
We suspect President [PER Rahmonov  ] ordered the minister to host this farewell lunch . 
While it was rather unusual in many respects , we believe it helped place another brick in the wall of [MISC U.S.-Tajikistan  ] military relations . 
END SUMMARY <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Defense Minister [PER Khairulloyev  ] apologized several times for “misunderstandings and missed opportunities” in the past in [MISC U.S.-Tajik  ] military relations . 
He asserted repeatedly that he expects an increasingly smooth and productive relationship . 
He said he has come to understand [LOC Tajikistan  ] must have a number of equal partners , not just one [ [LOC Russia  ] ] , if it is to propser. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Minister [PER Khairulloyev  ] returned several times to [ORG NATO  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] . 
He repeatedly asked , “Why does [ORG NATO  ] want a country like [LOC Georgia  ] ? 
Even the [ORG Warsaw Pact  ] didn’t subsume losers ! ” He asked if [ORG NATO  ] will improve [LOC Georgia’s  ] “hopeless” economy . 
He asked why the [LOC United States  ] “indulges the adolescent” President [PER Saakashvili  ] . 
The only possibly explanation , he asserted , is to “stick your finger in [LOC Moscow’s  ] eye.” He added , “When Stalin created the [ORG Georgian Socialist Republic  ] , he threw in [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia  ] because [MISC Georgians  ] on their own were a `fly speck.’ Without [LOC Abhkazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia  ] , ” he alleged , “Georgia has no hope of existing.” <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Khairulloyev  ] volunteered that the [ORG Shanghai Cooperation Organization  ] ( [ORG SCO  ] ) has to develop to become a military bloc “with one-third of the world’s population” to face down [ORG NATO  ] . 
The Ambassador asked why [LOC Russia  ] and the former [MISC Soviet  ] republics view [ORG NATO  ] as an enemy . 
[PER Khairulloyev  ] hoisted himself up and declared , “When the [ORG Warsaw Bloc  ] disintergrated , of course a new bloc emerged for world domination . 
That’s the historical dialectic . 
It’s now time to confront [LOC NATO.” COLOR  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) This lunch took place in Minister Khairulloyev’s private dining room off his recently renovated private office . 
He emphasized that he seldom receives guests in his private office and , especially , that only one other ambassador had ever dined in his private dining room - former [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador [PER Maksim Peshkov.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The Ambassador lost track of the toasts after the tenth . 
His shot-glass held vodka . 
The minister’s high-ball glass was kept filled with un-cut Scotch . 
Late into the lunch , the minister was slurring badly and was not walking a straight line . 
Nevertheless , as the Ambassador kept attempting a gracious retreat , the Minister insisted on showing him “secret rooms” in the ministry . 
Each “secret room” was merely another public conference room with a large fresh flower display and - again and again - another round of toasts set out . 
COMMENT <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) This bizarre event was curious , because [MISC U.S.-Tajik  ] military relations have incrementally been improving , especially with the [ORG National Guard  ] , but also with the [ORG Russia-centric Ministry of Defense  ] . 
[PER Khairulloyev  ] continues to make clear he [ORG DUSHANBE  ] 00001464 002.2 OF 002 serves at the pleasure of President [PER Rahmonov  ] and may be replaced after the November presidential election . 
Although this drunk-fest is how many old-guard former [MISC Soviets  ] do mutual business , it was most unusual for an [MISC American  ] guest . 
It was , to a degree , a mark of respect . 
We would not be surprised if President [PER Rahmonov  ] had ordered [PER Khairulloyev  ] to “do something for the departing Ambassador , ” and we rather wonder if this may have been a sort of valedictory by an old-guard security minister who suspects his days of service are numbered . 
Whatever , we were pleased to have drunk [PER Khairulloyev  ] well under the table . 
END COMMENT .
