( C ) Summary: [MISC Libyan  ] Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] brought hundreds of companions and his trademark sensational fanfare with him on his first trip to [LOC Italy  ] - [LOC Libya  ] 's former colonial master . 
In a read-out to the Ambassador , the [MISC Italian  ] Ambassador ( protect ) described the myriad near misses and embarrassments: the visit was nearly canceled while [PER Qadhafi  ] 's plane circled due to PM [PER Berlusconi  ] 's back pain , denizens of the [ORG Eternal City  ] were embarrassed by [PER Qadhafi  ] 's frequent and public statements decrying [LOC Italy  ] 's occupation , and [MISC Italians  ] were angered by [PER Qadhafi  ] 's implication that [LOC U.S.  ] airstrikes against [LOC Tripoli  ] and [LOC Benghazi  ] in 1986 were akin to the September 11 attacks . 
On substantive issues , leaders discussed [MISC African  ] and migration issues , with [PER Qadhafi  ] suggesting that [ORG EU  ] payments of 1 billion [MISC Euros  ] per year to [LOC Libya  ] would enable him to solve the root problems that cause migration . 
The two nations signed several agreements addressing double taxation , maritime resources , an [MISC MOU  ] on visa issuance , and an [MISC Italian-funded  ] scholarship for 100 [MISC Libyan  ] students . 
While [PER Qadhafi  ] 's provocative statements and protocol demands proved a difficult pill to swallow , the [MISC Italians  ] are hopeful that his historic trip was the last piece of the re-engagement puzzle and will allow them to close a painful and difficult chapter in the [MISC Libyan-Italian  ] bilateral relationship . 
End Summary . 
2 . 
( C ) Just returned from his accompanying the [MISC Libyan  ] delegation of Colonel [PER Qadhafi  ] to [LOC Rome  ] ( June 10-13 ) , [MISC Italian  ] Ambassador [PER Francesco Trupiano  ] briefed the Ambassador and [ORG EU  ] diplomats on June 17 on the historic visit 's results . 
[PER Trupiano  ] said his mission had issued over 446 visas for the delegation ( not including those officials who already had multi-entry permits ) which traveled in 4 airplanes and ferried all vehicles and an ambulance as well . 
Interestingly , [PER Trupiano  ] also said -- given the close relationship between PM [PER Berlusconi  ] and [PER Qadhafi  ] -- that arrangements for the trip had been made by direct contact between their two offices . 
There had been several trips by senior [MISC Libyan  ] officials in the past several weeks to firm up the program for the visit . 
3 . 
( C ) [PER Qadhafi  ] 's core delegation consisted of [ORG National Security Adviser  ] ( and son ) [ORG Muatassim  ] , [PER Qadhafi  ] , cousin and envoy on [MISC Egyptian  ] affairs Colonel [PER Ahmed Qaddafadam  ] , Foreign Minister [PER Musa Kusa  ] , MFA Secretary for [LOC Arab Affairs  ] [PER Mohammed Siala  ] , interpreter [PER Fuad Zlitney  ] , and [ORG National Oil  ] chairman [PER Shukri Ghanem  ] . 
[PER Trupiano  ] pointed out that [ORG Muatassim  ] clearly played a prominent role , always seated next to his father and attending all of the important meetings . 
4 . 
( C ) As expected , [PER Qadhafi  ] managed to provoke controversy from the start . 
His emerging from his aircraft , his uniform adorned with the picture of [MISC Libyan  ] resistance leader [PER Omar al-Mukhtar  ] in chains in [MISC Italian  ] custody , followed by [PER Mukhtar  ] 's son and other survivors of the [MISC Italian  ] occupation ( 1911-1942 ) set [MISC Italian  ] heads spinning . 
[PER Trupiano  ] said he and the [MISC Italians  ] present knew that the son would be present along with the others but were unaware there would be a pectoral picture . 
5 . 
( C/NF ) In a subsequent discussion with the Ambassador , [PER Trupiano  ] said that PM [PER Berlusconi  ] suffered acute back pain the day of the visit and had asked for a shot of cortisone to help him get dressed . 
That initial shot apparently did little good to alleviate the pain and the [MISC Italians  ] then notified [PER Qadhafi  ] 's plane ( which was circling [LOC Rome  ] airport ) that [PER Berlusconi  ] might not be present at the airport arrival . 
The [MISC Libyans  ] reportedly threatened to cancel the visit if [PER Qadhafi  ] was not met by [PER Berlusconi  ] or President [PER Napolitano  ] ( a non-starter for [MISC Italian  ] protocol given [PER Qadhafi  ] 's lack of equivalent head-of-state title ) . 
At that point , [PER Berlusconi  ] asked for and received a second cortisone shot which enabled him to make the airport arrival , though [PER Trupiano  ] said that several times while waiting , the PM almost collapsed from the intense pain . 
6 . 
( C ) In addition to the [PER Omar  ] al-Mukhtar picture , [PER Qadhafi  ] violated protocol standards by immediately introducing to [PER Berlusconi  ] all of the individuals who also wore pictures around their necks of relatives who had suffered [MISC Italian  ] cruelty or of themselves . 
Each told a brief story to the PM . 
In every venue in which he spoke , [PER Qadhafi  ] referred to the cruelty of the [MISC European  ] ( especially singling out the [MISC Italians  ] and the [MISC French  ] occupation of [LOC Algeria  ] ) colonial period , tailoring his remarks to each audience . 
He noted to his official interlocutors that the [MISC Libyan-Italian  ] rapprochement is one that can be used as a model for other colonial powers who might wish to reconcile and turn a new page with their former colonies . 
[LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000492 002.2 OF 002 7 . 
( C ) During his meeting with President [PER Giorgio Napolitano  ] , [PER Qadhafi  ] reportedly focused on [MISC African  ] issues , noting that with respect to [LOC Eritrea  ] and [LOC Ethiopia  ] , there had been an agreement on the border but that it needed implementation . 
He invited [LOC Italy  ] to work with [LOC Libya  ] to mediate the conflict . 
On [LOC Somalia  ] , [PER Qadhafi  ] reiterated his theme that piracy was caused by international commerce depriving [MISC Somalis  ] of a living by fishing in their waters and argued that [LOC Somalia  ] should have the right to extend its [ORG Exclusive Economic Zone  ] to 200 miles . 
The Leader said [LOC Libya  ] would submit a proposal at the upcoming [ORG UNGA  ] whereby the world would recognize the economic rights of [LOC Somalia  ] and pay a fee for fishing in return for a [MISC Somali  ] effort to end piracy . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] also urged continued reform of the [ORG UNSC  ] to reduce its influence in favor of the [ORG UNGA  ] . 
He also advocated for a permanent [ORG UNSC  ] seat for the [ORG African Union  ] . 
8 . 
( C ) [PER Qadhafi  ] and PM [PER Berlusconi  ] , according to [PER Trupiano  ] , discussed the migration problem , with [PER Qadhafi  ] asserting that there were in fact no real political refugees emerging from the " deserts of [LOC Africa  ] . 
" The vast majority fled for economic reasons and [PER Qadhafi  ] said that as a follow-up to the [MISC EU-Libyan  ] meeting of November 2006 , the [ORG EU  ] should pay [LOC Libya  ] 1 billion euros every year which [LOC Libya  ] would use to help [MISC African  ] nations solve their economic issues which would lead to a solution of the illegal migration issue . 
[LOC Libya  ] , said [PER Qadhafi  ] , is doing its part to resolve this difficult issue between itself and the [ORG EU  ] , especially [LOC Italy  ] ; several government officials and soldiers had been arrested recently for trafficking in illegal migrants . 
9 . 
( C ) Among the agreements signed between the two sides were one on avoiding double taxation , an economic/scientific/technical agreement on marine resources ( [LOC Italy  ] refused to acknowledge [LOC Libya  ] 's effort to have the [MISC Italians  ] recognize [MISC Libyan  ] territorial claims of 74 miles ) , agreement by the [MISC Italians  ] to fund 100 scholarships for [MISC Libyan  ] students , and an [ORG MOU  ] on facilitating the issuance of visas . 
The meeting with [MISC Italian  ] industrialists resulted in a [MISC Libyan  ] pledge to abolish discriminatory practices and to weed out corruption to enable companies to operate better in [LOC Libya  ] . 
10 . 
( C ) [PER Trupiano  ] asserted that the [MISC Italians  ] were extremely embarrassed by [PER Qadhafi  ] 's remarks , and especially angered by those seemingly equating the " state-sponsored terrorism " of the 1986 [LOC U.S.  ] air attacks on [LOC Tripoli  ] and [LOC Benghazi  ] with al-Qaeda 's attacks on 9/11 . 
The Mayor of [LOC Rome  ] affirmed the importance of the [MISC U.S.-Italy  ] relationship and implicitly criticized [PER Qadhafi  ] 's comments . 
That exchange reportedly caused [PER Qadhafi  ] to cancel without official reason the subsequent speech to the [MISC Italian  ] parliamentarians . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] also insisted that he be the only male in the room during his discussion with 700 [MISC Italian  ] women who questioned him on the real status of women in [LOC Libya  ] . 
During a university discussion with students , [PER Qadhafi  ] avoided the hard questions by continually asking " clarifying questions " but never answering . 
11 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment:  ] The [MISC Italians  ] are obviously relieved that the visit , which left [MISC Romans  ] extremely angry at the [MISC Libyans  ] and the government for the massive traffic tie-ups and the expense of hosting the [MISC Libyans  ] , is over . 
[PER Trupiano  ] expressed the hope that while the [MISC Italians  ] had to swallow hard on [PER Qadhafi  ] 's unrelenting mention of the occupation , they believed that perhaps the [MISC Libyans  ] would finally be able to close this chapter and begin a new relationship . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] was clearly taken with the historical import of his trip , making unscheduled stops throughout to see various moments and places connected to the [MISC Italian  ] occupation , including the place from which [ORG Mussolini  ] spoke during his reign . 
According to [PER Trupiano  ] , the [MISC Italians  ] were continuously frustrated by their inability to control [PER Qadhafi  ] 's provocative comments on terrorism , the need to abolish political parties , and on the historical factors which led to female emancipation in the [LOC West  ] . 
At the end of the day , the [MISC Italians  ] here believe that despite the bells and flourishes and announcements of all manner of agreements , that matters will return to normal and there will be little if any implementation or follow-up . 
The [MISC Italians  ] will have another opportunity to experience the [PER Qadhafi  ] roadshow when he visits the [ORG G-8 Summit  ] in July in his capacity as Chairman of the [ORG African Union  ] .
