( C ) [LOC Kazakhstan  ] 's political elites appear to enjoy typical hobbies -- such as travel , horseback riding , and skiing . 
Not surprisingly , however , they are able to indulge in their hobbies on a grand scale , whether flying [PER Elton John  ] to [LOC Kazakhstan  ] for a concert or trading domestic property for a palace in the [LOC United Arab Emirates  ] . 
This cable recounts several instances in which Embassy officers have learned of , or witnessed , the recreational habits of [LOC Kazakhstan  ] 's leaders . 
End Summary. -------------- Sun and Horses -------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) President [PER Nazarbayev  ] , like many of his countrymen , has a strong affinity for horses . 
In 2007 , emboff visited the presidential horse farm with the daughter of the farm 's manager . 
The farm is located on the outskirts of [LOC Astana  ] in a residential area , but is surrounded by a high-fence and security guards . 
Inside the gates are a large stable , indoor and outdoor riding arenas , and a clubhouse with a pool table , sauna , and exercise room . 
Emboff toured the stable and saw approximately forty horses from various parts of the world . 
Emboff 's companion told him that [PER Nazarbayev  ] visits the horse farm on occasion , though not too frequently . 
She said that [PER Nazarbayev  ] 's wife -- [PER Sara Nazarbayeva  ] -- never accompanies him , but claimed that sometimes his " second wife " comes to the horse farm . 
( Comment: Most Kazakhstanis are familiar with the rumor that [PER Nazarbayev  ] has a " second wife , " a former airline stewardess , who is said by some to reside in [LOC London  ] . 
More recently , there have been whispers that [PER Nazarbayev  ] has yet a " third wife , " a former beauty queen . 
We have no concrete information about either relationship , although [MISC Taszhargan  ] , an opposition newspaper , printed a sympathetic article about [PER Sara Nazarbayeva  ] which expounded on her status as [PER Nazarbayev  ] 's " co-wife . 
" End Comment . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Nazarbayev  ] is also fond of traveling to warmer climes in the region . 
The UAE Ambassador told emboff that [PER Nazarbayev  ] had traded property in [LOC Borovoe  ] -- a mountainous resort area of [LOC Kazakhstan  ] north of [LOC Astana  ] and sometimes likened to [LOC Switzerland  ] -- for a " palace " in the [LOC Emirates  ] . 
He did not make clear whether the transaction was a permanent arrangement or only a temporary one . 
The head of [LOC Turkey  ] 's liaison office in [LOC Astana  ] , [PER Orhan Isik  ] , told emboff that [PER Nazarbayev  ] has a mansion in [LOC Antaliya  ] , which he visits 4-5 times a year . 
[PER Isik  ] claimed that [PER Nazarbayev  ] received the property as a gift in the early 1990 's and now plans to use part of the land for the construction of a luxury hotel. ------------------------ Dancing at the Nightclub ------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) On March 7 , two days after his trip to the [LOC U.S.  ] was cancelled , Prime Minister [PER Masimov  ] was spotted by emboff at [ORG Chocolat  ] , one of [LOC Astana  ] 's trendiest nightclubs . 
[PER Masimov  ] entered at approximately 11:30 pm , accompanied by [ORG Presidential Administration  ] head [PER Kairat Kelimbetov  ] , [LOC Astana  ] mayor [PER Askar Mamin  ] , three middle-aged [MISC Kazakh  ] women ( presumably their wives ) , and a security detail . 
Although the club offers a VIP area , [PER Masimov  ] chose to sit at a table in full view of all of the club 's patrons . 
Emboff lingered close to [PER Masimov  ] 's group and saw several bottles of alcohol on the table . 
( [ORG Note: Another  ] emboff had seen the group drinking earlier in the evening at a cigar bar at the [LOC Radisson Hotel  ] , which is located in the same complex as [ORG Chocolat  ] . 
End Note . 
) [PER Masimov  ] led his companions on to [ORG Chocolat  ] 's dance floor soon after their arrival . 
The dance floor holds approximately 100 people , and at the time perhaps 50 patrons were dancing . 
However , [PER Masimov  ] himself chose to dance on an empty stage above the dance floor . 
His companions quickly tired but [PER Masimov  ] remained , dancing alone and animatedly on the stage for another 15-20 minutes . 
At approximately 1:00 am , [PER Masimov  ] and his retinue left the club. ------------------------- Skiing with the [MISC Oligarchs  ] ------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In September 2007 , [PER Kazakhstani  ] oligarch [PER Aleksandr Mashkevich  ] -- the co-founder of metals and mining giant [ORG Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation  ] and , according to [LOC ASTANA  ] 00000760 002.4 OF 003 CLASSIFIED BY POL/ECON CHIEF [PER STEVEN FAGIN  ] , REASONS 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) Forbes magazine , the 334th wealthiest man in the world -- hosted a dinner at his house in [LOC Almaty  ] for two visiting [LOC U.S.  ] congressmen . 
Only two Kazakhstanis attended the event , State Secretary [PER Kanat Saudabayev  ] and his assistant . 
Judging from SIPDIS the friendly banter between [PER Saudabayev  ] and [PER Mashkevich  ] , the two have a quite cordial personal relationship . 
[PER Mashkevich  ] told a lengthy anecdote about a ski vacation that he and [PER Saudabayev  ] had taken together in [LOC Europe.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Saudabayev  ] had hosted a codel at that same [LOC Almaty  ] residence in 2005 , without [PER Mashkevich  ] in attendance . 
At that time , when the Ambassador asked [PER Saudabayev  ] whose house it was , he would only say that it belonged to " a friend . 
" [PER Saudabayev  ] has twice hosted visiting USG officials for a meal at [PER Mashkevich  ] 's [LOC Astana  ] residence -- both times without [PER Mashkevich  ] . 
It is not clear what [PER Mashkevich  ] is spending his billions on , but it is certainly not culinary talent . 
On all four occasions the Ambassador has eaten at one of his houses , the menu has been similar and focused on beshparmak ( boiled meat and noodles ) and plov . 
The wait staff appeared to be graduates of a [MISC Soviet  ] cafeteria training academy . 
The wine , at least , was somewhat upscale with reasonably good [MISC French  ] vintage bottles uncorked for the guests . 
The [LOC Astana  ] residence has wooden plaques on the doors that would fit in nicely in a [LOC Wyoming  ] hunting lodge but are somewhat out of touch with the upscale " [MISC Euro-remont  ] " that is so popular among the [PER Kazakhstani  ] elite. ------------------------------- Private Concerts with the Stars ------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In 2007 , President [PER Nazarbayev  ] 's son-in-law , [PER Timur Kulibayev  ] , celebrated his 41st birthday in grand style . 
At a small venue in [LOC Almaty  ] , he hosted a private concert with some of [LOC Russia  ] 's biggest pop-stars . 
The headliner , however , was [PER Elton John  ] , to whom he reportedly paid one million pounds for this one-time appearance . 
( [PER Note:  ] The [MISC British  ] Ambassador relayed a slightly different story , with an unknown but obviously well-heeled friend arranging and paying for Sir [PER Elton  ] 's gig . 
End Comment . 
) There have been separate reports that [PER Nelly Furtado  ] performed at the August 2007 birthday bash for [PER Kulibayev  ] 's wife , [PER Dinara Nazarbayeva  ] . 
[PER Kulibayev  ] also appears willing to spend his fortune on others . 
According to [MISC Turkish  ] diplomat [PER Isik  ] , when the [MISC Kempinski  ] group recently built luxury villas in [LOC Bodrum  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] , [PER Kulibayev  ] bought up a number of them -- at a cost of 4-5 million dollars each -- and doled them out as gifts to friends and family. ----------------------- Sports and [ORG Politics Mix  ] ----------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Sports and politics mixed seamlessly in [LOC Almaty  ] on April 2 , when some of [LOC Kazakhstan  ] 's most prominent political figures participated in the [LOC Beijing  ] [MISC Olympics  ] torch relay . 
Torchbearers included President [PER Nazarbayev  ] , [ORG Presidential Administration  ] business affairs head [PER Bolat Utemuratov  ] , [ORG Nur Otan  ] party first deputy chairman [PER Adilbek Dzhaksybekov  ] , and Agency for the [ORG Regulation of Natural Monopolies  ] head [PER Mazhit Yesenbayev  ] . 
All of these bigwigs , except [PER Nazarbayev  ] himself , could justify their participation in the relay based not on their high-ranking political offices , but rather on their prominent official positions in the [PER Kazakhstani  ] sports world . 
Utemeratov just happens to head [LOC Kazakhstan  ] 's [ORG Tennis Federation  ] , while Dzhakysbekov chairs the [ORG Football Federation  ] -- a position previously held by ex-Nazarbayev son-in-law [PER Rakhat Aliyev  ] . 
[PER Yesenbayev  ] heads the [ORG Judo Federation  ] . 
[ORG KazMunayGaz  ] chairman [PER Uzakbay Karabalin  ] , who heads the [ORG Boxing Federation  ] , and [PER Nazarbayev  ] son-in-law [PER Timur Kulibayev  ] , who heads the [ORG Golf Federation  ] , also shared in the glory of carrying the [MISC Olympic  ] torch . 
One prominent sport federation president who missed the torch call was Defense Minister [PER Daniyal Akhmetov  ] . 
He is head of the scandal-ridden [ORG Cycling Federation  ] that sponsored a team in last year 's [MISC Tour de France  ] which flunked the drug test. ----------------------------------- Relaxation the [LOC Good  ] , Old [MISC Soviet  ] Way ----------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [LOC Kazakhstan  ] 's political elites also have recreational tastes that are not so exotic . 
Some , in fact , prefer to relax the old-fashioned way . 
Defense Minister [PER Akhmetov  ] , a self-proclaimed workaholic , appears to enjoy loosening up in the tried and true " homo sovieticus " style -- i.e. , drinking [LOC ASTANA  ] 00000760 003.4 OF 003 CLASSIFIED BY POL/ECON CHIEF [PER STEVEN FAGIN  ] , REASONS 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) oneself into a stupor . 
While most of our accounts of [PER Akhmetov  ] 's indulgences with the bottle are hearsay , we do have " eyes on " for one episode which supports the rumors . 
In June 2007 , [PER Akhmetov  ] showed up in grand form for a meeting with a visiting senior [ORG U.S. Defense Department  ] official . 
Making no attempt to conceal his condition -- slouching back in his chair and slurring all kinds of [MISC Russian  ] participles -- [PER Akhmetov  ] explained to this very senior guest that he had just been at a cadet graduation reception " toasting [LOC Kazakhstan  ] 's newly-commissioned officers . 
" Who was toasted more -- the Defense Minister or the cadets -- is a matter of pure speculation . 
[PER Akhmetov  ] 's excesses do not solely extend to the bottle . 
An insider at [LOC Astana  ] 's [ORG Radisson Hotel  ] recently told us about preparations for the unbelievably lavish and expensive wedding of [PER Akhmetov  ] 's son . 
In the [MISC Kazakh  ] tradition , the parents of the groom are responsible for the wedding -- so it would seem that [PER Akhmetov  ] must have footed the bill .
