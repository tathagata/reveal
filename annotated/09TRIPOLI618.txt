BACK WHERE WE STARTED 2 . 
( C ) As previously reported in Ref A , as of a few months ago , it appeared the [ORG GOL  ] was committed to allowing [ORG Caterpillar  ] ( " [MISC CAT  ] " ) heavy machinery and spare parts to enter [LOC Libya  ] . 
Until now , [MISC CAT  ] products have been entering the country , but recent events indicate that a previous ban on [ORG CAT imports  ] may be reinstated . 
Previously , as a condition of lifting the ban , [ORG CAT had  ] severed all business ties with its [MISC Libyan  ] agent ( [ORG Sahil Company  ] ) . 
[ORG CAT  ] was forced to take this step in order to overcome accusations made by the Secretary of Industry , [ORG Economy and Trade ( Ministry of Economy-equivalent  ] ) that the [ORG CAT dealership  ] was operating illegally and corruptly , as its [MISC Libyan  ] partners were the sons of current government officials . 
The Secretary referenced Article 5 of the General People 's [MISC Committee Decision No.  ] 315 of 2008 on Regulations Regarding Commercial Agencies ( distributorships ) , which prohibit distributors to partner with government officials . 
Once [ORG CAT  ] severed its ties to the [ORG Sahil Company  ] , the [ORG GOL  ] lifted the ban on May 3 , and [ORG CAT equipment  ] was once again allowed to flow into [LOC Libya  ] . 
Even though the [ORG GOL  ] said it would not tell [ORG CAT who  ] its partner must be , the [ORG GOL  ] rejected [ORG CAT 's  ] proposed new partner and has mandated that [ORG CAT 's  ] dealer in [LOC Tripoli  ] be the state-owned [ORG Economic and Social Development Fund  ] ( [ORG ESDF  ] ) . 
[ORG CAT agreed  ] to allow the [ORG ESDF  ] to hold a 40 percent share in the dealership , but the [ORG ESDF  ] , promptly rejecting [ORG CAT 's  ] offer , insisted on 100 percent ownership . 
[ORG CAT representatives  ] traveled to [LOC Tripoli  ] the week of July 12 to meet with [ORG GOL  ] officials and negotiate a settlement before the July 15 deadline imposed by the [ORG GOL  ] . 
While the July 15 deadline has come and gone without GOL-imposition of a new ban , negotiations have reached an impasse , and a ban may be reimposed at any time and without notice . 
PERSPECTIVE OF CAT'S TUNISIAN REPRESENTATIVE: [ORG PARENIN  ] 3 . 
( C/NF ) On July 12 , [PER Mohamed El Fadhel Khalil  ] , the [MISC Tunis-based  ] Managing Director of [ORG Parenin Company  ] , [ORG CAT 's  ] partner in [LOC North Africa  ] , briefed the Ambassador on [ORG CAT 's  ] efforts to quickly renegotiate its representation in [LOC Libya  ] , particularly in light of the July 15 deadline . 
After severing its relationship with the [MISC Libyan  ] company , [PER Sahil  ] , [ORG CAT asked  ] the [ORG GPC  ] for Industry , [ORG Economy  ] and Trade ( [ORG GPCIET  ] ) for a short-list of possible new partners . 
Secretary [PER Mohammed Ali  ] al-Hweij declined to give a list , saying it would constitute an act of " corruption . 
" [ORG CAT then  ] contacted other [MISC Libyan  ] businessmen and negotiated with one of them to manage the [LOC Tripoli  ] dealership and for another to manage the dealership in [LOC Benghazi  ] . 
The [ORG GOL  ] rejected the proposal , recommending instead that [ORG ESDF  ] be the sole owner of the [LOC Tripoli  ] dealership , while a private company could manage the [LOC Benghazi  ] dealership . 
[PER Khalil  ] noted that while [ORG CAT would  ] prefer to work only with the private sector , it would accept a deal in which [ORG ESDF  ] held a portion of the dealership ( up to 40 percent ) but not 100 percent . 
[ORG ESDF  ] rejected [ORG CAT 's  ] counter-offer . 
4 . 
( C/NF ) [ORG ESDF  ] 's interest in the [ORG CAT dealership  ] remains unclear . 
[PER Khalil  ] said [ORG CAT 's  ] annual sales in 2008 ( prior to the import ban ) amounted to 38 million USD . 
He suspects that the [ORG ESDF  ] incorrectly believes [ORG CAT 's  ] sales figures to be much higher , on the order of 300 million [MISC USD.  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx [PER Khalil  ] asked the Ambassador to raise the [MISC CAT  ] issue with the [ORG Qadafhi TRIPOLI  ] 00000618 002.2 OF 003 sons , particularly with [PER Muatassim  ] in his capacity as a government official. xxxxxxxxxxxx [PER Khalil  ] said [ORG CAT 's  ] competitors , such as the [MISC Koreans  ] , [MISC Chinese  ] , [MISC British  ] , etc. , are allowed to sell their products in [LOC Libya  ] with few problems . 
However , in his view , they do not provide the same level of customer service as [ORG CAT provides  ] . 
He was not aware of any other cases of the [ORG ESDF  ] owning a 100 percent stake in a similar dealership . 
[ Note: In a separate conversation with the [ORG Volkswagen  ] dealer in [LOC Tripoli  ] - a private , [MISC Libyan-owned  ] company - Econoff learned that the [ORG ESDF  ] moved about a year and a half ago to take 30 percent of the shares of private automobile dealerships operating in [LOC Libya  ] , for the ostensible purpose of redistributing those shares to poor [MISC Libyan  ] families . 
The companies refused and have not been approached again . 
However , the [MISC Libyan  ] Stock Exchange is moving forward in implementing a program in which poor [MISC Libyan  ] families will receive stocks in ESDF-owned companies as part of a government program to widen ownership in government companies ( Ref B ) .

] [ORG CAT MEETS  ] WITH ECONOMY AND TRADE OFFICIALS.. . 
5 . 
( C ) During a July 13 meeting with [PER Andrew Sheridan  ] , of [MISC CAT  ] 's [LOC Middle East  ] regional office , and Acting Senior Commercial Officer [PER Nate Mason  ] , [ORG GPCIET  ] Secretary [PER Mohammed Ali  ] al-Hweij explained that partners from [LOC Tunisia  ] , [LOC Malta  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] or [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] were unacceptable in any potential [MISC CAT  ] dealership even as managers or agents but that " [MISC European  ] and [MISC American  ] " partners were acceptable . 
He also said [MISC CAT  ] could work with [ORG ESDF  ] on the [LOC Tripoli  ] dealership and partner with other [MISC Libyan  ] entities on the [LOC Benghazi  ] portion . 
[ Note: [MISC CAT  ] has told us this would likely be a non-starter as the company expects the [LOC Benghazi  ] dealership to outperform an ESDF-connected [LOC Tripoli  ] dealership , simply based on projected sales ; if this happened , the [ORG GOL  ] would most likely shut down the [LOC Benghazi  ] operation . 
End note . 
] [PER Hweij  ] claimed that the [ORG ESDF  ] is a private sector company , " 100 percent " unrelated to the [ORG GOL  ] , and that [MISC CAT  ] could negotiate with [ORG ESDF  ] like it would with any other private firm . 
[ Note: The [ORG ESDF  ] answers directly to the General People 's Committee which is the [MISC Libyan  ] equivalent of the prime minister 's cabinet and is clearly a government entity . 
End note . 
] ...AND GETS STONE-WALLED BY THE ECONOMIC AND [ORG SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT FUND  ] 6 . 
( C ) On July 14 , [PER Sheridan  ] met with [PER Hamed Hoderi  ] , Head of [ORG ESDF  ] . 
[PER Hoderi  ] reiterated [ORG ESDF  ] 's insistence on 100 percent ownership of the [MISC CAT  ] dealership without negotiation . 
According to [PER Hoderi  ] , the [MISC European  ] " partners " mentioned by [PER Hweij  ] would be limited to management functions with no ownership rights . 
[PER Hoderi  ] indicated that the [ORG GOL  ] and [ORG ESDF  ] planned to use the [MISC CAT  ] deal as a template for all other heavy equipment and auto dealerships . 
[PER Hoderi  ] repeatedly pressed [MISC CAT  ] for a quick decision , which [PER Sheridan  ] understood to be an implied threat to reinstate the ban on [MISC CAT  ] imports . 
THROWING THE RAILROAD PROJECT INTO THE MIX 7 . 
( C ) If a ban is reinstated , [MISC CAT  ] stands to lose as much as 40 million USD . 
[MISC CAT  ] has negotiated a 30 million USD deal with [ORG Russian Railways Company  ] to provide equipment for their railroad construction project along the coast from [LOC Sirte  ] to [LOC Benghazi  ] , a deal that hinges on a guarantee that [MISC CAT  ] equipment is allowed to enter the country . 
[MISC CAT  ] is also expecting orders totaling 7-8 million USD to enter [LOC Libya  ] over the next few months . 
On July 20 , [PER Sheridan  ] reported that the [ORG GPCIET  ] official [PER Dia Hammouda  ] , told him the only way to guarantee this would be to conclude the deal with [ORG ESDF  ] - another indication of the [ORG GOL  ] 's reinstatement of the import ban . 
Barring a compromise by [ORG ESDF  ] to allow for a true partnership , [MISC CAT  ] expects to have to exit the [MISC Libyan  ] market , at which point [MISC CAT  ] expects the [ORG GOL  ] to reinstate the import ban . 
[MISC CAT  ] is now planning to change its strategy from negotiating a solution to one of damage control in response to a potential import ban . 
8 . 
( C ) Comment: At this juncture , it appears that [MISC CAT  ] will pull out of [LOC Libya  ] altogether , and the [ORG GOL  ] is likely to reimpose its [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000618 003.2 OF 003 previous ban on [MISC CAT  ] imports . 
While the [ORG USG  ] may not be able to influence the outcome of [MISC CAT  ] 's negotiations on a dealership , we can make the [ORG GOL  ] aware of the multitude of problems that would result from the imposition of discriminatory market access barriers . 
Moreover , a decision to ban [MISC CAT  ] equipment will go against [ORG GOL  ] interests - many construction companies ( of various nationalities ) are depending on [MISC CAT  ] equipment to complete infrastructure projects on time , particularly in the lead up to pageantry planned for the 40th Anniversary of [PER Qadhafi  ] 's coup September 1 . 
However , as we have seen in this most recent series of meetings in [LOC Tripoli  ] , the decisions affecting [ORG CAT  ] 's future are clearly being made several levels above the Secretary of Industry , Economy and Trade , perhaps by the [PER Qadhafi  ] sons . 
The [ORG GOL  ] 's treatment of [MISC CAT  ] demonstrates why a [ORG TIFA  ] is badly needed to defend the rights and interests of the private sector in [LOC Libya  ] .
