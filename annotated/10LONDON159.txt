<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 [LOC LONDON  ] 000159 NOFORN SIPDIS FOR THE SECRETARY FROM AMBASSADOR SUSMAN EO 12958 DECL: 01/22/2020 [PER TAGS MARR  ] , [LOC MOPS  ] , [LOC PGOV  ] , [LOC PREL  ] , [LOC UK  ] , [LOC AF  ] , PK SUBJECT: SCENESETTER: YOUR VISIT TO [LOC LONDON  ] JANUARY 27-29 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Louis Susman  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C/NF ) SUMMARY: We are delighted to welcome you back to [LOC London  ] for the conferences on [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Yemen  ] this week . 
PM [PER Brown  ] is our strong ally on both issues , despite some early difficulties in coordinating conference details with us , especially in regard to [LOC Yemen  ] . 
He assured me that they were mistakes made “in good faith” and that his team is now sensitized to the need for close consultation . 
[PER Brown  ] genuinely wants the [LOC Afghanistan  ] conference to result in substantial movement on our agenda with [LOC Kabul  ] and the international community . 
But he also likely hopes to burnish his image as a world leader with the [MISC British  ] voting public . 
[LOC UK  ] general elections must take place by June ( most believe they will be held on May 6 ) . 
With his [ORG Labour  ] party trailing in the polls by some 10 to 13 points , [PER Brown  ] faces an uphill battle . 
But it will be a battle largely on domestic issues ; [LOC Afghanistan  ] is not the lightening rod for [ORG Labour  ] that [LOC Iraq  ] was in the UK’s 2005 polls . 
Though public support is tepid , the opposition [MISC Conservatives  ] support [LOC UK  ] military involvement and will continue to do so. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) Your visit is an opportunity to underscore the importance of progress in [LOC Afghanistan  ] to international security and demonstrate the continuing value of the [MISC U.S.-UK  ] “special relationship.” Your personal involvement in [LOC Northern Ireland  ] issues is well-known ; [PER Shaun Woodward  ] is looking forward to discussing the latest developments with you . 
My staff very much appreciates that you have set aside valuable time to meet them ; the Embassy team is really looking forward to it . 
I also suggest you tape a segmant for the widely-viewed [PER Andrew Marr  ] Sunday morning show . 
END SUMMARY . 
[LOC UK  ] Gearing Up for Elections --------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) Our contacts are confident PM [PER Brown  ] will call for [LOC UK  ] general elections on May 6 , the same day as local elections are already scheduled . 
PM [PER Brown  ] easily survived an early January challenge to his [ORG Labour  ] leadership by a few disgruntled MPs , but it highlighted party divisions and weakened his standing in the polls . 
Those divisions remain , and have , on occasion , caused a disconnect between the [ORG Foreign Office  ] and the Prime Minister’s office . 
However , while the election will largely be fought on domestic issues , ( [PER Brown  ] is touting his leadership in preventing an economic meltdown and restoring growth ) , the pre-election atmosphere affects the approach of both major parties to global challenges -- and their relationship with us. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) Since [ORG Labour  ] and the [MISC Conservatives  ] largely agree on the importance of continued [LOC UK  ] engagement in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , electoral differences over foreign policy will appear on two fronts: history and resources . 
Public hearings in the on-going inquiry into the UK’s highly unpopular involvement in [LOC Iraq  ] have bitten [ORG Labour  ] hard as members of the [PER Brown  ] government defend their decisions under former PM [PER Blair  ] ( [PER Blair  ] is expected to appear before the public inquiry January 29 ) . 
PM [PER Brown  ] has volunteered to appear himself prior to elections to defend his own decisions on resources and his advice to [PER Blair  ] while [ORG Chancellor of the  ] Exchequer under [PER Blair  ] . 
Resources for foreign affairs and defense will be an electoral theme , as [MISC Conservatives  ] promise unspecified budget cuts to reduce the deficit . 
Both parties are committed to increasing official development assistance to 0.7% of GDP -- in line with the [MISC Millenium  ] development goals . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] will remain a major focus of assistance ; under a [MISC Conservative  ] government that could even increase . 
But since both parties accept the need for deficit reduction , funds will likely be scarcer for all projects -- defense or civilian -- in coming years . 
Both [ORG Labour  ] and [MISC Conservative  ] leaders agree on the need for a [ORG Strategic Defense Review  ] , shortly after the election , to analyze defense priorities and to match resources to these priorities . 
Foreign Police Priorities as Elections Approach --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] are key priorities for PM [PER Brown  ] . 
Despite tepid public support , [PER Brown  ] pledged additional troops ahead of the President’s December announcement ( which [PER Brown  ] strongly welcomed ) . 
[PER Brown  ] is open about the fact that he would like other [ORG NATO  ] allies and the [LOC LONDON  ] 00000159 002 OF 002 [MISC Afghans  ] to assume a greater share of combat operations , stressing that the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC UK  ] and a handful of others have borne the brunt of the fighting . 
[PER Brown  ] and his close advisors view the January 28 [ORG London Conference  ] as a venue for [PER Karzai  ] to confirm the pledges he made in his inaugural address and to provide momentum to international efforts to support [MISC Afghan  ] stability . 
[PER Brown  ] also proved flexible on his original candidate for NATO’s senior civilian administrator , making our preferred candidate available. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) In our recent conversation , PM [PER Brown  ] acknowledged early mis-steps over the [LOC Yemen  ] conference -- but since then we have coordinated closely on our goals and objectives . 
There is no formal agenda for the two-hour meeting on January 27 . 
PM [PER Brown  ] plans to give opening remarks , followed by the [MISC Yemeni  ] PM . 
Foreign Secretary [PER Miliband  ] will then take over . 
Discussion will be based on three themes: shared analysis of the challenges , political and economic reform , and improved donor coordination . 
FM [PER Miliband  ] is hosting a lunch for [ORG GCC  ] members prior to the meeting . 
He hopes [ORG GCC  ] members will deliver the difficult messages on reform that he fears they will not want to deliver in front of the larger group. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) On other foreign policy issues , our close cooperation continues . 
The [LOC UK  ] agrees with our approach on [LOC Iran  ] sanctions , shares our commitment to a robust counterterrorism agenda , and supports our non-proliferation objectives ( [PER U/S Tauscher  ] will hold consultations with the [MISC Pakistanis  ] in [LOC London  ] on February 1 ) . 
The government’s commitment to the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process is behind its efforts to ensure that universal jurisdiction concerns are addressed so that [MISC Israeli  ] officials can travel to the [LOC UK  ] . 
The [LOC UK  ] government has made stabilizing [LOC Somalia  ] a priority and recently increased its programming to GBP 35 million ( USD 56 million ) . 
In addition , the [LOC UK  ] works closely with us on [LOC Nigeria  ] , the [LOC Democratic Republic  ] of [LOC Congo  ] , and [LOC Zimbabwe.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) PM [PER Brown  ] may take the opportunity to discuss [LOC Northern Ireland  ] with you during your visit ; he appreciates your personal involvement . 
At the moment , the situation is in flux ; we expect a clearer view within 48 hours . 
[PER Brown  ] has pressed hard for renewed progress on devolution of policing and justice . 
You will also have an opportunity to review progress with [LOC Brown’s  ] [LOC Northern Ireland  ] minister [PER Shaun Woodward  ] during your stay . 
As we write , the situation is fluid , with the two sides meeting on Monday in [LOC Belfast  ] , and PM [PER Brown  ] meeting PM Cowan in [LOC London  ] . 
Public Diplomacy ---------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) On the public diplomacy side , I hope you can take some time out to tape an interview with leading [MISC British  ] journalist [PER Andrew Marr  ] , to be broadcast on his Sunday morning [ORG BBC  ] TV talk show . 
The program , which reaches 1.5 million live and millions more on the web , is essential weekend viewing for [LOC Britain  ] , often setting the week’s news and political agenda for the nation . 
The program could be taped at your hotel , at my residence or at the [ORG BBC  ] studios in [LOC West London  ] . 
It would be a powerful way for you to set out our priorities for [MISC Afghanistan/Pakistan  ] , and underline our premier partnership with the [LOC United Kingdom  ] . 
[PER Marr  ] is a congenial and knowlegable interviewer who will offer maximum impact for your investment of time .
