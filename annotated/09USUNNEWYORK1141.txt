<code><pre>Monday , 21 December 2009 , 11:24 C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 04 USUN [LOC NEW YORK  ] 001141 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 12/11/2019 TAGS PHUM , [LOC PREL  ] , [LOC UNGA  ] , [LOC US  ] , [LOC XG  ] , XT SUBJECT: UNGA64: [ORG EU  ] AND EFTA MEMBER STATES WELCOME AND SUPPORT NEW [LOC U.S.  ] PRIORITIES: REPORT PREPARED BY AREA ADVISOR FOR WESTERN EUROPE ROBERT SMOLIK Classified By: Ambassador [PER Rosemary DiCarlo  ] for reasons 1.4 ( d ) SUMMARY AND INTRODUCTION <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) The [ORG EU-27  ] responded to new [LOC U.S.  ] flexibility at UNGA64 by collaborating pragmatically on our top priorities , and by providing essential voting support . 
Ably led by Sweden’s [ORG EU  ] presidency , [ORG EU  ] member states shared the burden on lobbying the [MISC G-77  ] regarding human rights resolutions . 
They stood firm against [MISC G-77  ] ideology on economic/social resolutions , notably voting No on the Right to Development , and voting No with us on the trade resolution , for only the second time at [LOC UNGA.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) Despite differences with us over the [ORG Freedom of Expression  ] resolution , [ORG EU  ] states contributed to a more positive outcome on the [ORG Defamation of Religions  ] resolution . 
They also attempted to moderate the language of [MISC Palestinian  ] resolutions . 
The [ORG EU  ] split over the [ORG Goldstone  ] report resolution , ( 5 [ORG Yes-7 No-15 Abstain  ] ) primarily because of [MISC Dutch  ] insistence on clear principles. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) While enthusiastic about new [LOC U.S.  ] flexibility on disarmament and non-proliferation , [LOC Germany  ] complicated eventual consensus on the [ORG Arms Transfer Treaty  ] and [LOC France  ] continues to question total disarmament . 
On [LOC Cuba  ] , the [ORG EU  ] as a whole and [LOC Spain  ] in particular remained critical of our policy . 
Overall , [LOC Spain  ] stood out for its influence within the [ORG EU  ] and in [LOC Latin America  ] , and The [LOC Netherlands  ] for its principled , helpful stance on [ORG Goldstone  ] and the [LOC Palestine  ] resolutions. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) EFTA country delegations played influential niche roles: Switzerland’s [LOC PR  ] ably chaired the budget committee ; Liechtenstein’s [LOC PR  ] led the [ORG ICC  ] assembly of states parties ; and Norway’s proposed pragmatic follow-up to [LOC U.S.  ] initiatives on combating violence against women in conflicts . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] observer was as always active and influential behind the scenes . 
Although budget committee business is not yet complete , the large contributors from the [LOC Eurozone  ] have shown welcome budget discipline and have pledged not to re-open the issue of the [LOC U.S  ] budget cap. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( SBU ) Looking ahead to [LOC UNGA65  ] , the [ORG WEOG  ] quietly chose its candidate for President of that General Assembly , to be formally elected by the [LOC GA  ] in June 2010: [PER Joseph Deiss  ] , former President of the [LOC Swiss Confederation  ] . 
[PER Deiss  ] is a consensus-builder and should preside efficiently , discretely , and impartially. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Also looking forward to [LOC UNGA65  ] , [ORG EU  ] delegations at the [ORG UN  ] ( and in other international organizations ) are moving deliberately towards an enhanced observer status , based on the [ORG Lisbon Treaty  ] mandate , whereby the [ORG EU  ] would speak early and authoritatively for the 27 in all [ORG UN  ] debates . 
How such a new dynamic would affect [LOC U.S.  ] interests at the [ORG UN  ] and beyond , and how other regional groupings ( AU , Caricom ) might react , are important future issues . 
To encourage the [ORG EU-27  ] to continue as our core supporters at [LOC UNGA65  ] , we should engage them in early and energetic consultations on our [LOC UNGA65  ] agenda . 
END SUMMARY STRONG [MISC SWEDISH  ] [ORG EU  ] PRESIDENCY <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) Led by an organized and pragmatic [PER Sweden-EU Presidency  ] delegation , the 27 [ORG EU  ] member states worked collaboratively and productively with us on our major UNGA64 objectives . 
They responded with alacrity to new [LOC U.S.  ] flexibility , particularly on arms control and economic/social issues . 
Compared to [MISC UNGA62  ] and 63 , they committed and delivered a higher level of cooperation , which led to better results for traditional “WEOG” interests , particularly on human rights resolutions and on other “rights” issues. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The [ORG EU  ] lobbied energetically for the three key country-specific human rights resolutions ( [LOC Burma  ] , [LOC DPRK  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , of which they ran the first two ) . 
The [MISC Swedish  ] presidency helped to organize and implement a burdensharing campaign that was more comprehensive , systematic , and synergistic than in previous UNGAs . 
[ORG EU  ] lobbying efforts mobilized permanent representatives and other senior diplomats , not only third committee experts . 
The [MISC Swedish  ] Ambassador himself repeatedly engaged with [MISC G-77  ] colleagues to sway votes. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [ORG EU  ] failed to achieve their desired consensus to USUN NEW Y 00001141 002 OF 004 vote together in favor of or to abstain on the [ORG Goldstone Report  ] resolution , primarily because The [LOC Netherlands  ] demanded a clear position of principle against endorsement of the report . 
As a result , the [ORG EU  ] split , with [LOC Cyprus  ] , [LOC Ireland  ] , [LOC Malta  ] , [LOC Portugal  ] , and [LOC Slovenia  ] voting Yes while [LOC Czech Republic  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC Hungary  ] , [LOC Italy  ] , The [LOC Netherlands  ] , [LOC Poland  ] , and [LOC Slovakia  ] joined the [LOC U.S.  ] in voting [MISC No. The  ] other 15 abstained. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [MISC EU’s  ] traditional negotiation with the [MISC Palestinian  ] observer delegation over its [LOC Israel  ] resolutions improved slightly in dynamic , but not in outcome . 
Although the [ORG EU  ] succeeded in moderating some of these draft resolutions , the overall voting outcomes remained overwhelmingly against the [LOC U.S.  ] position . 
The [ORG EU  ] did help to build bridges to moderate [MISC Arab  ] states on [MISC Israel’s  ] technical agriculture resolution , but the [MISC Arab  ] group nonetheless called a vote on the resolution and pressured [ORG OIC  ] and [MISC African  ] [ORG NAM  ] members to join in abstaining . 
[ORG SPECIFIC COMMITTEE  ] NEGOTIATIONS <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) On [ORG Fourth Committee  ] issues dealing with decolonization , [LOC France  ] and the [LOC U.K.  ] were strong partners . 
However , their influence within the [ORG EU  ] caucus at the [ORG UN  ] on [LOC Palestine  ] resolutions was not as positive as we expected and hoped . 
[MISC Sweden-EU Presidency  ] helped substantially with the [LOC Palestine  ] resolutions , enforcing efficiency in [ORG EU  ] consultations and briefing [ORG WEOG  ] members on the outcome of the [MISC EU’s  ] negotiations . 
The [MISC EU’s  ] annual negotiation of these nine drafts ( four [ORG UNRWA  ] and five on the special rights of the [MISC Palestinians  ] ) improved marginally , but it was [MISC Dutch  ] insistence of a strongly-worded [ORG EU  ] explanation of vote against the inclusion of politicized terms like “blockade” and “collective punishment” that had the most impact on the [ORG Fourth Committee  ] deliberation of these resolutions . 
The vote outcomes remained lopsided. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) On other [ORG Third Committee  ] resolutions , particularly Right to [LOC Food  ] , Rights of the Child , Right to Development , [ORG EU  ] member states warmly welcomed our new flexibility ( particularly on the former resolution ) and stood firm against [MISC G-77  ] excesses ( surprisingly voting No as a bloc against the latter resolution ) . 
There was spontaneous applause in committee when the [LOC U.S.  ] joined consensus on the Right to [LOC Food  ] for the first time ever , and on Rights of the Child for the first time in a decade. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) On Second Committee issues the [ORG EU  ] was as frustrated as we were regarding the disconnect between positions taken by large [MISC G-77  ] nations at the [ORG UN  ] and diverging commitments they had undertaken in the [MISC G-20  ] . 
However , preferring to see a glass half full , several [ORG EU  ] Ambassadors said that this “schizophrenia” would eventually improve second committee economic resolutions , but that this would take time . 
The [ORG EU  ] joined us for the second time ever at [ORG UNGA  ] by casting 27 No votes on the trade resolution . 
A [MISC Norwegian  ] diplomat was key facilitator in those negotiations , which came close to bridging the gap between [MISC US/EU  ] positions and the [MISC G-77’s.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) On [ORG First Committee  ] , the [ORG Arms Transfer Treaty  ] ( [ORG ATT  ] ) resolution ran into determined opposition from [LOC Germany  ] ( and [LOC Mexico  ] ) . 
Germany’s argument was that a consensus on the [ORG ATT  ] would yield a “lowest common denominator” weak outcome . 
The [LOC U.K.  ] sided with us as we called for language supporting a consensus-based approach to [ORG ATT  ] negotiations . 
The [MISC Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty  ] resolution also for the first time achieved consensus , with support and acclaim from key [MISC European  ] players for [LOC U.S.  ] willingness to do so . 
Overall , [ORG EU  ] support for new [LOC U.S.  ] flexibility on non-proliferation and disarmament was strong . 
Key [MISC Europeans  ] helped us lobby third parties. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) During UNGA64 , the [ORG EU  ] worked closely with us on the trade resolution . 
Negotiators , led by a [MISC Norwegian  ] trade expert , nearly agreed on draft language with the [MISC G-77  ] . 
Unfortunately , given realities of the [LOC Doha Round  ] , both we and the [ORG EU  ] voted [MISC No. There  ] was little difference in [MISC European  ] dynamics on the [LOC MDG  ] debate compared to previous UNGAs . 
In the lead-up to the [ORG Copenhagen Climate Change Conference  ] , most of the [ORG UN  ] negotiations proceeded away from [LOC NY  ] , despite Secretary [PER General’s Ban Ki-moon’s  ] repeated references to the issue . 
Nevertheless , Denmark’s [LOC PR  ] worked diligently to prepare modalities for the [LOC MDG  ] , biodiversity and associated high-level events that will open UNGA65. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) Extra-EU support for our initiatives on preventing violence against women in armed conflicts came from [LOC Norway  ] . 
The [LOC PR  ] brought his national chief of police to the [ORG UN  ] for a consciousness-raising session that proposed and sought USUN NEW Y 00001141 003 OF 004 practical programs to address the issue . 
Belgium’s [LOC PR  ] also hosted a side-event on this issue and is looking for [LOC U.S.  ] engagement . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] observer mission lobbied actively and influentially in the corridors and in informal consultations , particularly on social issues , especially on the [ORG Defamation of Religions  ] resolution , where they are allies . 
Their long-term view of this issue coincides with ours: the trend is positive. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On the downside , during the [LOC Cuba  ] debate relating to our trade embargo and other [LOC U.S.  ] bilateral policies , the [ORG EU  ] showed no change in its firm stand against extraterritoriality provisions of the embargo . 
[LOC Spain  ] was a particularly tenacious critic of our [LOC Cuba  ] policy. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) In Fourth ( decolonization ) [ORG Committee France  ] and the [LOC UK  ] generally were strong partners . 
However , their influence within the [ORG EU  ] caucus at the [ORG UN  ] on [LOC Palestine  ] was not as positive what we had hoped . 
The [MISC Swedish  ] [ORG EU  ] Presidency helped substantially with the [ORG UNRWA  ] resolutions . 
The [MISC EU’s  ] traditional negotiation of nine drafts on [LOC Palestine  ] resolutions ( 4 on [ORG UNRWA  ] and five on Special Rights of [LOC Palestinain People  ] ) improved marginally in tone and objectivity from previous years . 
Also of initial concern , [ORG EU  ] working-level negotiators suggested unhelpful amendments to the [LOC U.S.  ] cybersecurity resolution , adding extraneous , questionable references ( e.g. , to [MISC MDGs  ] ) . 
Once the matter was raised at [LOC PR  ] level , the [ORG EU  ] lined up behind our resolution as drafted. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The legal affairs committee’s resolutions , invariably adopted by consensus , featured like-minded cooperation between [ORG EU  ] legal experts and [LOC U.S.  ] counterparts . 
However , we would have appreciated more active [MISC European  ] support on important points of principle in the negotiations of the [MISC Comprehensive Convention  ] on [ORG International Terrorism  ] and on the [MISC Russian  ] sanction paper preserving [ORG Security Council  ] prerogatives , but they were silent . 
Although not formally part of the [ORG UN  ] legal affairs committee’s work , the [ORG ICC  ] is often staffed and led by legal officers who overlap with [ORG UN  ] business , notably the [LOC PR  ] of [LOC Liechtenstein  ] , [PER Christian Wenaweser  ] , who spent several weeks away from the [ORG UN  ] to preside in The [ORG Hague  ] over the [ORG ICC Assembly of States Parties.  ] <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The budget committee’s end game is still being played out . 
From the start of the intertwined debates over scales of contribution and various budget processes , the [ORG EU  ] provided critical support ( particularly since [LOC Japan  ] was less stalwart on budget stringency than in previous years ) . 
Early on , the [ORG EU  ] agreed to respect the inviolability of the cap on [LOC U.S.  ] contributions . 
In the scales of contribution debate , they agreed from the first to seek greater contributions from the governments of the large emerging economies , in line with our approach . 
On December 15 Ambassador [PER Rice  ] urged [ORG EU  ] PRs to accelerate their endgame on scales to reach consensus with the [MISC G-77  ] for both the peacekeeping and regular budgets . 
Our concern was that a continued EU/G-77 stand-off might jeopardize our ceiling on contributions . 
[ORG EU  ] PRs acknowledged that there is little chance of agreement with the [MISC G-77  ] , but urged continued [LOC U.S.  ] support for their efforts . 
Switzerland’s [ORG PR Peter Maurer  ] served ably and honestly as chair of the budget committee . 
LOOKING AHEAD TO [LOC UNGA65  ] <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) According to the [ORG UNGA  ] tradition of rotating its Presidency among the regional groupings , [MISC WEOG  ] ( whose numbers are weighted heavily towards the [MISC EU-27  ] ) chose its [LOC UNGA65  ] candidate . 
This selection will be ratified by the entire [LOC GA  ] membership in a June 2010 vote . 
The decision was taken quietly on December 14 in a [MISC WEOG  ] secret straw poll . 
[PER Joseph Deiss  ] , former President of the [LOC Swiss Confederation  ] outpolled the [MISC Belgian  ] candidate , [PER Louis Michel  ] , former [ORG FM  ] and [ORG EU  ] Commissioner , who ran as current chair of the [MISC European  ] Parliament’s inter-parliamentary association with parliamentarians from the [ORG ACP  ] ( developing world ) . 
[PER Deiss  ] is a consensus-builder and should preside efficiently , discreetly , and impartially . 
His performance as President of [LOC UNGA65  ] will be an indicator of how [MISC WEOG  ] can reach out to the [MISC G-77.  ] <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) Also looking ahead to [LOC UNGA65  ] , the [ORG EU  ] ( under its new , broader [MISC Lisbon Treaty  ] mandate ) will seek to become an enhanced observer . 
Subject to passage of an implementing resolution , the [ORG EU  ] delegation ( not the rotating [ORG EU  ] Presidency nation ) would speak early and authoritatively on all matters before any [ORG UNGA  ] meeting , from committees to plenary . 
The [ORG EU  ] member state permanent representatives are negotiating among themselves the language of such a resolution . 
Although they do not expect action on enhanced USUN NEW Y 00001141 004 OF 004 observership until the second half of 2010 , they are already previewing their request to the [ORG UN  ] membership . 
They have reached out to key groups and nations , from [LOC China  ] and [LOC India  ] to the [ORG Rio Group  ] . 
Such enhanced observer status for the [ORG EU  ] regional grouping may generate counterproposals from others such as the [ORG AU  ] or Caricom . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] will need to monitor the dynamic of such negotiations and outcomes for their effect on [LOC U.S.  ] equities and interests in future General [ORG Assemblies.  ] <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( U ) Another election is scheduled at [LOC UNGA65  ] , for the two [MISC WEOG  ] rotating seats on the 2011-2012 [ORG UNSC  ] . 
Three candidates are contending for the two seats: [LOC Canada  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , and [LOC Portugal.  ] <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment: Despite  ] initial concerns that [MISC European  ] delegations would soon come to view new [LOC U.S.  ] flexibility ( which generally reinforces their own positions ) as a natural state of affairs , they did not during the first months of UNGA64 “pocket” our flexibility and seek more . 
This dynamic is not yet played out , though , and so we should be prepared to counter any [ORG EU  ] presumption that [LOC U.S.  ] positions are necessarily crafted to align with [ORG EU  ] preferences . 
When we do so align , we should seek [ORG EU  ] reciprocity , either in terms of shifting an [ORG EU  ] negotiating position or in terms of [ORG EU  ] support in persuading [MISC G-77  ] members to back our common transatlantic positions. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Recommendation: Since the [ORG EU  ] concerts its [LOC UNGA65  ] positions by summer 2010 , it is in our interest to begin early , energetic , and detailed consultations . 
One influential interface would be with key [ORG EU  ] Permanent Representatives . 
This should allow us to work together to meet almost certain [MISC G-77  ] opposition to key elements of our policy , and to show transatlantic leadership at the [ORG UN  ] . 
Such pre-consultations should allow us to influence [ORG EU  ] consensus-building , before their positions crystallize . 
The bottom line is that the [ORG EU  ] generally provides our core support , so we should engage the [ORG EU  ] proactively and in detail .
