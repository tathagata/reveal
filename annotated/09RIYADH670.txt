KEY POINTS: -- ( C ) Ambassador [PER Richard Holbrooke  ] met in [LOC Riyadh  ] May 16 with HRH Prince Mohammed bin [PER Nayef  ] ( [ORG MbN  ] ) , [MISC Saudi  ] Assistant Minister of the [ORG Interior.  ] -- ( C ) [PER Holbrooke  ] emphasized that [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] should be treated as a closely inter-related problem . 
He stressed [LOC U.S.  ] desire for stronger cooperation and a common [MISC U.S./Saudi  ] approach to [LOC Pakistan  ] based on economic assistance , encouraging cooperation between [MISC Pakistani  ] political factions , and transforming the [MISC Pakistani  ] army to fight a counterinsurgency war. -- ( C ) [ORG MbN  ] noted the [MISC Saudis  ] viewed the [LOC Pakistan  ] army as the strongest element for stability in the country . 
In reply [PER Holbrooke  ] emphasized [LOC U.S.  ] support for [LOC Pakistan  ] 's democracy and said the [LOC U.S.  ] opposed a military coup . 
[ORG MbN  ] said he agreed. -- ( C ) [ORG MbN  ] described [LOC Yemen  ] as a dangerous failed state and a growing threat to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] because it attracts [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] ( [ORG AQ  ] ) , said [MISC Yemeni  ] President [PER Saleh  ] is losing control , and outlined a [MISC Saudi  ] strategy of co-opting [MISC Yemeni  ] tribes with assistance projects. -- ( C ) [ORG MbN  ] strongly supported President [PER Obama  ] 's decision to oppose release of photographs of [LOC U.S.  ] detainee interrogations , saying release would provide a boon to [ORG AQ  ] , and would be " the favor of their life . 
" [LOC PAKISTAN  ] MUST NOT FAIL <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Holbrooke  ] thanked the Prince for [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] 's $700 million pledge at the April 17 [LOC Pakistan  ] donors' conference in [LOC Japan  ] . 
He said he had not come to make demands or requests but simply to begin a consultative process . 
The fact that three [LOC U.S.  ] special envoys ( [PER Senator Mitchell  ] , [PER Dennis Ross  ] , and now [PER Holbrooke  ] ) have visited [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] demonstrates the importance President [PER Obama  ] places on [MISC U.S./Saudi  ] relations and the [MISC Saudi  ] role in the region . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] were a major problem the new [LOC U.S.  ] administration had inherited. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Success in [LOC Afghanistan  ] was essential for [LOC U.S.  ] security as well as security in [LOC Europe  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] , [PER Holbrooke  ] continued . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] might be able to live with some degree of instability in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but not with an unstable [LOC Pakistan  ] , because of [LOC Pakistan  ] 's nuclear arms , fragile politics , and relationship with [LOC India  ] . 
He asked if [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] shared this conclusion . 
[ORG MbN  ] said " Absolutely , " a comment echoed precisely in [PER Holbrooke  ] 's subsequent meetings with King [PER Abdullah  ] and Foreign Minister Prince [PER Saud al-Faisal  ] ( septels ) . 
It 's clear that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] has a " unique " relationship with [LOC Pakistan  ] , [PER Holbrooke  ] said . 
He noted that over 800,000 [MISC Pakistanis  ] live and work in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] was especially important to [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] , the most popular politician in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
These were reasons why what happened in [LOC Pakistan  ] was of direct concern to both the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Holbrooke  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] shared a common purpose on [LOC Pakistan  ] but not yet a " common collaboration . 
" The purpose of his visit was thus to begin a dialogue on [LOC Pakistan  ] and seek a common policy . 
Neither the [LOC U.S.  ] nor [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] could afford to let [LOC Pakistan  ] fall apart . 
There were three important issues to address: -- [LOC Pakistan  ] desperately needs economic assistance ; -- Even though the [MISC Saudis  ] preferred [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] , [PER Sharif  ] and [PER Zardari  ] need to be persuaded to work together ; -- The [LOC Pakistan  ] army needs to restructure itself to fight today 's war against the [ORG Taliban  ] rather than yesterday 's war against [LOC India  ] . 
If [LOC Pakistan  ] fell apart , [PER Holbrooke  ] said , the consequences for [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] would be " unimaginable , " especially if [LOC Pakistan  ] 's nuclear weapons fell into unfriendly hands . 
( " [PER God  ] forbid ! 
" interjected the Prince . 
) " Under your leadership , " [PER Holbrooke  ] told the Prince " [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] has defeated terror , but if [LOC Pakistan  ] falls apart , the result would be catastrophe . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Holbrooke  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] wanted to expand the [MISC U.S./Saudi  ] relationship concerning [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] could do a lot for [LOC Pakistan  ] , he added , noting that economic and social conditions in [LOC Pakistan  ] created fertile ground for extremism . 
[PER Zardari  ] had many faults but he was democratically elected , so the [LOC U.S.  ] tries to get him and [PER Sharif  ] to work together . 
Meanwhile , [PER Holbrooke  ] said , money for the [ORG Taliban  ] flows in from the region. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER MbN  ] said a vacuum in [LOC Islamabad  ] would be dangerous . 
He described [LOC Pakistan  ] army Chief of Staff General [PER Kayani  ] as a " decent man " who wanted to restore dignity to the army , and sought consensus support of all the civilian factions . 
The army was the [MISC Saudis'  ] " winning horse , " [PER MbN  ] said , but it needed to prepare to fight the current war against terror . 
[MISC Pakistani  ] soldiers needed to be proud of their service , and not hide their identity as soldiers when they were off duty , [PER MbN  ] said . 
He had told [PER Kayani  ] that [MISC Pakistani  ] troops needed to feel they were fighting for [LOC Pakistan  ] and not the [LOC U.S.  ] The [MISC Pakistani  ] army had a " golden opportunity " because now [LOC Pakistan  ] faced an external enemy . 
[PER MbN  ] emphasized that the army was [LOC Pakistan  ] 's " best bet " for stability . 
There were 800,000 [MISC Pakistanis  ] and over one million [MISC Indians  ] living in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [PER MbN  ] said , and millions more visited the Kingdom to make the [ORG Hajj  ] pilgrimage , so anything that happened in [LOC Pakistan  ] , or between [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC India  ] , was a threat to stability in [LOC Saudi Arabia.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Holbrooke  ] said he knew [PER Kayani  ] , with the Director of [LOC Pakistan  ] 's intelligence service ( ISI ) , and General [PER Pasha  ] , and also [PER Musharraf  ] . 
He recalled the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] had decided to support [PER Musharraf  ] in the aftermath of 9/11 . 
This had been the right decision at the time but [PER Musharraf  ] had been a disappointment . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] supported democracy in [LOC Pakistan  ] , not any individual leader . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] repeated that the [LOC U.S.  ] supported [PER Zardari  ] because he was elected , and emphasized that the [LOC U.S.  ] was " 100 percent opposed " to a military coup in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[PER MbN  ] assured that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] would not support a coup either. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) He noted the [LOC U.S.  ] agreed that corruption in [LOC Pakistan  ] was an issue , but the [LOC U.S.  ] had decided it was more important to help [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Attaching onerous conditions to assistance was a mistake , [PER Holbrooke  ] said . 
Since the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] agreed on [LOC Pakistan  ] 's importance , the question was how to start working together . 
[PER MbN  ] answered that [MISC U.S./Saudi  ] security cooperation should stay as it is , since it had " never been better " despite past tensions . 
Each side knew its own business best , and the focus should be on obtaining results . 
[PER MbN  ] characterized [MISC Saudi  ] cooperation with [LOC U.S.  ] law enforcement and intelligence agencies as " one team . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Holbrooke  ] reiterated that terrorists in [LOC Pakistan  ] were not under enough pressure and pressed the point that [MISC U.S./Saudi  ] cooperation on [LOC Pakistan  ] needed to rise to a higher level . 
[PER MbN  ] replied that he had asked King [PER Abdullah  ] for permission to maintain a " security channel " with the [LOC U.S.  ] to remain open at all times to facilitate information exchange regardless of other issues in bilateral relations . 
The Prince added that the King despised the corruption he saw in [LOC Pakistan  ] and this colored his views toward that country . 
" WE HAVE A PROBLEM CALLED [LOC YEMEN  ] " <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Moving to a new subject , the Prince said " We have a problem called [LOC Yemen  ] . 
" [ORG AQ  ] has found fertile ground there , he said . 
The geography was similar to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and many [MISC Yemenis  ] were more sympathetic to [ORG AQ  ] 's goals than were the [MISC Afghans  ] . 
[LOC Yemen  ] is also closer to [ORG AQ  ] targets and recruiting grounds in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
The [MISC Saudis  ] had detected a pattern of individuals coming to the Kingdom for [ORG Hajj  ] or [ORG Umrah  ] and then traveling south to [LOC Yemen  ] ( " it 's only 400 miles , " he noted ) for training before returning to their home countries . 
[MISC Saudi  ] forces have arrested [MISC Egyptians  ] and [MISC Algerians  ] , among others , who were attempting to do this. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER MbN  ] described [LOC Yemen  ] as a failed state that is " very , very , extremely dangerous , " and required focus . 
The [MISC Huthi  ] tribes were [MISC Takfiri  ] and [MISC Shi'a  ] " like [LOC Hizballah South  ] , " he said . 
This was a threat forming around [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] that required action now . 
The [MISC Saudis  ] would like [PER Saleh  ] to be a strong leader , [PER MbN  ] said , but " his vision of [LOC Yemen  ] has shrunk to [LOC Sana'a  ] , " and he was losing control over the rest of the country . 
[PER Saleh  ] 's old advisors were gone and now he relied on his son and other younger men who did not have good connections with the [MISC Yemeni  ] tribes . 
In contrast , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] had good connections with the tribes , [PER MbN  ] said. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER MbN  ] said the [MISC Saudis  ] had established a bilateral council with [LOC Yemen  ] that met twice a year to consider assistance projects . 
The [MISC Saudi  ] representatives were the [MISC Crown  ] prince and the oil minister ( Note: [MISC Crown  ] Prince [PER Sultan  ] has been incapacitated by illness for at least he past year ; it is not clear whether the bilateral council has continued to meet in his absence . 
) [MISC Saudi  ] assistance to [LOC Yemen  ] was not in the form of cash payments , [PER MbN  ] said , since cash tended to end up in [MISC Swiss  ] banks . 
Instead the [MISC Saudis  ] backed projects in the tribal areas of [LOC Yemen  ] where [ORG AQ  ] was hiding . 
The idea was that when [MISC Yemenis  ] saw the concrete benefits of these projects they would push their leaders to eject the extremists . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] was counting on this strategy , [PER MbN  ] said , to persuade [MISC Yemenis  ] to see extremists as criminals rather than heroes . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] replied that the [LOC U.S.  ] understood [MISC Saudi  ] concerns about [LOC Yemen  ] , and would work with the [MISC Saudis  ] to address the problem there . 
TERRORISTS STOLE OUR FAITH <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Turning to another issue , [PER MbN  ] recalled that the day following President [PER Obama  ] 's inauguration , [LOC White House  ] counterterrorism advisor [PER Brennan  ] had telephoned to assure him the new president was committed to continuing the war on terror . 
" Terrorists stole the most valuable things we have , " said the Prince . 
" They took our faith and our children and used them to attack us . 
" It had not been easy to see [MISC Saudi  ] involvement in 9/11 and other terrorist incidents , he said . 
[ORG AQ  ] was smart in wanting to hit both the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
[ORG AQ  ] 's strategic goal was to hurt the [LOC U.S.  ] and to take control of the [ORG Holy Cities of Mecca  ] and [ORG Medina.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER MbN  ] claimed that in 2003 radicals were present in " 90 percent " of [MISC Saudi  ] mosques . 
The current [MISC Saudi  ] leadership had decided it needed to be on the front lines of the struggle against terrorism , that the task could not be left to the next generation , since [ORG AQ  ] gained momentum every time it succeeded . 
The [MISC Saudis  ] realized they could not fight back without public support , he said , and developed a strategy of working with families of suicide bombers and other extremists who had been killed . 
This approach involved providing support to the families and telling them their sons had been " victims " and not " criminals . 
" This gave the families " a way out " and provided a public relations advantage to the government . 
" If you stop five but create fifty " new radicals , " that 's dumb . 
" [PER MbN  ] said . 
The [MISC Saudis  ] measure their success against extremism by looking at levels of terrorist recruitment the number of successful operations , and they see a growing rejection of extremist violence . 
The Prince related an anecdote about an anti-terrorist operation in which the officer commanding [ORG Interior Ministry  ] forces had discovered his cousin was the leader of the terrorists inside a surrounded building . 
[PER MbN  ] said he had offered to relieve the officer , but the latter had refused , and had insisted on leading the attack . 
The officer succeeded in defeating the terrorists while capturing his cousin alive. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] was not yet free of terrorism , [PER MbN  ] said . 
Thus it remained important to defeat the terrorists on the ground , in the media , and ideologically . 
The [MISC Saudis  ] wanted to do this in cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] , the Prince said . 
Time was the key , and it was " not in our favor , " he added , so " we need to work fast . 
" <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) On terrorist financing , [PER MbN  ] said " We are trying to do our best . 
" [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] has millions of visitors , especially during [ORG Hajj  ] . 
The [MISC Saudis  ] are making arrests , but are not making this public . 
Instead , the [MISC Saudi  ] goal is to make the public aware that donations could go to the wrong places . 
[PER MbN  ] said that " if money wants to go " to terrorist causes , " it will go , " and that terrorist attacks were inexpensive , " but let 's make it harder . 
" [PER Holbrooke  ] asked what the [MISC Saudis  ] would do with [MISC Pakistanis  ] in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] who financed terrorism . 
The Prince replied the suspects would be tried in [LOC Shari'a  ] courts with [MISC Wahhabi  ] judges so that the results of the judicial process could be used to condemn extremist ideology . 
A BIG FAVOR TO [ORG AL-QAEDA  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [PER Holbrooke  ] explained that President [PER Obama  ] had decided to oppose release of 2000 photographs of [LOC U.S.  ] interrogations of terrorist suspects on grounds of national security , and asked what the [MISC Saudi  ] public reaction would be to publication of these photos . 
[PER MbN  ] responded " You bet ! 
" it would be bad for security , and noted that following publication of the first [LOC Abu Ghraib  ] photos , [MISC Saudi  ] authorities had arrested 250 individuals trying to leave [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] to join extremist groups in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Release of more pictures would give [ORG AQ  ] " the favor of their life , " said the Prince . 
[LOC Saudi Arabia  ] had fought very hard to defeat [ORG AQ  ] on the [MISC Internet  ] , but he couldn , t see how to fight 2000 new photos. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 .
