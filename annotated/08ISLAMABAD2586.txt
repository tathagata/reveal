( C ) [LOC Islamabad  ] attorney [PER Javed Iqbal Jaffery  ] ( who also represents [MISC Pakistani  ] nuclear scientist [PER AQ Khan  ] ) filed a habeas corpus petition with the [ORG Islamabad High Court  ] ( [ORG IHC  ] ) July 29 on behalf of [PER Aafia Siddiqui  ] a [MISC Pakistani  ] national . 
There have been a spate of press reports about [PER Siddiqui  ] following a July 6 press conference in which [LOC UK  ] journalist [PER Yvonne Ridley  ] accused the [LOC U.S.  ] of holding and perhaps torturing an unnamed woman in solitary confinement since 2004 at the [ORG Bagram Theater Internment Facility  ] . 
The [ORG IHC  ] ordered [ORG Interior Ministry  ] Secretary [PER Kamal Shah  ] to report on Siddique’s status , but for now the court exempted the other respondents , who include the [ORG Embassy’s Legal Attach  ] , President [PER Musharraf  ] , and former President [PER Farooq Ahmad Leghari  ] . 
The [ORG IHC  ] adjourned the case until September 9. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) According to press reports , [PER Jaffrey  ] claims in the petition that [LOC U.S.  ] operatives kidnapped Dr. [PER Aafia Siddiqui  ] , with her three children , in 2004 as part of an al [PER Qaeda  ] hunt . 
It also charged that the [LOC U.S.  ] moved her to the [ORG Bagram Theater Internment Facility  ] with the help of [MISC Pakistani  ] authorities . 
[PER Jaffrey  ] also petitioned the [ORG IHC  ] to ask the respondents whether [PER Siddiqui  ] had been killed in detention . 
If she is alive , [PER Jaffrey  ] wants her presented before the Court and given compensation for the illegal detention. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) On July 19 the [ORG Senate Functional Committee  ] on [ORG Human Rights  ] called on the [ORG Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] to address the issue of any detained [MISC Pakistani  ] women in [LOC Bagram  ] or [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] . 
Previously the MFA had denied knowledge of the alleged detention of any [MISC Pakistani  ] woman. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment: It is unclear who is paying [PER Jaffrey  ] and/or orchestrating this campaign on Siddiqui’s behalf . 
[PER Siddiqui  ] has family living in [LOC Karachi  ] and noted politicians , including [PER Imran Khan  ] , continue their vocal support for her cause . 
[LOC Bagram  ] officials have assured us that they have not been holding [PER Siddiqui  ] for the last four years , as has been alleged . 
End comment .
