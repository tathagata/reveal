( [ORG S  ] ) Summary . 
[MISC Mexican  ] Navy forces acting on [LOC U.S.  ] information killed [PER Arturo Beltran Leyva  ] in an operation on December 16 , the highest-level takedown of a cartel figure under the [PER Calderon  ] administration . 
The operation is a clear victory for the [MISC Mexican  ] Government and an example of excellent [MISC USG-GOM  ] cooperation . 
The unit that conducted the operation had recieved extensive [LOC U.S.  ] training . 
[PER Arturo Beltran Leyva  ] 's death will not solve [LOC Mexico  ] 's drug problem , but it will hopefully generate the momentum necessary to make sustained progress against other drug trafficking organizations . 
End Summary . 
The Operation ------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [MISC Mexican  ] Navy ( [ORG SEMAR  ] ) sources revealed on the night of December 17 that [ORG SEMAR  ] forces killed [PER Arturo Beltran Leyva  ] ( [ORG ABL  ] ) , head of the [ORG Beltran Leyva Organization  ] , during a shoot-out in [LOC Cuernavaca  ] ( approximately 50 miles south of [LOC Mexico City  ] ) that afternoon . 
At least three other cartel operatives were killed during the raid , with a fourth committing suicide . 
While it still has not been confirmed , Embassy officials believe the latter to be [ORG ABL  ] 's brother , [PER Hector  ] , which would mean that all [PER Beltran Leyva  ] brothers are either dead or in prison . 
[PER Arturo Beltran Leyva  ] has a long history of involvement in the [MISC Mexican  ] drug trade , and worked with [LOC Joaquin  ] " [LOC El Chapo  ] " Guzman and his [ORG Sinaloa Cartel  ] before splitting in 2008 . 
The rivalry between the [ORG Sinaloa  ] and [PER Beltran Leyva  ] organizations has been a key factor driving the escalating levels of narcotics-related violence in recent years . 
Born in [ORG Sinaloa  ] , [ORG ABL  ] has been key to the importation and distribution of cocaine and heroin in the [LOC United States  ] , and also has extensive money laundering capabilities , corruption networks , and international contacts in [LOC Colombia  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Embassy law enforcement officials say that the arrest operation targeting [ORG ABL  ] began about a week prior to his death when the Embassy relayed detailed information on his location to [ORG SEMAR  ] . 
The [ORG SEMAR  ] unit has been trained extensively by [ORG NORTHCOM  ] over the past several years . 
[ORG SEMAR  ] raided an identified location , where they killed several [ORG ABL  ] bodyguards and arrested over 23 associates , while [ORG ABL  ] and [PER Hector  ] escaped . 
On Monday , the Embassy interagency linked [ORG ABL  ] to an apartment building located in [LOC Cuernavaca  ] ( about an hour south of [LOC Mexico City  ] ) , where [ORG ABL  ] was in hiding . 
[ORG SEMAR  ] initiated an arrest operation on Wednesday afternoon , surrounding the identified apartment complex , and establishing a security perimeter . 
[ORG ABL  ] 's forces fired on the [ORG SEMAR  ] operatives and engaged in a sustained firefight that wounded three [ORG SEMAR  ] marines and possibly killed one . 
[ORG SEMAR  ] forces evacuated residents of the apartment complex to the gym , according to press accounts , and no civilian casualties have so far been reported . 
The [MISC Mexican  ] Interagency ----------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The successful operation against [ORG ABL  ] comes on the heels of an aggressive [ORG SEMAR  ] effort in [LOC Monterrey  ] against [LOC Zeta  ] forces ( ref a ) and highlights its emerging role as a key player in the counternarcotics fight . 
[ORG SEMAR  ] is well-trained , well-equipped , and has shown itself capable of responding quickly to actionable intelligence . 
Its success puts the [ORG Army  ] ( [ORG SEDENA  ] ) in the difficult position of explaining why it has been reluctant to act on good intelligence and conduct operations against high-level targets . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] interagency originally provided the information to [ORG SEDENA  ] , whose refusal to move quickly reflected a risk aversion that cost the institution a major counternarcotics victory . 
[ORG SEDENA  ] did provide backup to [ORG SEMAR  ] during the firefight with [ORG ABL  ] forces , but can take little credit for the operation . 
Public Security Secretary ( [ORG SSP  ] ) [PER Genaro Garcia Luna  ] can also be counted as a net loser in the [MISC Mexican  ] interagency following the [ORG ABL  ] operation . 
[ORG SSP  ] considers high-level [PER Beltran Leyva  ] targets to be its responsibility , and [PER Garcia Luna  ] has already [LOC MEXICO  ] 00003573 002 OF 003 said privately that the operation should have been his . 
The Impact on Violence ---------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) It is early to say with a great degree of confidence what kind of effect [ORG ABL  ] 's death will have on levels of narco-related violence in [LOC Mexico  ] . 
A spike is probably likely in the short term as inter- and intra-cartel battles are intensified by the sudden leadership gap in one of the country 's most important cartels . 
With all the [PER Beltran Leyva  ] brothers likely dead or in prison , there are a number of other cartel functionaries likely to vie for the leadership slot . 
Moreover , rival organizations may intensify efforts to expand their influence in the disarray likely to follow [ORG ABL  ] 's death . 
At the very least , efforts to clean the [PER Beltran Leyva  ] house and rout out suspected informers will be bloody , and retaliation by the organization against [MISC Mexican  ] law enforcement or military officials is not out of the cards. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In the medium to longer term , [ORG ABL  ] 's death could have the potential to lower the level of narco-violence rates . 
[ORG ABL  ] himself was a particularly violent leader with numerous effective assassin teams . 
Moreover , the [PER Sinaloa-Beltran Leyva  ] rivalry has been responsible for a large number of narcotics-related homicides in [LOC Mexico  ] , and also largely personally driven by the [PER Beltran Leyva  ] brothers themselves . 
Emboffs speculate that [PER Beltran Leyva  ] associates , under pressure and perhaps more vulnerable due to leadership deficiencies , could move to align more closely again with [ORG Sinaloa  ] , which they might think offers a more natural protection than the [ORG Zetas  ] . 
The Boost for [PER Calderon  ] ---------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG SEMAR  ] 's successful operation against [ORG ABL  ] is a major victory for President [PER Calderon  ] and his war against organized crime . 
[ORG ABL  ] is the highest ranking target taken down by the [PER Calderon  ] government , and his status as one of the most important and long-standing of [MISC Mexican  ] drug traffickers makes his takedown even more symbolically important . 
President [PER Calderon  ] has openly admitted to having a tough year -- his party lost big in the midterm elections , he is confronting an economic crisis , and nationwide homicide rates continue to climb -- and contacts have told [PER Poloff  ] that he has seemed " down " in meetings . 
The [ORG SEMAR  ] operation is undoubtedly a huge boost for him , both in terms of bolstering public support for his security efforts and in reassuring himself that important security accomplishments in this area are possible . 
[PER Calderon  ] 's political opponents will also find it far less useful to accuse the President of hanging on to an ineffective anti-crime strategy that nets numerous mid- to low-level cartel figures but fails to rein in the major kingpins . 
The major [LOC Mexico City  ] dailies have run front page [PER Beltran Leyva  ] stories , and President [PER Calderon  ] 's remarks in a press conference from [LOC Copenhagen  ] highlighting that the operation represents an " important achievement for the [MISC Mexican  ] people and government " were widely covered . 
Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The operation against [PER Arturo Beltran Leyva  ] is a clear victory for the [MISC Mexican  ] Government and an example of excellent [MISC USG-GOM  ] cooperation . 
Seamless Embassy interagency collaboration combined with a willing , capable , and ready [ORG SEMAR  ] produced one of the greatest successes to date in the counternarcotics fight . 
[ORG ABL  ] 's death will provide an important boost to [PER Calderon  ] and hopefully will cultivate a greater sense of confidence within [MISC Mexican  ] security agencies that will encourage them to take greater advantage of similar opportunities . 
[ORG SEMAR  ] 's win in particular may encourage [ORG SEDENA  ] to be more proactive and less risk averse in future operations . 
[ORG ABL  ] 's death will certainly not resolve [LOC Mexico  ] 's drug problem , but it will likely generate the momentum necessary within the [MISC GOM  ] security apparatus to make sustained and real progress against the country 's drug trafficking organizations .
