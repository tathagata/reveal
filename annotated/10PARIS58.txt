[LOC PARIS  ] 1714 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Charles H. Rivkin  ] , Reasons 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C/NF ) SUMMARY: In keeping with [LOC France  ] 's unique history and circumstances , Embassy [LOC Paris  ] has created a Minority Engagement Strategy that encompasses , among other groups , the [MISC French  ] [ORG Muslim  ] population and responds to the goals outlined in reftel [PER A. Our  ] aim is to engage the [MISC French  ] population at all levels in order to amplify [LOC France  ] 's efforts to realize its own egalitarian ideals , thereby advancing [LOC U.S.  ] national interests . 
While [LOC France  ] is justifiably proud of its leading role in conceiving democratic ideals and championing human rights and the rule of law , [MISC French  ] institutions have not proven themselves flexible enough to adjust to an increasingly heterodox demography . 
We believe that if [LOC France  ] , over the long run , does not successfully increase opportunity and provide genuine political representation for its minority populations , [LOC France  ] could become a weaker , more divided country , perhaps more crisis-prone and inward-looking , and consequently a less capable ally . 
To support [MISC French  ] efforts to provide equal opportunity for minority populations , we will engage in positive discourse ; set a strong example ; implement an aggressive youth outreach strategy ; encourage moderate voices ; propagate best practices ; and deepen our understanding of the underlying causes of inequality in [LOC France  ] . 
We will also integrate the efforts of various Embassy sections , target influential leaders among our primary audiences , and evaluate both tangible and intangible indicators of the success of our strategy . 
END SUMMARY. --------------------------------------------- ----- BACKGROUND: THE CRISIS OF REPRESENTATION IN [LOC FRANCE  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) [LOC France  ] has long championed human rights and the rule of law , both at home and abroad , and justifiably perceives itself as a historic leader among democratic nations . 
This history and self-perception will serve us well as we implement the strategy outlined here , in which we press [LOC France  ] toward a fuller application of the democratic values it espouses . 
This strategy is necessary because [MISC French  ] institutions have not proven themselves flexible enough to adjust to the country 's increasingly heterodox demography . 
Very few minorities hold leadership positions in [LOC France  ] 's public institutions . 
As President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's own Diversity Czar [PER Yazid Sabeg  ] told Ambassador [PER Rivkin  ] in December , the [ORG National Assembly  ] " serves as a mirror of the crisis of representation in [LOC France  ] " ( reftel B ) . 
The [ORG National Assembly  ] , among its 577 deputies , has a single black member from metropolitan [LOC France  ] ( excluding its island territories ) , but does not have any elected representatives of [ORG Muslim  ] or [MISC Arab  ] extraction , though this minority group alone represents approximately 10 percent of the population . 
The [ORG Senate  ] has two [MISC Muslim Senators  ] ( out of 343 ) , but no black representatives and only a few [MISC Senators  ] hail from other ethnic or religious minorities . 
[PER Sabeg  ] also noted that none of [LOC France  ] 's approximately 180 Ambassadors is black , and only one is of [MISC North African  ] descent . 
Despite [PER Sarkozy  ] 's appointment of leaders such as [PER Rachida Dati  ] , [PER Fidela Amara  ] and [PER Rama Yade  ] , minorities continue to confront a very thick glass ceiling in [LOC France  ] 's public institutions . 
The [MISC French  ] media remains overwhelmingly white , with only modest increases in minority representation on camera for major news broadcasts . 
Among [MISC French  ] elite educational institutions , we are only aware that Sciences Po has taken serious steps to integrate . 
While slightly better represented in private organizations , minorities in [LOC France  ] lead very few corporations and foundations . 
Thus the reality of [MISC French  ] public life defies the nation 's egalitarian ideals . 
In-group , elitist politics still characterize [MISC French  ] public institutions , while extreme right , xenophobic policies hold appeal for a small ( but occasionally influential ) minority . 
Post will continue to explore other underlying causes of the social , political and economic barriers impeding the advancement of minorities in [LOC France  ] ( see [ORG Tactic  ] 6 , below ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) [LOC France  ] suffers consequences when its leading institutions fail to reflect the composition of its population . 
We believe [LOC France  ] has not benefited fully from the energy , drive , and ideas of its minorities . 
Despite some [MISC French  ] claims to serve as a model of assimilation and meritocracy , undeniable inequities tarnish [LOC France  ] 's global image and diminish its influence abroad . 
In our view , a sustained failure to increase opportunity and provide genuine political representation for its minority populations could render [LOC France  ] a weaker , more divided country . 
The geopolitical consequences of [LOC France  ] 's weakness and division will adversely affect [LOC U.S.  ] interests , as we need strong partners in the heart of [LOC Europe  ] to help us promote democratic [LOC PARIS  ] 00000058 002 OF 004 values . 
Moreover , social exclusion has domestic consequences for [LOC France  ] , including the alienation of some segments of the population , which can in turn adversely affect our own efforts to fight global networks of violent extremists . 
A thriving , inclusive [MISC French  ] polity will help advance our interests in expanding democracy and increasing stability worldwide. ------------------------------- A STRATEGY FOR FRANCE: OUR AIMS ------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) The overarching goal of our minority outreach strategy is to engage the [MISC French  ] population at all levels in order to help [LOC France  ] to realize its own egalitarian ideals . 
Our strategy has three broad target audiences in mind: ( 1 ) the majority , especially the elites ; ( 2 ) minorities , with a focus on their leaders ; ( 3 ) and the general population . 
Employing the seven tactics described below , we aim ( 1 ) to increase awareness among [LOC France  ] 's elites of the benefits of expanding opportunity and the costs of maintaining the status quo ; ( 2 ) to improve the skills and grow the confidence of minority leaders who seek to increase their influence ; ( 3 ) and to communicate to the general population in [LOC France  ] that we particularly admire the diversity and dynamism of its population , while emphasizing the advantages of profiting from those qualities by expanding opportunities for all. -------------------------------------- [ORG TACTIC  ] 1: ENGAGE IN POSITIVE DISCOURSE -------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) First , we will focus our discourse on the issue of equal opportunity . 
When we give public addresses about the community of democracies , we will emphasize , among the qualities of democracy , the right to be different , protection of minority rights , the value of equal opportunity , and the importance of genuine political representation . 
In private meetings , we will deliberately direct questions about equal opportunity in [LOC France  ] to high-level , non-minority [MISC French  ] leaders . 
Rather than retreating from discussions involving two sacred cows in [LOC France  ] -- the concepts of " secularism " and " communitarianism " -- we will engage [MISC French  ] leaders directly about the role that their terminology and intellectual frameworks could play in creating ( or diminishing ) equality of opportunity in [LOC France  ] . 
We will endeavor to convey the costs to [LOC France  ] of the under-representation of minorities , highlighting the benefits we have accumulated , over time , by working hard to chip away at the various impediments faced by [MISC American  ] minorities . 
We will , of course , continue to adopt a humble attitude regarding our own situation in the [LOC U.S.  ] , but nevertheless will stress the innumerable benefits accruing from a proactive approach to broad social inclusion , complementing our [MISC French  ] partners on any positive steps they take . 
In addition , we will continue and intensify our work with [MISC French  ] museums and educators to reform the history curriculum taught in [MISC French  ] schools , so that it takes into account the role and perspectives of minorities in [MISC French  ] history. ------------------------------ [ORG TACTIC  ] 2: SET A STRONG EXAMPLE ------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) Second , we will employ the tool of example . 
We will continue and expand our efforts to bring minority leaders from the [LOC U.S.  ] to [LOC France  ] , working with these [MISC American  ] leaders to convey an honest sense of their experience to [MISC French  ] minority and non-minority leaders alike . 
When we send [MISC French  ] leaders to [LOC America  ] , we will include , as often as possible , a component of their trip that focuses on equal opportunity . 
In the [MISC Embassy  ] , we will continue to invite a broad spectrum of [MISC French  ] society to our events , and avoid , as appropriate , hosting white-only events , or minority-only events . 
We will be inclusive , working in this way to break down barriers , facilitate communication , and expand networks . 
By bringing together groups who would not otherwise interact together , the [MISC Embassy  ] will continue to use its cachet to create networking opportunities that cut through traditional cultural and social barriers in [LOC France.  ] ------------------------------------------ [ORG TACTIC  ] 3: LAUNCH AGGRESSIVE YOUTH OUTREACH ------------------------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) Third , we will continue and expand our youth outreach efforts in order to communicate about our shared values with young [MISC French  ] audiences of all socio-cultural backgrounds . 
Leading the charge on this effort , the Ambassador 's inter-agency [ORG Youth Outreach Initiative  ] aims to engender a positive dynamic among [MISC French  ] youth that leads to greater support for [LOC U.S.  ] objectives and values . 
Some [LOC PARIS  ] 00000058 003 OF 004 elements of our [ORG Youth Outreach Initiative  ] have particular importance for minorities , including: -- Drawing heavily on new media , we aim first to build trust and gain understanding among [MISC French  ] youth from diverse backgrounds . 
-- While reinforcing mutual trust and understanding , we seek to help [LOC France  ] 's next generation improve their capacity to lead in their communities , while also conveying the importance of transcending the bounds of their own communities in order to make a broader , national impact . 
-- To achieve these aims , we will build on the expansive [MISC Public Diplomacy  ] programs already in place at post , and develop creative , additional means to influence the youth of [LOC France  ] , employing new media , corporate partnerships , nationwide competitions , targeted outreach events , especially invited [LOC U.S.  ] guests . 
-- We will also develop new tools to identify , learn from , and influence future [MISC French  ] leaders . 
-- As we expand training and exchange opportunities for the youth of [LOC France  ] , we will continue to make absolutely certain that the exchanges we support are inclusive . 
-- We will build on existing youth networks in [LOC France  ] , and create new ones in cyberspace , connecting [LOC France  ] 's future leaders to each other in a forum whose values we help to shape -- values of inclusion , mutual respect , and open dialogue. ---------------------------------- [ORG TACTC  ] 4: ENCOURAGE MODERATE VOICES ---------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) Fourth , we will encourage moderate voices of tolerance to express themselves with courage and conviction . 
Building on our work with two prominent websites geared toward young French-speaking Muslims -- oumma.fr and saphirnews.com -- we will support , train , and engage media and political activists who share our values . 
As we continue to meet with moderate leaders of minority groups , we will also expand our efforts to facilitate grass roots inter-faith exchanges . 
We will share in [LOC France  ] , with faith communities and with the [ORG Ministry of the Interior  ] , the most effective techniques for teaching tolerance currently employed in [MISC American  ] mosques , synagogues , churches , and other religious institutions . 
We will engage directly with the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] to compare [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC French  ] approaches to supporting minority leaders who seek moderation and mutual understanding , while also comparing our responses to those who seek to sow hatred and discord. --------------------------------- [ORG TACTC  ] 5: PROPAGATE BEST PRACTICES --------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) Fifth , we will continue our project of sharing best practices with young leaders in all fields , including young political leaders of all moderate parties so that they have the toolkits and mentoring to move ahead . 
We will create or support training and exchange programs that teach the enduring value of broad inclusion to schools , civil society groups , bloggers , political advisors , and local politicians . 
Through outreach programs , [MISC Embassy  ] officers from all sections will interact and communicate to these same groups our best practices in creating equal opportunities for all [MISC Americans  ] . 
We will also provide tools for teaching tolerance to the network of over 1,000 [MISC American  ] university students who teach [MISC English  ] in [MISC French  ] schools every year. --------------------------------------------- ---- [ORG TACTIC  ] 6: DEEPEN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEM --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C/NF ) Sixth , through focused contact work , reporting and analysis , we will deepen the USG understanding of the underlying causes of inequality and discrimination in [LOC France  ] . 
We will break new ground by examining how the very structure of some [MISC French  ] institutions may limit minority representation in elected office and the high ranks of the civil service . 
Examining significant developments in depth , such as the debate on national identity ( reftel B ) , we plan to track trends and , ideally , predict change in the status of minorities in [LOC France  ] , estimating how this change will impact [LOC U.S.  ] interests . 
As our awareness expands and deepens , we will adjust , accordingly , the minority outreach strategy described here. --------------------------------------------- -------- [LOC PARIS  ] 00000058 004 OF 004 [ORG TACTIC  ] 7: INTEGRATE , TARGET , AND EVALUATE OUR EFFORTS --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C/NF ) Finally , a [ORG Minority Working Group  ] will integrate the discourse , actions , and analysis of relevant sections and agencies in the [MISC Embassy  ] . 
This group , working in tandem with the [ORG Youth Outreach Initiative  ] , will identify and target influential leaders and groups among our primary audiences . 
It will also evaluate our impact over the course of the year , by examining both tangible and intangible indicators of success . 
Tangible changes include a measurable increase in the number of minorities leading and participating in public and private organizations , including elite educational institutions ; growth in the number of constructive efforts by minority leaders to organize political support both within and beyond their own minority communities ; new , proactive policies to enhance social inclusion adopted by non-minority political leaders ; expansion of inter-communal and inter-faith exchanges at the local level ; decrease in popular support for xenophobic political parties and platforms . 
While we could never claim credit for these positive developments , we will focus our efforts in carrying out activities , described above , that prod , urge and stimulate movement in the right direction . 
In addition , we will track intangible measures of success -- a growing sense of belonging , for example , among young [MISC French  ] minorities , and a burgeoning hope that they , too , can represent their country at home , and abroad , even one day at the pinnacle of [MISC French  ] public life , as president of the [LOC Republic  ] .
