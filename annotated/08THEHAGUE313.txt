End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Per reftels , [PER Noland  ] compared notes on the halted shipment of tritium gas at [LOC Schiphol International Airport  ] in December 2007 . 
She said a [MISC Dutch  ] firm had attempted to make the shipment on behalf of its [MISC German  ] parent company [ORG Campro Scientific  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] firm claimed the tritium gas was intended -- in conjunction with leucine proteins -- to treat blood disease at an [MISC Iranian  ] children 's hospital . 
[PER Noland  ] said that such radioactive treatment is extremely experimental in [LOC Europe  ] , and [MISC Dutch  ] authorities greatly doubted that [MISC Iranian  ] medical science had advanced to the point where such treatment could be used on children . 
Given the radioactive nature of the gas and end destination in [LOC Iran  ] , the [ORG GONL  ] insisted the firm apply for an export license , which the firm has yet to do. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Noland  ] said that while the shipment was halted , [MISC Dutch  ] authorities did not seize the tritium gas . 
She said the [MISC Dutch  ] suspect the tritium gas is still in the [LOC Netherlands  ] , as returning it to [LOC Germany  ] would require a special license to transport such a controlled item . 
[PER Noland  ] said the [MISC Dutch  ] continue to investigate the incident , including the possibility of filing criminal charges against the [MISC Dutch  ] firm. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Noland  ] noted that cooperation with [MISC German  ] authorities has been excellent , and said that [ORG Campro Scientific  ] had attempted to make a similar shipment a year earlier from [LOC Germany  ] . 
She noted that both the [MISC German  ] parent firm and [MISC Dutch  ] subsidiary have [MISC Iranian  ] leadership , and said that according to [MISC German  ] authorities , the [MISC German  ] director had been arrested , while an [MISC Iranian  ] diplomat associated with the firm 's activities had been expelled from [LOC Germany.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Noland  ] said the [MISC Dutch  ] have reported the incident to the [ORG IAEA  ] so that it will be included in the illicit trafficking database . 
She said the [MISC Dutch  ] were interested in making a [ORG NSG  ] presentation on the incident , but have been asked by [LOC Germany  ] to postpone such a presentation due to the on-going investigations in both [LOC Germany  ] and the [LOC Netherlands  ] .
