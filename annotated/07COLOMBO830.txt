Blake  ] , Jr. , for reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) SUMMARY: In late May PolOff met the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] described the [MISC LTTE’s  ] complete control of all activities that take place in [MISC Tiger-controlled  ] territory , including forced conscription and the use of the [ORG Tamil Rehabilitation Organization  ] ( [ORG TRO  ] ) to extract money from [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also criticized the [LOC Sri Lanka  ] Monitoring Mission’s ( [ORG SLMM  ] ) complacency in the face of coercive techniques the [ORG LTTE  ] employs to maintain control of its northern stronghold . 
On June 8 , after meetings with representatives from [ORG UNICEF  ] , [ORG UNHCR  ] and the [ORG World Food Program  ] to discuss how these organizations fund projects operating in the [PER Vanni  ] , [PER Emboffs  ] confirmed that in some circumstances INGOs are required to work with [ORG TRO  ] to accomplish their project goals . 
END SUMMARY . 
FORCED CONSCRIPTION ------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On May 21 , PolOff met [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] private organization that provides assistance to refugees . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] described the [MISC LTTE’s  ] “one person per family” forced conscription program . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that the [ORG Tigers  ] require at least one person between the ages of 18 and 35 per family to fight for the [ORG LTTE  ] , apparently believing that if the “draftees” are at least 18 years old , the international community cannot criticize the [ORG Tigers  ] for requiring military service . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that the [ORG LTTE  ] provides written notice to draftees with orders to report to a particular military office for service . 
If they fail to report , they are taken forcibly , often at night. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that the average age of [ORG LTTE  ] “recruits” is now 17 years old . 
He confirmed , however , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] allegation of forced conscription of those 17 years old and older , stating that if a person failed to leave the [PER Vanni  ] before he or she turned 17 , there was an extremely high likelihood of being drafted by the [ORG Tigers.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] accused the [ORG SLMM  ] of turning a blind eye to [ORG LTTE  ] forced conscription of [MISC Tamil  ] citizens living in the [PER Vanni  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that “all countries are entitled to institute the draft to protect their borders.” <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) We have received other credible reports of even more draconian conscription methods used by the [ORG Tigers  ] . 
Some families are reportedly being told to provide two recruits as the [ORG LTTE  ] prepares for war . 
The [ORG Tigers  ] may threaten families living in the [PER Vanni  ] or elsewhere in [LOC Sri Lanka  ] if their children do not return from jobs abroad , such as in the [LOC Persian Gulf  ] , to take up arms . 
[ORG TRO  ] FUNDING [ORG LTTE  ] OPERATIONS --------------------------- [ORG COLOMBO  ] 00000830 002 OF 003 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us the [ORG LTTE  ] had ordered INGOs to provide all project funding through local [ORG NGOs  ] , which are managed collectively by the [ORG Tamil Rehabilitation Organization  ] ( [ORG TRO  ] ) . 
For example , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] receives money in its bank account from its headquarters or from international donors , then deposits the money into a separate bank account operated by a local [ORG NGO  ] . 
The local [MISC NGO’s  ] director is always a member of [ORG TRO  ] , as are many other members of the local [ORG NGO  ] staff . 
The [ORG TRO  ] representative withdraws the money from the local [MISC NGO’s  ] account , provides a cut to the [ORG LTTE  ] , and distributes the rest to accomplish the particular project [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is funding with that donation . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] then oversees the implementation of the program , but does not control any distribution of funds after they are transferred into the local [MISC NGO’s  ] account. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] alleges that it does not comply with the [MISC LTTE’s  ] funding demands , but in reality , it does comply by removing its funding one additional step . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the [ORG UN  ] provides funding to international voluntary organizations , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] who then comply with the [MISC LTTE’s  ] funding demands , thus providing [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] with a measure of distance and “plausible deniability.” [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that in addition to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] of the [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] organizations [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] operating in the [PER Vanni  ] are complying with the [ORG LTTE  ] procedures . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) One June 8 , [PER Emboffs  ] met with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that [ORG UNCHR  ] did not work through [ORG TRO  ] representatives in the [PER Vanni  ] , but could not say whether INGOs did so . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] confirmed that although the [ORG UN  ] does not work through the [ORG TRO  ] , it does provide some funding to Is and local [ORG NGOs  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that he was aware of times when [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] were asked to work with local program managers who are likely representatives of the [ORG LTTE  ] , but he was unsure whether this requirement extended to funding arrangements . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that the [ORG LTTE  ] needs food supplies so badly that the [ORG WFP  ] has successfully rebuffed [ORG LTTE  ] attempts to levy taxes on items brought into the [PER Vanni  ] . 
He added that although the [ORG WFP  ] does not provide financial assistance to the [ORG Tigers  ] , he knows that several [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] are required to provide financial resources to the [ORG LTTE  ] through the [ORG TRO  ] in order to accomplish their objectives in the [LOC Vanni.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) COMMENT: According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , other organizations have not complained about [ORG LTTE  ] interference in their operations because they suffer from “a blinding case of clientitis.” However , one could also argue that amounts to a simple acceptance of the realities of working in [MISC LTTE-controlled  ] territory . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] anecdotal evidence of [ORG TRO  ] serving as a conduit to channel funds to the [ORG LTTE  ] strikes us as authentic . 
Although Post was unable to confirm [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] allegations with the same level of detail that [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] described , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] both acknowledged that [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [ORG COLOMBO  ] 00000830 003 OF 003 have at least some involvement with the [ORG LTTE  ] through the [ORG TRO  ] . 
Our sense is that the money derived from these charities probably goes to fund the [ORG LTTE  ] administration in the territory it occupies , rather than arms purchases . 
The [MISC LTTE’s  ] internal revenues are likely minuscule compared with what it raises abroad from the [MISC Tamil  ] [PER Diaspora  ] . 
It is probably these overseas revenues that are used to purchase arms for import into the [PER Vanni  ] .
