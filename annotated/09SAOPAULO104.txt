BRASILIA  ] 73 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
[ORG SAOPAULO  ] 31 Classified By: Consul General [PER Thomas White  ] ; Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] met with [ORG Embraer  ] CEO [PER Federico Curado  ] on January 30 to discuss [PER Curado  ] 's views on the [MISC FX2  ] sale , as well hear about how the financial crisis has affected the company 's sales . 
[PER Curado  ] stressed the political nature of the decision , stating that in addition to technology transfer , one of the primary goals of the Request for Proposal ( [ORG RFP  ] ) was job creation . 
He said this could be achieved through a partnership between [ORG Boeing  ] and [ORG Embraer  ] in the development of a next-generation [MISC Brazilian  ] jet fighter . 
[PER Curado  ] also suggested that the [LOC United States  ] offer to purchase a number of [MISC U.S.-assembled  ] [ORG Embraer  ] Super [MISC Tucanos  ] in exchange for the [MISC FX2  ] contract . 
He thought that tying civilian aviation collaboration with the [MISC FX2  ] sale was too complicated and too far off . 
Regarding the financial crisis , he told Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] that [ORG Embraer  ] has suffered tremendously , and expects [ORG Embraer  ] 's production to fall significantly after it works through its current backlog . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Curado  ] emphasized the importance of the political dimension of this decision . 
He said that even if [LOC Brazil  ] received full technology transfer , this would not achieve what he sees as one of the principal goals of the program , job creation . 
[PER Curado  ] explained that building a jet fighter is a difficult process and that the only way to truly learn how to build a plane is to develop the aircraft from the very beginning . 
Not even technology transfer can accomplish this , because " it is through trial and error that a company learns how to actually build an aircraft . 
" In [PER Curado  ] 's view , the [ORG GOB  ] ultimately wants to create jobs from this sale and to do so , they need a partner who can work with [ORG Embraer  ] to develop a next-generation aircraft in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[ORG Embraer  ] would like [ORG Boeing  ] to be that partner. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG Embraer  ] proposed matching the sale of the [MISC F-18s  ] with a comparable purchase of [ORG Embraer  ] Super [MISC Tucanos  ] , assembled at the [ORG Embraer  ] facility in [LOC Florida  ] . 
[PER Curado  ] cited this as a creative way to add value to the [ORG Boeing  ] bid . 
This promise would , in his view , be a convincing step in the [ORG GOB  ] 's decision . 
[PER Curado  ] then stated that [ORG Embraer  ] privately hopes [ORG Boeing  ] wins the contract , though publicly they must remain neutral . 
He finally asked Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] to avoid discussions of civilian aviation collaboration , which he said could confuse the selection process for the [MISC FX2.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) According to [PER Curado  ] , the financial crisis has brought [ORG Embraer  ] 's new sales to zero . 
They are working through a backlog of planes , but in two to three years , [PER Curado  ] expects to have completed the backlog , leaving [ORG Embraer  ] with no planes to produce . 
He told Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] that he expects the crisis to have abated in three to four years , though he foresees further depreciation of assets worldwide . 
He said that some clients have canceled contracts , despite losing deposits as high as 40 percent of the value of the plane . 
NOTE: This differs from [PER Curado  ] 's public statements that do not paint such a bleak picture . 
In fact , [PER Curado  ] told a visiting Codel on January 29 that sales remain strong for certain classes of aircraft and that few of their clients have canceled orders . 
END NOTE. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) COMMENT: Defense officials have told the [ORG Mission  ] that creation of a domestic arms industry is an essential part of the bidding process ( [ORG REF  ] A ) . 
The head of the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] has said that he prefers the [MISC F-18  ] , and most experts believe it to be technologically superior ( [ORG REF  ] B ) . 
[PER Curado  ] concurred that both technology transfer and job creation are key aspects of the [ORG RFP  ] . 
As it stands , the [ORG RFP  ] calls for a relatively small number of planes ( 36 ) , and [ORG Boeing  ] officials have told [ORG Embraer  ] that it is not economical [ORG SAO PAULO  ] 00000104 002 OF 002 to assemble or manufacture [MISC F-18s  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
This fact would not allow for the creation of significant numbers of jobs in [LOC Brazil  ] , something that [PER Curado  ] and [ORG Embraer  ] see as key to winning the contract . 
However , if [ORG Boeing  ] and [ORG Embraer  ] were to partner in the development of a [MISC Brazilian  ] next-generation jet fighter , the technology transfer and job creation concerns would be addressed , and potentially make [ORG Boeing  ] 's bid for the [MISC FX2  ] more likely to succeed . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
This cable was coordinated / cleared by [ORG Embassy Brasilia  ] and Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] .
