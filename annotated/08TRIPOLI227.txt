End summary . 
OIL WEALTH A MIXED BLESSING THAT NECESSITATES CHANGE 2 . 
( U ) In a speech delivered on March 2 to the annual session of the General People 's [ORG Congress  ] in [ORG Sirte  ] , [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] decried the failure of the General People 's [ORG Committees  ] to effectively distribute [LOC Libya  ] 's oil wealth to its people . 
While the 1969 revolution was initially successful in reclaiming [LOC Libya  ] 's oil wealth for ordinary [MISC Libyans  ] , widespread corruption and failed implementation at all levels of government had engendered widespread dissatisfaction with public services , especially education , health , and infrastructure development . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] , claiming [MISC Arab  ] governments in oil-rich states that failed to fairly dispense oil wealth risk being toppled by their own people in the near future , said increased oil prices made the cost of the General People 's [MISC Committees'  ] ( [ORG GPC  ] 's ) failure to effectively distribute the nation 's oil wealth increasingly untenable . 
( ANOTHER ) RADICAL RESTRUCTURING OF GOVERNMENT IN THE OFFING 3 . 
( C ) [PER Qadhafi  ] called on the [ORG Congress  ] to abolish by year 's end the system of the [ORG GPC  ] 's , which has constituted the de facto government structure since the late 1970 's , and to instead directly transfer [LOC Libya  ] 's oil revenues " to the people " . 
Contacts at the [ORG MFA  ] and [ORG Central Bank  ] recently told us that five [ORG GOL  ] committees - responsible for the budget , economy , administrative structure , wealth distribution and legal reform - were quickly constituted after [PER Qadhafi  ] 's speech to formulate plans for dismantling the [ORG GPC  ] 's , standing up alternate structures and implementing direct distribution of oil wealth . 
Final plans for shifting from the [ORG GPC  ] 's to an as-yet undetermined structure are due by September 1 . 
[ORG Central Bank  ] Governor [PER Bengdara  ] told the [ORG CDA  ] March 12 that restructuring of the [ORG GOL  ] would precede privatization of government-owned entities and services such as health , education and utilities . 
SECURITY , FOREIGN POLICY APPARATUS TO REMAIN UNCHANGED 4 . 
( U ) Citing common practice in other countries , [PER Qadhafi  ] identified five key authorities - defense , foreign affairs , interior , internal security and external security - that would remain unchanged , but should report directly to the head of state ( formally the Secretary of the General People 's [ORG Congress  ] ) instead of through the existing structure . 
He noted that , in practice , the [MISC Libyan  ] Prime Minister-equivalent does not and should not exercise oversight over these areas , proposing that they instead be considered as " sovereign ministries " that would report directly to the head of state and not/not through the [ORG GPC  ] 's and the [ORG Secretariat of the General People  ] 's [ORG Congress  ] . 
He proposed an alternative form of military conscription in which all eligible [MISC Libyans  ] would be required to do two-month rotations in the armed forces in lieu of maintaining a standing army . 
DIRECT REDISTRIBUTION OF OIL WEALTH PROPOSED TRIPOLI 00000227 002.2 OF 005 5 . 
( U ) Citing the inability of [ORG GPC  ] 's to effectively distribute [LOC Libya  ] 's oil-generated wealth to its citizens , [PER Qadhafi  ] proposed a redistribution scheme by which half a million [MISC Libyan  ] families , totaling some three million people , will receive monthly stipends representing their share of [LOC Libya  ] 's oil revenues . 
Subsidies for gasoline , food , commodities , health care and education would be eliminated . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] proposed a stipend figure of 5,000 [MISC Libyan  ] dinar ( [ORG LD  ] ) per month ( about $4,000 ) . 
Ironically , the [ORG GPC  ] system whose elimination he advocated will be responsible for developing a mechanism to transfer oil wealth before its demise . 
The [ORG GPC  ] 's annual budget had steadily increased to a peak of $32 billion ( 37 billion [ORG LD  ] ) in 2007 ; budgets under the new distribution system should settle at about 30 billion [ORG LD  ] per year according to [PER Qadhafi  ] . 
( [ORG Note: State-owned  ] media subsequently reported that the 2008 budget would total 49 billion [ORG LD  ] , about $39 billion . 
End note . 
) Saying he had advocated a similar reform package for years , the [MISC Libyan  ] leader argued that if only the [MISC Libyan  ] people had taken his advice in the past , they 'd be rich already . 
WITH CORRESPONDING PRIVATIZATION OF STATE-OWNED/OPERATED SERVICES 6 . 
( U ) Once the [ORG GPC  ] system is dismantled , all spending decisions will devolve to the private sector . 
In lieu of the [ORG GPC  ] structure , [PER Qadhafi  ] suggested the [MISC Libyan  ] people would spontaneously establish " real committees " of around 100 individuals for the purpose of managing private sector economic activity . 
He cautioned that while oil prices are high now , they would not always remain so . 
While acknowledging that most [MISC Libyans  ] would not do so , he encouraged them to save and invest some of their monthly allotment . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] called for the abolishment of all loans , criticizing the [MISC Libyan  ] financial sector both for discriminatory lending practices based on personal and tribal affiliation and for a poor track record on non-performing loans . 
He hinted at the establishment of an individual income tax system . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] spoke at length about the ways in which he perceives the [ORG GOL  ] to be oversized and overextended , citing services such as [ORG HIV/AIDS  ] testing , avian bird flu detection and veterinary care as issues that are beyond the competence of most governments . 
He noted approvingly ( and incorrectly ) that the [LOC U.S.  ] government does not fund cultural programs . 
He focused on radical privatization , stressing health care and education , as the means by which to trim the public sector bloat and further empower the private sector . 
EDUCATION , HEALTH CARE ARE KEY AREAS 7 . 
( U ) [PER Qadhafi  ] spoke at length about education , saying [MISC Libyans  ] will be solely responsible for financing their children 's education , either within [LOC Libya  ] ( by funding school construction and paying teachers' salaries ) or abroad . 
" No one [ in the [MISC Libyan  ] government ] is responsible for [ a child 's ] education , whether locally or abroad , " he said . 
Lamenting the fact that most [MISC Libyan  ] schools lack computers and sufficient numbers of psychiatrists and social workers , he suggested that privately-funded and operated schools might do better . 
He encouraged [MISC Libyans  ] to pay for their children to study abroad if their choice of career required specialized education . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] also said privatization of education would extend to religious education , opining that " you [ the people ] must run the madrassas~ you take those Quranic schools . 
" On health care , the [ORG GOL  ] had invested considerable sums to build hospitals and train medical personnel , but [MISC Libyans  ] complained about the quality of care and traveled abroad whenever possible for medical care . 
By privatizing hospitals , they would now have a chance to directly improve the quality of medical care . 
HOW TO KEEP [MISC LIBYANS  ] WORKING ? 8 . 
( U ) Complaining that annual outlays for government salaries are far too high , [PER Qadhafi  ] called for an end to public sector wages and the abolishment of government-funded pensions and retirement funds . 
( [ORG Note: The Central Bank  ] Governor told the [ORG CDA  ] salary outlays officially totaled about 10 billion [ORG LD  ] , but suggested the real number is higher . 
End note . 
) He noted the [MISC Libyan  ] people would " need to think about " how to create incentives for employees in key public functions , such as security and defense , to continue working if they're receiving the same monthly stipend as everyone else . 
He speculated that some security functions might eventually be filled with volunteers . 
[ORG QADHAFI ROLLS  ] THE DICE .. . 
AGAIN 9 . 
( C ) [PER Qadhafi  ] 's plan for restructuring the [ORG GOL  ] and privatizing [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000227 003.2 OF 005 the majority of state-owned and operated services could represent his most radical experiment in governance since the introduction of the [ORG GPC  ] 's and subsequent establishment of the [ORG Revolutionary Committees  ] in the late 1970 's . 
Conceding that the speech was " substantially different " than anything anyone expected ( see reftel for Post 's preview of the General People 's [ORG Congress  ] ) , [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] ( [ORG QDF  ] ) Director Dr. [PER Yusuf Sawani  ] told P/E Chief March 3 that the " dramatic initiatives " were designed to " radically accelerate " government and economic reform , and to open further space for civil society actors . 
MFA Secretary for the [ORG Americas Dr.  ] [PER Ahmed Fituri  ] told the [ORG CDA  ] March 5 that Secretary of the [ORG GPC  ] for Manpower , Employment and Training [PER Matuq Matuq  ] - a member of one of the implementing committees - called him shortly after [PER Qadhafi  ] 's speech asking for details about the [LOC U.S.  ] system of local , state and federal governance . 
[PER Fituri  ] said [PER Qadhafi  ] , frustrated by the " bulky and non-responsive " [ORG GOL  ] , had suggested the [LOC U.S.  ] system , including independent federal agencies such as the [ORG EPA  ] , as a possible model . 
[PER Fituri  ] told the [ORG CDA  ] he threw cold water on the idea in his conversation with [PER Matuq  ] , cautioning that the [LOC U.S.  ] system was too complex to be effectively replicated in [LOC Libya  ] . 
MUCH ACTIVITY .. . 
10 . 
( C ) The [ORG Ministry of Economy and Trade  ] 's Director of Foreign Trade , [PER Dia Hammouda  ] , told Emboffs March 12 that the [ORG GOL  ] 's most senior leaders are focused on implementing the " drastic " plan . 
The five committees responsible for the budget , economy , government/administrative structure , wealth distribution and legal reform comprise the Secretary of the General People 's [ORG Congress  ] ( head of state equivalent ) , his deputy , the Prime Minister-equivalent , his deputy and secretaries ( minister equivalents ) for the relevant General People 's Committees . 
The committees have been meeting " continuously " since the March 2 speech to develop recommendations for implementing the plan . 
A session to review initial plans and recommendations is scheduled for early next week . 
Conceding that the changes represented a serious political gamble , [PER Hammouda  ] cited a [MISC Libyan  ] proverb: " From [LOC Libya  ] comes the new " . .. . 
BUT HOW MUCH REAL MOVEMENT ? 11 . 
( C ) Nonetheless , it remains unclear how extensive the change will really be . 
[PER Abdulati Obeidi  ] , MFA Secretary for [MISC European  ] Affairs , told the visiting [PER Lord Mayor  ] of [LOC London  ] on March 8 that the biggest shift could be expanding the power of the Prime Minister-equivalent 's office to include " subcommittees " for issues such as health , education and infrastructure that would create policy " at the strategic level " . 
Various [ORG GOL  ] contacts have speculated that the existing [ORG GPC  ] structures could remain essentially intact , but under different names and under different lines of authority , with the power of a more formalized executive in the form of a strengthened PM-equivalent 's office . 
Underscoring the fact that real change may be slower in coming than the impatient [PER Qadhafi  ] would like , Deputy Foreign Minister-equivalent [PER Muhammad Siala  ] , whose position was summarily abolished along with all other deputy [ORG GPC  ] secretary slots , remains in his office and is " carrying on as SIPDIS normal " , at least for now . 
" SOVEREIGN MINISTRIES " AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF REALITY 12 . 
( C ) MFA [ORG Americas Desk  ] Director [PER Muhammad Matari  ] told P/E Chief that creating the proposed five " sovereign ministries " could greatly diminish the authority of the General People 's [ORG Congress  ] in foreign policy and security issues . 
The general who heads the [ORG Support Division  ] of the [ORG Ministry of Interior-equivalent  ] told P/E Chief on March 6 that establishing foreign affairs , defense and security services as exceptions to the new rule reflected the reality that the regime rests on " the pillar of security " . 
It was fine to tinker with social engineering in civilian ministries , but " everyone " understood that at its core the regime depended on the foreign affairs , defense and security organizations because " [LOC Libya  ] is not an inherently stable country " . 
5,000 [ORG LD  ] ALLOTMENT " AN EXAMPLE " ; [ORG CENTRAL BANK CONCERNED ABOUT INFLATION  ] 13 . 
( C ) Noting that the figure of 5,000 [ORG LD  ] was " an example " of the amount of direct oil wealth transfers that might be settled on , [ORG Central Bank  ] Chairman [PER Bengdara  ] stressed to the [ORG CDA  ] on March 11 concerns about inflation . 
He had instead proposed that stocks and shares in government-owned companies and investment funds comprise some or all of the distribution package . 
Citing [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000227 004.2 OF 005 Libyans' penchant for consumer spending and lack of financial discipline , he fretted that many [MISC Libyans  ] would fail to save and invest , limiting non-oil sector economic growth and leaving many without cash reserves if oil prices and monthly allotments dropped . 
[MISC Libyans  ] are " much more like [MISC Italians  ] than like the [MISC British  ] " in wanting to spend rather than save , he said . 
Stressing the enormity of the proposed changes , [PER Bengdara  ] said that while [PER Qadhafi  ] wanted changes implemented " very soon " , a realistic timeline for implementation was 10 years . 
Overly rapid privatization would be disastrous ; privatization would need to be carefully sequenced with government restructuring to be effective . 
SITUATION REGARDING QADHAFI'S SONS UNCLEAR 14 . 
( C ) As reported ref A , observers hoped results of the [ORG Congress  ] would signal the relative positions of [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi and his recently ascendant brother , [PER Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi , the two sons of Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] widely considered to be rivals to succeed their father . 
In typical [PER Qadhafi  ] fashion , results of the [ORG Congress  ] are unclear . 
[PER Muatassim  ] , as [ORG National Security Adviser  ] , is the only [PER Qadhafi  ] son formally represented on the new administrative structure committee , potentially the most important of the five committees tasked with restructuring the government . 
But two key members of the General People 's [ORG Congress  ] ( [ORG Parliament-equivalent  ] ) viewed as [PER Muatassim  ] allies - former Secretary of the [ORG GPC  ] Zanati [PER Ahmed Zanati  ] ( Speaker of the [ORG Parliament-equivalent  ] ) and Deputy Secretary of the [ORG GPC Ahmed Ibrahim  ] - lost their seats , calling SIPDIS into question how much [PER Muatassim  ] really gained . 
15 . 
( C ) In addition , xxxxxxxxxxxx who works with [LOC Libya  ] 's economic and financial sectors told EconOff March 11 that Dr. [PER Mahmoud Jibril  ] , head of the [ORG National Planning Commission  ] , ally of [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam and a leading advocate for economic reform , would play a key role on three of the five implementing committees - budget , economy and wealth distribution . 
[PER Jibril  ] , who as recently as early February was so frustrated by his inability to effect reform that he had submitted letters of resignation on three occasions , is reportedly now convinced that [PER Qadhafi  ] 's commitment to dramatic change is sincere enough that he has agreed to stay on - for now . 
16 . 
( C ) xxxxxxxxxxxx offered a different interpretation , telling the [ORG CDA  ] that [PER Qadhafi  ] 's proposed changes had effectively created areas in which the three leading sons ( [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam , [PER Muatassim  ] , and [LOC Khamis  ] , an army officer ) could play key roles . 
By differentiating between economic/social areas of governance ( [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam 's purview ) and " sovereign ministries " divided between security organizations ( [PER Muatassim  ] ) and defense ( [LOC Khamis  ] ) , [PER Qadhafi  ] had avoided signaling which son is the leading contender to succeed him . 
Reiterating remarks in the run-up to the [ORG Congress  ] , businessman [PER Zahri Muntasser  ] told P/E Chief March 13 that the " changes " effectively extended [PER Qadhafi  ] 's hedge of his December 2003 " strategic bet " to give up [ORG WMD  ] and terrorism by fostering the perception that a traditional " strong man " ( [PER Muatassim  ] or [LOC Khamis  ] ) , vice the more reformist [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam , could take - or at least share - the reins of power . 
BUSINESS COMMUNITY CONFUSED 17 . 
( C ) Business figures concerned by contradictory signals in late 2007 about the [ORG GOL  ] 's commitment to economic reform and hopeful that the [ORG Congress  ] would clarify the situation ( reftel ) similarly argue the situation is now more confused than before . 
Rather than proceeding with measured reform within the existing structure while solidifying economic reform , [PER Qadhafi  ] was trying to " change everything at once " . 
Frustrated by what he perceived to be " juvenile impatience " , leading businessman xxxxxxxxxxxx ( strictly protect ) decried to P/E Chief the idea that the [ORG GOL  ] could undertake wholesale structural reform and simultaneously manage the massive infrastructure and development programs it is trying to complete in time for the 40th anniversary of the revolution on September 1 , 2009 . 
Trying to undertake extensive political and economic reform simultaneously was " a recipe for disaster " , he said. xxxxxxxxxxxx told P/E Chief he had been " disappointed " by the speech and was inclined to continue waiting to see how the changes played out before deciding to undertake any further investment . 
18 . 
( C ) Comment: This year 's General People 's [ORG Congress  ] was closely watched for signs of the regime 's commitment to economic and limited political reform . 
In classic fashion , [PER Qadhafi  ] [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000227 005.2 OF 005 surprised everyone with his call for a dramatic restructuring of [LOC Libya  ] 's existing political and economic system . 
His tone and language were petulant , reflecting clear frustration that the [ORG GPC  ] system ( of which he was the architect ) had so demonstrably failed , but also with the complaints of [MISC Libyan  ] citizens about the [LOC Jamahiriya  ] 's shortcomings , particularly in the areas of education and health care . 
Reminded of the difficult days of the 1980 's and early 1990 's , when revolutionary zeal was at its peak , some contacts have expressed concern that the speech portends a return to the turbulent experimentalism of the past . 
The angry tone and specific proposals are more consistent with yesteryear [PER Qadhafi  ] offerings than with the philosopher-king image he has cultivated more recently. xxxxxxxxxxxx flatly told the [ORG CDA  ] that many [MISC Libyans  ] found [PER Qadhafi  ] 's remarks " un-statesmanlike " . 
19 . 
( C ) Comment ( continued ) : More significant than the jarring tone was [PER Qadhafi  ] 's seemingly contradictory mix of uber-libertarianism and old school revolutionary speak . 
Points blasting [MISC U.S.-style  ] democracy as " falsifying the true will of the people " and lauding the [LOC Jamahiriya  ] 's " state of the masses " as a superior model came hard on the heels of remarks decrying the failure of the [ORG GPC  ] 's and a call for the complete privatization of [LOC Libya  ] 's socio-economic structure , a marked shift from the pseudo-socialist egalitarianism of old . 
Perhaps most importantly , the proposed changes would strike a direct blow at the tacit pact - cradle-to-grave subsidies financed by oil revenues in exchange for political quiescence - that has undergirded the regime for decades . 
Libyans' cautious optimism about receiving sizeable monthly allotments of oil revenues has been tempered by real concern about the practicalities of self-financing virtually every aspect of their lives . 
How aggressively the regime implements the proposed changes - it wouldn't be the first time [PER Qadhafi  ] 's dramatic calls for change ended up being a tempest in a teacup - could determine how much more old guard elements already dissatisfied with what they perceive to be too much change are willing to take . 
The inclusion of more conservative individuals such as former Secretary for Manpower , Employment and Training [PER Matuq Matuq  ] and [ORG SIPDIS National Security Adviser  ] [PER Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi on the key administrative structure committee charged with implementing government re-structuring suggests an attempt to balance competing reformist and traditional constituencies . 
In the end , [PER Qadhafi  ] 's speech brings to mind the recent comment of an [ORG MFA  ] official: " We don't have a government here ... we have something else " . 
End comment .
