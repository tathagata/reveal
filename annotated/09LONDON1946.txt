( C/NF ) Summary . 
The [ORG Scottish Government  ] severely underestimated the both [LOC USG  ] and [LOC UK  ] public reaction to its decision to grant compassionate release to convicted [MISC Pan Am 103  ] bomber [PER Abdel Basset  ] al-Megrahi on August 20 . 
[MISC Scottish  ] First Minister [PER Alex Salmond  ] has privately indicated that he was “shocked” by [ORG FBI  ] Director Mueller’s public letter . 
The media continue to report [LOC U.S.  ] anger over the decision , and concern [LOC Scotland  ] will be targeted economically , through reduced [LOC U.S.  ] tourism and whiskey boycotts . 
The media speculate that the [ORG UK Government  ] had a hand in the deal to maintain good diplomatic relations with [LOC Libya  ] and secure oil and gas deals , which the [ORG UK Government  ] has denied as “completely wrong” and “offensive.” Today ( August 24 ) , the [ORG Scottish Parliament  ] meets to hear [MISC Scottish  ] Justice Minister [PER Kenny MacAskill’s  ] explanation of his decision . 
The media speculates that [MISC Scottish  ] opposition parties , all of which are on record condemning the decision , may move against the [ORG Scottish National Party’s  ] ( [ORG SNP  ] ) minority government in a vote of no confidence , though the two-thirds majority required to secure such a move would be very difficult to obtain . 
Prime Minister [PER Gordon Brown  ] has not yet made a statement on Megrahi’s release , with other Cabinet members maintaining that it was a decision for the devolved [ORG Scottish Government  ] . 
Given growing discontent and speculation about a [ORG UK Government  ] hand in the deal , [PER Brown  ] may have to make a statement soon . 
Meanwhile , local [MISC Scottish  ] opposition politicians are using the issue to call into question the [ORG SNP  ] government’s credibility and competence . 
End summary . 
Reaction to [MISC USG Statements  ] -------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) The [LOC UK  ] media have widely reported on [ORG FBI  ] Director Mueller’s letter to [PER MacAskill  ] and Chairman of the Joint Chief of [ORG Staff Admiral  ] Mullen’s comments on the [ORG Scottish Government’s  ] decision to grant compassionate release to convicted [MISC Pan Am 103  ] bomber [PER Abdel Basset  ] al-Megrahi . 
Washington-based [ORG Scottish Government  ] Representative [PER Robin Naysmith  ] told [ORG CG Edinburgh  ] Sunday , August 24 that [MISC Scottish  ] First Minister [PER Salmond  ] was “shocked” by Mueller’s comments , which were “over the top” given that President [PER Obama  ] had already commented on the decision . 
[PER Naysmith  ] underscored that [LOC Scotland  ] received “nothing” for releasing [PER Megrahi  ] ( as has been widely suggested in the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] media ) , while the [ORG UK Government  ] has gotten everything - a chance to stick it to Salmond’s [ORG Scottish National Party  ] ( [ORG SNP  ] ) and good relations with [LOC Libya  ] . 
( NOTE: We expect [PER Naysmith  ] to be engaging heavily in [LOC Washington  ] on these issues . 
END NOTE . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) The media have also reported growing concerns that [MISC American  ] anger over the decision will translate into a boycott of [MISC Scottish  ] whiskey and reduced [MISC American  ] tourism in [LOC Scotland  ] , an approximately USD 416 million business annually . 
In a previous meeting with [ORG CG Edinburgh  ] on Friday , August 21 , [PER Salmond  ] reiterated that he and his government “had played straight” with both the [MISC USG  ] and [ORG UK Government  ] , but implied that the [ORG UK Government  ] had not . 
During the meeting , which occurred before the [PER Mueller  ] and [PER Mullen  ] statements , he said he wanted to move beyond the [PER Megrahi  ] issue and deepen Scotland’s relationship with the [LOC USG  ] . 
He said the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Government  ] had offered the [ORG Scottish Government  ] “a parade of treats , ” all of which were turned down . 
( NOTE: Roughly fifty percent of [MISC Scottish  ] exports go to the [LOC U.S.  ] , and over 450 [LOC U.S.  ] businesses employ over 100,000 [MISC Scots  ] in [LOC Scotland  ] . 
END NOTE . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Scottish Government  ] statements , including those from [PER Salmond  ] , have acknowledged the “strongly-held views of the [MISC American  ] families , ” but underscored that those views are not shared by all of the victims’ families ( referring primarily to the [MISC British  ] families ) . 
[PER Salmond  ] defended the decision , saying it was “right in terms of ( the [MISC Scottish  ] ) legal system” and “what ( they ) are duty-bound to do.” [PER Salmond  ] is also reported in the media to have said that the [LOC USG  ] had made clear that , while it opposed Megrahi’s release , it regarded freeing him on compassionate grounds “far preferable” to a transfer under the [ORG Prisoner Transfer Agreement  ] ( [ORG PTA  ] ) . 
( NOTE: While indicating the [MISC USG’s  ] preference for compassionate release over a [ORG PTA  ] transfer , as described in reftel B , Salmond’s statement does not mention the [MISC USG’s  ] strong opposition to any release , particularly one that would allow [PER Megrahi  ] to travel outside of [LOC Scotland  ] . 
END NOTE . 
) [ORG Scottish Parliament Holds Emergency Session  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Scottish Parliament  ] holds an emergency session Monday at 1430 local time ( August 24 ) , calling on [MISC Scottish  ] Justice Minister [PER Kenny MacAskill  ] to explain his decision . 
All three opposition parties in [LOC Scotland  ] ( [ORG Labour  ] , [ORG Conservatives  ] , and the [MISC Liberal Democrats  ] ) have condemned the minority [ORG Scottish National Party  ] ( [ORG SNP  ] ) government’s decision to release [PER Megrahi  ] . 
The media openly speculate that a vote of no confidence will occur if [PER MacAskill  ] does not resign , but it would be difficult for opposition parties to garner the two-thirds majority required ( 87 of the 129 seats ) , if the [ORG SNP  ] is able to maintain control of its 47 Members of [ORG Scottish Parliament  ] ( [ORG MSPs  ] ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Scottish  ] opposition political figures , like [ORG Scottish Labour  ] leader [PER Iain Gray  ] and former [MISC Scottish  ] First Minister [PER Jack McConnell  ] , have condemned the decision to release [PER Megrahi  ] , calling it a “grave error of judgment.” [ORG Scottish Liberal Democrat  ] leader [PER Tavis Scott  ] said , “The SNP’s credibility at home and abroad is in tatters . 
Scotland’s must not be allowed to follow with it.” Compassionate Release for Oil and Gas ? -------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC UK  ] media widely speculates that the [ORG UK Government  ] had a hand in the decision to release [PER Megrahi  ] in order to maintain good diplomatic relations with the [MISC Libyans  ] and to secure oil and gas deals , citing the now infamous 2004 “deal in the desert” between former PM [PER Blair  ] and [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Qaddafi  ] , recent meetings and correspondence between PM [PER Brown  ] and “Muammar , ” a recent meeting between Business Secretary [PER Lord Mandelson  ] and Qaddafi’s son [PER Saif  ] al-Islam , and other high-level trade delegations . 
Qaddafi’s personal thanks to [PER Brown  ] , the Queen , and the [ORG British Government  ] after embracing [PER Megrahi  ] in a televised statement have fanned the flames and increased calls for [PER Brown  ] to explain the UK’s involvement in the decision-making process . 
[PER Mandelson  ] insisted to the media that it is “completely wrong” and “offensive” to suggest that Megrahi’s release was linked to trade deals . 
A [ORG Foreign Office  ] contact reiterated to [MISC Poloff  ] August 24 that such speculation is “completely absurd.” He acknowledged that the [MISC Libyans  ] had raised [PER Megrahi  ] at every turn in their burgeoning diplomatic relationship , but said that Megrahi’s release was “never directly or implicitly” linked to any deal . 
[ORG UK Government  ] Reaction ---------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) Prime Minister [PER Gordon Brown  ] , who is currently on holiday in [LOC Scotland  ] , has refrained from comment . 
Acting PM Chancellor [PER Alistair Darling  ] has said , “you either devolve the responsibility for criminal justice or you don’t , ” a position that Foreign Secretary [PER Miliband  ] supported in interviews on Friday , August 21 . 
[PER Miliband  ] affirmed that “the sight of a a mass-murderer getting a hero’s welcome in [LOC Tripoli  ] is deeply upsetting , deeply distressing.” [MISC Conservative  ] leader [PER David Cameron  ] has sent [PER Brown  ] a public message condemning the decision and calling on [PER Brown  ] to “make clear his own views” on the decision . 
[LOC UK-Libya  ] -------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) [ORG Foreign Office North Africa  ] team leader [PER Rob Dixon  ] told [MISC Poloff  ] August 24 that the [LOC UK  ] has been telling the [MISC Libyan  ] Government , through [PER Saif  ] al-Islam and the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] , that the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Government’s  ] handling of its September 1 national day festivities will determine the future of the [LOC UK-Libya  ] bilateral relationship . 
[PER Dixon  ] explained that the [LOC UK  ] has explicitly told the [MISC Libyans  ] that [PER Megrahi  ] should not be featured in any high-profile way . 
He said that the [LOC UK  ] has also told the [MISC Libyans  ] that Qaddafi’s personal thanks to PM [PER Brown  ] and the Queen were “unhelpful” and the [ORG UK Government’s  ] “unhappiness” had been communicated “in clear terms.” [PER Dixon  ] said the [ORG Foreign Office  ] will take stock after the September 1 festivities . 
[LOC UK-Scotland  ] ----------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Dixon  ] termed “absurd” [MISC MacAskill’s  ] comment ( in his original August 20 statement about Megrahi’s release ) that the [ORG UK Government’s  ] refusal to make representations was “highly regrettable.” Referring to [MISC MacAskill’s  ] welcoming of a public inquiry into the case , [PER Dixon  ] said such an undertaking would be “nearly impossible” given the way devolution works . 
[PER Dixon  ] implied that the comments were designed to blame the [ORG UK Government  ] for putting the [MISC Scots  ] in a position to have to make a decision . 
[PER Dixon  ] told [MISC Poloff  ] on August 24 that the [ORG Foreign Office  ] had had no contact with the [ORG Scottish Government  ] since the decision was announced . 
Comment ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C/NF ) It is clear that the [ORG Scottish Government  ] underestimated the blow-back it would receive in response to Megrahi’s release and is now trying to paint itself as the victim . 
It seems likely , especially given the increasing speculation that the [ORG UK Government  ] had a hand in the decision , that Prime Minister [PER Brown  ] will have to address the issue publicly . 
Meanwhile , local [MISC Scottish  ] opposition politicians are trying to undercut the [ORG SNP  ] minority government’s credibility as much as possible. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 .
