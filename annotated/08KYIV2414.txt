( [ORG S  ] ) Summary and [ORG Comment: Controversial  ] [MISC Ukrainian  ] oligarch [PER Dmytro Firtash  ] , best known as co-owner of gas intermediary [ORG RosUkrEnergo  ] ( [ORG RUE  ] ) , called upon the Ambassador on December 8 . 
[PER Firtash  ] did not explicitly state why he requested the meeting , nor did he ask the USG for anything , but he spoke at length about his business and politics in a visible effort to improve his image with the USG . 
The soft-spoken billionaire , arguably one of [MISC Ukraine’s  ] most powerful people , expressed strong support for President [PER Yushchenko  ] and equally strong contempt for Prime Minister [PER Tymoshenko  ] .

He acknowledged ties to [MISC Russian  ] organized crime figure [PER Seymon Mogilevich  ] , stating he needed Mogilevich’s approval to get into business in the first place . 
He was adamant that he had not committed a single crime when building his business empire , and argued that outsiders still failed to understand the period of lawlessness that reigned in [LOC Ukraine  ] after the collapse of the [LOC Soviet Union  ] . 
He said he cared truly about [LOC Ukraine  ] , and saw [MISC Russian  ] business interests overtaking the economy as the biggest threat to the country’s security . 
[ORG Comment: Firtash’s  ] arguments and allegations are clearly self-interested ; he sees [PER Tymoshenko  ] as a clear threat to his business . 
End summary and comment . 
[PER Firtash  ] Seeks to Improve His Image ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC Ukrainian  ] billionaire [PER Dmytro Firtash  ] , best known as co-owner of controversial gas intermediary [ORG RUE  ] , sought a meeting with the Ambassador on December 8 . 
Accompanying [PER Firtash  ] to the meeting was political consultant and [PER AmCit Zev Furst  ] , and [PER Andras Knopp  ] , the [MISC Hungarian-born  ] number two at [ORG RUE  ] . 
[PER Firtash  ] never specifically stated why he had sought the meeting , nor did he extend any specific requests to the Ambassador , but in the course of the conversation it was clear he tried to use the meeting to portray a positive image of himself . 
[PER Furst  ] said he was attending as a “friend and advisor” to [PER Firtash  ] and during the course of the meeting stated that the USG might have misperceptions about [PER Firtash  ] . 
At one point during the meeting , [PER Firtash  ] began to talk about “mistakes he might have made , ” but diverted the conversation when [PER Furst  ] waved him off . 
[ORG Firtash’s Support  ] for President [PER Yushchenko...  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In the meeting , which lasted two and a half hours , [PER Firtash  ] told the Ambassador that he was not a public person , but had recently been pulled deeper into [MISC Ukrainian  ] politics . 
He admitted that he has “loyally served” as an unofficial advisor to President [PER Yushchenko  ] during tense gas negotiations with [LOC Russia  ] and political crises dating back to the [LOC Orange Revolution  ] in 2004 . 
He reported that he met with the [PER Yushchenko  ] at his dacha ( cottage residence ) three times in the last week at the [MISC President’s  ] request . 
He described himself as a close friend and confidante of the President -- someone the President can trust totally . 
In his view , [PER Yushchenko  ] made a possibly fatal political error during the [LOC Orange Revolution  ] in that he and [PER Tymoshenko  ] propagated the concept of two Ukraines -- an orange , more democratic [LOC Ukraine  ] , and a blue [LOC Ukraine  ] represented by the [ORG Party of Regions  ] ( [ORG PoR  ] ) and more focused towards the status quo . 
He added that this divisiveness throughout [LOC Ukraine  ] is exactly what [LOC Russia  ] hoped to cultivate in order to control [LOC Ukraine  ] . 
[PER Firtash  ] felt the only way to unify [LOC Ukraine  ] during the current political and economic crises was to form a coalition between the [MISC President’s  ] supporters and the [ORG PoR  ] in order to stop what he termed , “Tymoshenko’s plans to offer up the country to [LOC Russia  ] on a silver platter.” ( [MISC Note: On  ] the evening of December 9 , BYuT , Our Ukraine/People’s [ORG Self Defense Party  ] , and the [PER Lytvyn Block  ] formed a coalition , keeping [PER Tymoshenko  ] in power and rebuffing [ORG Firtash’s  ] hopes for a coalition between the [MISC President’s  ] supporters and the [ORG PoR  ] . 
End note . 
) ...And Contempt for [PER Tymoshenko  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Firtash  ] defined [PER Tymoshenko  ] as an accomplished oligarch who had made deals with [LOC Moscow  ] that would leave [LOC Ukraine  ] vulnerable to [MISC Russian  ] oligarchs in the future -- something neither he nor [MISC Ukrainian  ] billionaire and [ORG PoR  ] backer [PER Rinat Akhmetov  ] could stand by and watch happen . 
[PER Firtash  ] referred to [MISC Tymoshenko’s  ] title of “gas princess” as a misnomer ; he explained that [PER Tymoshenko  ] did make lots of money off of a corrupt , perpetual gas debt scheme during the 1990s , but she knew nothing about the gas business . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX to give the false impression that she was not actively involved in business . 
He believed that [MISC Tymoshenko’s  ] hatred for him stems from [MISC Tymoshenko’s  ] missed opportunity to develop her own [ORG RUE  ] back in 2005 , when she was Prime Minister for the first time. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Firtash  ] stated that he felt [LOC Russia  ] was strongly supporting a BYuT and [ORG PoR  ] coalition and that such a coalition was about to be finalized on December 7 , with only [MISC Regions  ] leader [PER Viktor Yanukovych  ] needing to sign . 
He claimed that he torpedoed the coalition at the last moment by convincing [PER Yanukovych  ] that an alliance with [PER Tymoshenko  ] would never last . 
[PER Firtash  ] recounted that on December 6 , [PER Tymoshenko  ] was on nearly every [MISC Ukrainian  ] TV channel and in every newspaper , prophesying that a BYuT and [ORG PoR  ] coalition agreement would be signed on the evening of December 7 . 
[PER Firtash  ] was visibly delighted as he recounted how he used his television station INTER to air an interview in which [PER Yanukovych  ] refuted [MISC Tymoshenko’s  ] claim that a BYuT and [ORG PoR  ] coalition was a done deal ( Ref A ) . 
Responding to a question by the Ambassador on whether he worked with [PER Akhmetov  ] to derail a BYuT/PoR coalition , [PER Firtash  ] said that they had worked separately , even if they were pursuing the same goal. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Firtash  ] said he and [PER Akhmetov  ] both wanted a coalition between the [MISC President’s  ] supporters and the [ORG PoR  ] . 
He claimed that he had brokered a subsequent meeting between [PER Yanukovych  ] and [PER Yushchenko  ] for the evening of December 8 . 
He was not sure if [PER Yanukovych  ] and [PER Yushchenko  ] could form a new coalition , but saw it as the only way out of [MISC Ukraine’s  ] prolonged political strife . 
From [LOC Humble Beginnings...  ] ------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Firtash  ] described himself as a simple person who grew up in the village of [LOC Synkiv  ] in the [LOC Ternopil  ] oblast in [LOC Western Ukraine  ] . 
[PER Firtash  ] explained he had very humble beginnings -- his father taught driver education and his mother worked in a sugar factory . 
He added that since his parents hated communism , they did not benefit from valuable contacts that could have helped him get into a university , which was his childhood dream . 
[PER Firtash  ] said he shared his parents’ disdain for the [MISC Communist  ] party and only agreed to join the [MISC Communist  ] youth movement [ORG Komsomol  ] after being locked in a party member’s office for two days without food or water. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Firtash  ] told the Ambassador he attended an occupational institute before be drafted into the army in 1986 and studied to become a fireman after completing his military service . 
In 1991 , when the [LOC Soviet Union  ] collapsed , [PER Firtash  ] stated his parents thought it was the end of the world and he was concerned about making a living during unpredictable times . 
He added that he felt he was “between two countries -- one that had ended and one that was beginning.” He described his future as unknown , stating he was “living in a country with no laws and no taxes.” [PER Firtash  ] also described himself as a “natural businessman” without a university education who “had a nose” for business opportunities , and who would make the best of the uncertainty. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) ( Note: The [MISC Ukrainian  ] newspaper “Ukrainska [ORG Pravda”  ] researched [ORG Firtash’s  ] life and reported that [PER Firtash  ] was not highly educated , but was a highly decorated soldier who had used his contacts to build a canned goods and dry milk business which shipped goods first to [LOC Uzbekistan  ] . 
According to press reports , [PER Firtash’s  ] first wife and business partner [PER Mariya Kalinovska  ] was given credit for [PER Firtash’s  ] first business success . 
This business then turned into a profitable canned goods production factory and a transportation company registered in [LOC Germany  ] . 
[PER Firtash  ] and [PER Kalinovska  ] were married from 2002-2005 , with [PER Kalinovska  ] reportedly receiving a large divorce settlement , despite efforts by former [ORG Fuel and Energy Minister  ] [PER Yuriy Boyko  ] to misrepresent the true scale of [PER Firtash’s  ] wealth . 
End note . 
) ...To Powerful Oligarch ----------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Firtash  ] gave a detailed account of how he got into the gas business . 
[PER Firtash  ] explained that his food and commodities business , which he started in [LOC Chernivtsi  ] in [LOC Western Ukraine  ] with his wife [PER Mariya  ] , was first called [ORG KMIL  ] , and later expanded into [ORG High Rock Holdings  ] . 
Due to his commodities business , he became acquainted with several powerful business figures from the former [LOC Soviet Union  ] . 
[PER Firtash  ] said he met [MISC Ukrainian  ] businessman [PER Igor Bakai  ] in [LOC Turkmenistan  ] who was selling cars in [LOC Ashgabat  ] , but had bigger plans . 
According to [PER Firtash  ] , [PER Bakai  ] convinced then [MISC Ukrainian  ] President [PER Kravchuk  ] to give him permission to buy gas exclusively for the [MISC Ukrainian  ] market in [LOC Turkmenistan  ] . 
[PER Firtash  ] noted that Bakai’s success also sparked [ORG Firtash’s  ] interest in the gas business . 
( Note: In 1993 [PER Bakai  ] then formed the [MISC Respublika  ] company , which later became [MISC Intergas  ] , which set the precedent for profitable gas trading between [LOC Turkmenistan  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] . 
[PER Bakai  ] would go on to be the first Head of [MISC Ukraine’s  ] state oil and gas company [ORG Naftohaz  ] from 1998-2001 . 
End note . 
) <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) [PER Firtash  ] also described the gas business in [LOC Ukraine  ] during the mid 1990s as particularly dangerous . 
[PER Firtash  ] said that then Prime Minister [PER Pavel Lazarenko  ] had hired criminals to run the [MISC Ukrainian  ] government and used his position as Prime Minister for corruption . 
He added that [PER Tymoshenko  ] headed [ORG Ukrainian Energy Systems  ] , where she earned her fortune . 
[PER Firtash  ] claimed that [PER Lazarenko  ] , [PER Tymoshenko  ] , and [ORG Lazarenko’s Assistant  ] [PER Igor Fisherman  ] divided and conquered the [MISC Ukrainian  ] gas market . 
He stated that [PER Lazarenko  ] ordered the killings of [LOC Donetsk  ] Governor [PER Yevgen Scherban  ] in 1996 and the head of [ORG Itera  ] in [LOC Kyiv  ] for not sharing [MISC Lazarenko’s  ] gas business philosophy . 
( Note: [PER Igor Fisherman  ] was known in the [MISC Ukrainian  ] press as Mogilevich’s right hand man who was also [ORG High Rock Holding’s  ] financial director during the late 1990s . 
End note . 
) <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Another such businessman was [PER Igor Makarov  ] , who founded the [ORG Itera  ] gas trading company in 1992 , which provided [MISC Turkmen  ] gas to former [MISC Soviet  ] republics . 
[PER Firtash  ] claimed that [PER Makarov  ] hired a former [ORG KGB  ] head as his security chief to direct [MISC Makarov’s  ] gas trading empire in [LOC Central Asia  ] . 
[PER Firtash  ] recounted that he gave [ORG Itera  ] food commodities through [ORG High Rock Holdings  ] , which [ORG Itera  ] used to buy gas in-kind from [LOC Turkmenistan  ] . 
[PER Makarov  ] then paid [PER Firtash  ] in cash with the proceeds of his gas sales . 
According to [PER Firtash  ] , [PER Makarov  ] refused to pay [PER Firtash  ] $50 million in 2001 , which drove [PER Firtash  ] to explore his own gas trading business , ousting [PER Makarov  ] at the same time. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) According to [PER Firtash  ] , he hired [MISC Hungarian-born  ] businessman [PER Andras Knopp  ] to negotiate new gas trading deals with [LOC Kazakhstan  ] , [LOC Turkmenistan  ] and [LOC Uzbekistan  ] . 
Since these [MISC Central Asian  ] countries trusted [PER Firtash  ] as a reputable businessman , they agreed to sign with [PER Firtash’s EuroTransGas  ] ( [ORG ETG  ] ) company , leaving [MISC Makarov’s  ] business in ruins. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( S ) [PER Firtash  ] also recounted that [PER Makarov  ] invited him to dinner in [LOC Kyiv  ] in January 2002 , shortly after [PER Firtash  ] had signed the gas deals with [LOC Central Asia  ] . 
[PER Firtash  ] added he went to that dinner not knowing if he would be beaten up or even killed for having taken [MISC Makarov’s  ] business from him . 
According to [PER Firtash  ] , [PER Makarov  ] was there with his head of security , [PER Semyon Mogilevich  ] , [PER Sergei Mikhas  ] , from the [ORG Solnstevo Brotherhood  ] , and a Mr. Overin when [PER Makarov  ] told [PER Firtash  ] he would regain his gas business as easily as [PER Firtash  ] had taken it away . 
[PER Firtash  ] walked away from the meeting alive , and credited his ability to keep his life and his gas business to his good reputation among [MISC Central Asian  ] leaders. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) According to [PER Firtash  ] , by 2002 , [ORG ETG  ] was the sole transporter of [MISC Turkmen  ] gas to [LOC Ukraine  ] . 
( Note: According to media reports , by 2005 [PER Firtash  ] had already created a gas trading empire that allowed him to easily transition into [ORG RUE  ] . 
In addition , [PER Firtash  ] owns majority shares in companies in [LOC Ukraine  ] , [LOC Estonia  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC Switzerland  ] , [LOC Italy  ] , [LOC Tajikistan  ] , and [LOC Austria  ] all under the umbrella of the Group DF which he formed in 2007 ( Ref B ) . 
He also owns 61% of the [ORG Ukrainian Inter Media Group  ] which owns or co-owns 7 television channels and the [ORG Ukrainian News Agency  ] . 
By 2006 , Firtash’s estimated worth was over $5 billion , but most experts believe that [PER Firtash  ] had low-balled his true worth and estimated it was in the tens of billions . 
In his conversation with the Ambassador , [PER Firtash  ] gave no indication of the scope of his wealth .

The Future of [ORG RosUkrEnergo  ] ( [ORG RUE  ] ) -------------------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) When asked about Tymoshenko’s promise to rid [LOC Ukraine  ] of [ORG RUE  ] , [PER Firtash  ] responded by making a link between [PER Tymoshenko  ] and [LOC Russia  ] . 
He argued that the Prime Minister was seeking [MISC Russian  ] support to get rid of [ORG RUE  ] , and was making concessions to [LOC Russia  ] to accomplish this goal . 
He specifically cited what he said was her silence on the August events in [LOC Georgia  ] , her avoidance of a stand on the [LOC Holodomor  ] and the issue of the [LOC Black Sea Fleet  ] in [LOC Crimea  ] , as examples of the political concessions she was making to [LOC Moscow  ] . 
[PER Firtash  ] acknowledged that he was having more and more problems with [LOC Russia  ] . 
He alleged that the [MISC Russians  ] had already excused a $600 million debt that she owed from her previous gas business that could be used as pressure to get concessions from her . 
If [LOC Moscow  ] really wanted to get rid of [ORG RUE  ] , [PER Firtash  ] added , it could do so as long as [PER Tymoshenko  ] was at the helm. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Responding to the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] question , [PER Firtash  ] said Ukraine’s current gas debt to [ORG RUE  ] was near $3 billion , adding that the debt was owed directly to [ORG RUE  ] and not to [ORG Gazprom  ] . 
In his view , [LOC Ukraine  ] could only clear the debt to [ORG RUE  ] in gas since it didn’t have enough cash to pay outright . 
He added that according to the [ORG RUE  ] charter with [ORG Gazprom  ] , any shipments or supplies of gas to [ORG RUE  ] must be confirmed by two signatures on a gas transfer document -- one signature from [ORG Gazprom  ] -- the other from [ORG RUE  ] ( [PER Firtash  ] ) . 
[PER Firtash  ] argued that if he does not sign the gas transfer document , then legally there is no proof that gas has been supplied to [ORG RUE  ] or [LOC Ukraine  ] , so [ORG Gazprom  ] forfeits its ability to demand payment from [ORG RUE  ] , thus keeping [ORG RUE  ] in the gas arrangement for some time . 
He estimated that [LOC Ukraine  ] would have to pay [ORG RUE  ] 12 billion cubic meters ( bcm ) of gas to settle the debt . 
This could be done by transferring [MISC Ukrainian  ] gas already in storage to [ORG RUE  ] , bringing [MISC RUE’s  ] reserves in storage in [LOC Ukraine  ] up to 23.5 bcm , since [ORG RUE  ] already has 11.5 bcm in storage ( Ukraine’s maximum storage capacity is 34 bcm ) . 
The gas would normally be exported to [LOC Europe  ] at market prices , which despite falling world gas prices would still be very profitable . 
[PER Firtash  ] hinted that if [ORG RUE  ] was removed with [MISC Russian  ] approval , [LOC Ukraine  ] would most likely attempt to take or steal all of [MISC RUE’s  ] gas in storage . 
Ties to [MISC Russian  ] Organized Crime ------------------------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( S ) The Ambassador asked [PER Firtash  ] to address his alleged ties to [MISC Russian  ] organized crime bosses like [PER Semyon Mogilievich  ] . 
[PER Firtash  ] answered that many Westerners do not understand what [LOC Ukraine  ] was like after the break up of the [LOC Soviet Union  ] , adding that when a government cannot rule effectively , the country is ruled by “the laws of the streets.” He noted that it was impossible to approach a government official for any reason without also meeting with an organized crime member at the same time . 
[PER Firtash  ] acknowledged that he needed , and received , permission from [PER Mogilievich  ] when he established various businesses , but he denied any close relationship to him. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( S ) Firtash’s bottom line was that he did not deny having links to those associated with organized crime . 
Instead , he argued that he was forced into dealing with organized crime members including [PER Mogilevich  ] or he would never have been able to build a business . 
If he needed a permit from the government , for example , he would invariably need permission from the appropriate “businessman” who worked with the government official who issued that particular permit . 
He also claimed that although he knows several businessmen who are linked to organized crime , including members of the [ORG Solntsevo Brotherhood  ] , he was not implicated in their alleged illegal dealings . 
He maintained that the era of the “law of the street” had passed and businesses could now be run legitimately in [LOC Ukraine  ] . 
He underscored the importance of unifying [LOC Ukraine  ] politically in order to reduce the influence of [MISC Russian  ] organized crime bosses on [MISC Ukrainian  ] businesses .
