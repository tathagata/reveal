( C ) Summary . 
[MISC German  ] authorities in [LOC Frankfurt  ] arrested close [PER Kagame  ] confidant and Chief of [MISC Rwandan Presidential Protocol  ] , [PER Rose Kabuye  ] , under a [MISC European  ] arrest warrant , based on indictments issued by a [MISC French  ] judge in 2006 . 
[PER Kabuye  ] requested transfer to [LOC France  ] , where she will answer charges that she participated in the shooting down of the [PER Habyarimana  ] presidential jet in 1994 , an event which touched off the genocide . 
[ORG GOR  ] officials will continue to assert that the case represents an abuse of jurisdiction by a [MISC French  ] government unable to acknowledge its own failures and complicity in the genocide . 
[LOC Rwanda  ] 's efforts to cement its own economic future by doing such things as begin today a land title process for genocide survivors and perpetrators , or a novel power generation scheme for [LOC Lake Kivu  ] methane , continue to be shunted aside and undermined by ill-conceived actions such as this arrest . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Rose Kabuye  ] , Chief of Protocol at the [MISC Rwandan  ] Presidency and a highly-trusted member of President [PER Kagame  ] 's inner-most circle , was arrested in [LOC Germany  ] on November 9 while advancing a visit by President [PER Kagame  ] to the [LOC Frankfort  ] stock exchange . 
[PER Kabuye  ] had previously visited [LOC Germany  ] this year as part of an official [PER Kagame  ] visit , and had traveled with the immediate presidential traveling party to benefit rom the [MISC German  ] version of " entourage " immunity. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Kabuye  ] and eight others were accused in 2006 by [MISC French  ] terrorism Judge Bruguiere of having participated in the shooting down of President [PER Habyarimana  ] 's jet in April of 1994 , the event which touched off the genocide . 
Bruguiere 's indictment resulted in the issuance of [MISC European  ] arrest warrants . 
During the past two years , the [MISC British  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] , [MISC Belgian  ] and [MISC German  ] governments have issued [PER Kabuye  ] diplomatic and/or transit visas allowing her to advance [PER Kagame  ] 's trips or make connections in [MISC European  ] airports for onward travel to the [LOC U.S.  ] or elsewhere . 
The [MISC Rwandans  ] have largely rejected the [MISC Europeans'  ] ( specifically the [MISC French  ] ) contention that they can do little to influence the judicial process to have the indictments overturned . 
In turn , the [ORG GOR  ] response has been to assert the speciousness of the Bruguiere indictments within the [ORG African Union  ] and elsewhere . 
The [ORG GOR  ] has sought to quash the indictments in [MISC French  ] courts . 
The [ORG GOR  ] claims that [MISC European  ] governments are furthering the agendas of various [ORG Hutu Power  ] organizations such as the [ORG Democratic Force  ] for the [ORG Liberation of Rwanda  ] ( [ORG FDLR  ] ) , the rump genocidal armed group ensconced in eastern [LOC Congo  ] by these indictments , and by their failure to arrest and extradite to [LOC Rwanda  ] genocide suspects. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) These indictments have weighed heavily on the [ORG GOR  ] , as have the February 2008 [MISC Spanish  ] indictments on genocide and other charges of an additional 40 senior [MISC Rwandans  ] ( some also are on the [MISC French  ] list ) . 
The [ORG GOR  ] asserts these two sets of indictments are inappropriate usages of universal jurisdiction ( jurisdiction not based on links of territoriality or nationality as to the crime , suspect or victim ) , arguing that only international bodies such as the [ORG International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda  ] ( [ORG ICTR  ] ) or the [ORG International Criminal Court  ] ( [ORG ICC  ] ) should hear such cases . 
[ORG International Criminal Court  ] ( [ORG ICC  ] ) should hear such cases . 
The [MISC French  ] indictments concern the death of the [MISC French  ] air crew on [MISC Rwandan  ] soil , while the [MISC Spanish  ] indictments concern in part the death of [MISC Spanish  ] citizens in [LOC Rwanda  ] and the [LOC Congo  ] -- neither case is a pure expression of universal jurisdiction. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Rose Kabuye  ] , herself a war hero in the effort by the [ORG Rwanda Patriotic Army  ] ( [ORG RPA  ] ) to stop the genocide and defeat the [ORG Hutu Power  ] rump government , has also expressed to embassy contacts her weariness with the [MISC French  ] indictments . 
Following her return from [MISC UNGA-related  ] travel in October , she confided - after the [MISC Dutch  ] Embassy cautioned her not to transit [LOC Amsterdam  ] en route to the [LOC U.S.  ] - it would be better just to travel to [LOC France  ] to fight the indictment and have the case heard . 
According to another highly-placed source in the Presidency , [PER Kagame  ] has himself expressed his fatigue with the burden of working to achieve the entry into various capitals of indicted officials when official [ORG GOR  ] visits are planned and had suggested to [PER Kabuye  ] that other protocol officers begin to gain greater experience in organizing his travel . 
In comments both to the press and the DCM on November 9 , Information Minister [PER Louise Mushikiwabo  ] said in some ways the arrest was a " blessing in disguise " as the truth would finally be known . 
[PER Kabuye  ] has waived any right to contest her detention in [LOC Germany  ] , opting instead to be transferred immediately to [LOC France  ] where she and at least two others on the Bruguiere indictments already have legal counsel . 
As this is written , a large crowd , several thousand strong , peacefully gathered in front of the [MISC German  ] embassy to voice its ( government-organized ) concern at the arrest of [LOC Kabuye.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment . 
The timing of [PER Kabuye  ] , s arrest , while seemingly unconnected to other events , comes after [MISC German  ] courts last week released two genocide suspects previously detained upon request by [MISC Rwandan  ] authorities , including [ORG FDLR  ] Secretary General [PER Callixte Mbarushimana  ] , who was picked up while traveling to [LOC Germany  ] from [LOC France  ] to visit [ORG FDLR  ] President [PER Ignace Murwanashyaka  ] . 
Also last week , ten [MISC French  ] citizens accused of complicity in the 1994 genocide in the [ORG Mucyo Commission  ] report ( ref A ) filed a libel suit against the [PER Kagame  ] government . 
In both instances , these legal issues are taking place against the backdrop of increased international attention , including on the part of the [MISC French  ] government , to try to resolve the deteriorating situation in eastern [LOC Congo  ] . 
[PER Kabuye  ] , s arrest and the release of the two genocide suspects in [LOC Germany  ] will reinforce [MISC Rwandan  ] suspicions that [MISC European  ] governments are not serious about addressing what they underscore is the fundamental problem in the [LOC Great Lakes  ] region -- namely the ongoing presence of the genocidal forces in eastern [LOC Congo.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Moreover , the [ORG GOR  ] has aggressively asserted the unfairness of the two sets of indictments as well as the right of its officials to travel to [ORG EU  ] nations without restriction on what it regards as official business . 
A reported warning of the [MISC German  ] government in this particular case went unheeded , perhaps purposefully so . 
Both the [MISC French  ] government and the [ORG GOR  ] may now get what they purport to want -- a full hearing on the merits of the alleged participation ( of at least one [ORG RPA  ] suspect ) in the 1994 shootdown of the [PER Habyarimana  ] plane . 
The [ORG GOR  ] will likely express considerable unhappiness with a [MISC French  ] court hearing this case , and criticize the [MISC French  ] government for continuing to deny its own failures and complicity in the genocide . 
[PER Kabuye  ] 's reputation as a fearless fighter will only be enhanced by her apparent willingness to subject herself immediately to the [MISC French  ] courts . 
Today , [LOC Rwanda  ] began to issue its first land titles to farmers in an area with both former genocidaires and survivors . 
Last week , as violence spiked in [LOC North Kivu  ] , [LOC Rwanda  ] began generating electricity with a pilot plant using methane gas from [LOC Lake Kivu  ] . 
In both events , government ministers decried the continued failure of the regional and international community to " turn the page . 
" End comment. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) Text of [ORG GOR  ] press release follows: [PER Begin Text:  ] Kigali November 9 , 2008 The Government of [LOC Rwanda  ] wishes to inform the public that the Director General of the [ORG State Protocol  ] , Mrs. [PER Rose Kabuye  ] was arrested in [LOC Germany  ] today November 9 , 2008 while on official business . 
The arrest was effected in connection with a warrant put forth in 2006 by Judge [PER Jean-Louis Bruguiere  ] of warrant put forth in 2006 by Judge [PER Jean-Louis Bruguiere  ] of [LOC France  ] for her alleged implication in a 1994 plane crash which killed [LOC Rwanda  ] 's then-president [PER Juvenal Habyarimana  ] . 
Mrs. [PER Kabuye  ] appeared in court earlier today , where the judge offered her the option to contest the warrant in [LOC Germany  ] or face it in [LOC France  ] , she chose the latter . 
Mrs. [PER Kabuye  ] was not surprised by the arrest ; among other warnings , attempts to stop her last trip to [LOC Germany  ] in April this year and just a few days ago through official communications from [LOC Germany  ] . 
Mrs. [PER Kabuye  ] is innocent , which is why she undertook the trip despite warnings , and ultimately why she is ready to face trial in [LOC France  ] . 
The Government of [LOC Rwanda  ] believes that this is a political game designed to blur the truth and weaken the Government . 
The arrests warrants have been contested in courts in [LOC Belgium  ] , [LOC France  ] , The [ORG Hague  ] ; and they were condemned by all Heads of [ORG State of the African Union  ] . 
The Government of [LOC Rwanda  ] therefore continues to be disappointed that mass murders of the 1994 genocide continue to enjoy freedom and protection in [MISC European  ] capitals , including [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC France  ] even as they pursue their extermination plans on [MISC European  ] soil . 
The Government of [LOC Rwanda  ] , once again , strongly condemns the judicial bullying it , s been subjected to by [MISC European  ] judges and the perversion of the principle of universal jurisdiction by some powerful nations .
