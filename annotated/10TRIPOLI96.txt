End summary . 
2 . 
( C ) On January 27 , the Ambassador ( accompanied by ISN/CTR [PER Katherine Insley  ] , P/E chief and econoff ) met with Dr. [PER Ali Gashut  ] , [ORG Head of the Libyan Atomic Energy Establishment  ] , who was accompanied by his deputy , Dr. [PER Mohamed Ennami  ] , to discuss bilateral engagement on scientist redirection programs and the establishment of a [ORG Regional Nuclear Medicine Center  ] . 
At the outset , [PER Gashut  ] , the Embassy 's primary point of contact on scientist engagement activities , said the [MISC Libyans  ] were not happy with the lack of progress on the regional [ORG Nuclear Medicine Center  ] ( [ORG NMC  ] ) , a project that he and his staff had been working on for the last five years . 
However , he sensed that the Ambassador and the [ORG USG  ] were acting in goodwill to move the project forward and characterized the [ORG NMC  ] as the " fruit of the good work we have been doing together for the last five years , " beginning with the signing of the " [MISC Sister Lab  ] " agreement in 2006 . 
[PER Gashut  ] stated that in working together " as one team , " we can overcome the problem of funding that was standing in the way of progress , and pledged , " We will find a way to help you come up with the money necessary to begin to implement the project . 
" 3 . 
( C ) The Ambassador told [PER Gashut  ] that in order for the [ORG USG  ] to authorize the [ORG USG-funded Architecture and Engineering  ] ( [ORG A&E  ] ) design work to begin , a letter from the [MISC Libyan  ] side was necessary , outlining [LOC Libya  ] 's commitment to work in partnership on the [ORG NMC  ] and quantifying the [MISC Libyan  ] contributions to the project . 
He said that the letter [PER Gashut  ] sent to ISN/CTR in December 2009 , which reiterated [LOC Libya  ] 's expectation that the [LOC U.S.  ] would fully fund the [ORG NMC  ] as a " reward " for [LOC Libya  ] 's decision to give ups its WMD program had been unhelpful and only served to stall progress on the project . 
[PER Gashut  ] said he understood the [LOC U.S.  ] position and indicated that the language was included for " political " reasons. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>Â¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Referring to his meeting the previous day with ISN/CTR visiting officials ( septel ) , [PER Gashut  ] recognized ISN 's funding limitations and indicated [LOC Libya  ] would agree to a cost-sharing approach , which took into account the monetary value of the contributions that [LOC Libya  ] had already made to the project . 
[PER Gashut  ] said that " It 's always been understood that we have a part to play ; we want to show the [MISC Libyan  ] people and the international community that we have benefited from this WMD decision by completing this program . 
" He agreed to provide a letter reiterating [LOC Libya  ] 's commitment to work in partnership with the [LOC United States  ] to build the [ORG NMC  ] and to quantify in that letter the in-kind contributions that [LOC Libya  ] had already invested in the project , such as the costs of land , staff salaries , office space and the conversion of lab facilities for [ORG NMC  ] functions . 
[PER Gashut  ] noted that the [ORG GOL  ] had designated 1.5 hectares of land ( approximately 5 acres ) in a prime location , close to the [ORG Tripoli International Airport  ] , for the [ORG NMC  ] site . 
5 . 
( C ) [PER Gashut  ] characterized the [MISC Libyan  ] side as " extremely energetic " about completing the project , stating that " everyone in the Cabinet , [ORG MFA  ] and government " were committed to moving forward on the [ORG NMC  ] in partnership with the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Gashut  ] emphasized that the [MISC Libyan  ] leadership was very focused on the [ORG NMC  ] . 
He said that , " The [ORG MFA  ] sees this project as an opportunity to open new doors of cooperation . 
The Cabinet feels this project will show real intent and will on the [MISC U.S.-side  ] to move forward with cooperation . 
" The [ORG NMC  ] would also serve as a model for other countries , which were still hesitant about giving up their WMD programs . 
It would be a convincing tool to promote nuclear nonproliferation and the spread of civilian nuclear programs . 
[ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000096 002.2 OF 002 6 . 
( C ) In [PER Gashut  ] 's view , some progress on building the [ORG NMC  ] -- such as beginning [ORG A&E  ] design work -- will make a huge , positive impact on the bilateral relationship and will change for the better the approach that [MISC Libyan  ] leadership has had toward us . 
He noted that many government officials were arguing for deeper engagement with the [LOC U.S.  ] , and they wanted the [ORG NMC  ] project to be a foundation for their argument to win out over the views of the skeptics: " In [LOC Libya  ] at least 4,000 people have graduated from [LOC U.S.  ] universities , and many of them are in influential positions . 
This is a big plus for bilateral relations . 
" 7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The Ambassador reaffirmed the [LOC U.S.  ] desire to increase engagement in all areas of the bilateral relationship , including moving forward on the [ORG NMC  ] project . 
Acknowledging that we have had problems over the last year that set back the relationship -- including the [ORG GOL  ] 's unexpected delay on shipment of [LOC Libya  ] 's highly enriched uranium spent nuclear fuel , in which [PER Gashut  ] had been involved -- the Ambassador expressed his intention to devote the second year of his tenure developing stronger relationships with [MISC Libyan  ] leadership , so that when crises arise , both sides could work together to move past them . 
He listed the current freeze on visas for official [LOC U.S.  ] travelers among the crises that we were currently facing , which must be resolved in order to put the bilateral relationship back on a steady path . 
By contrast , the Ambassador highlighted the positive momentum of the [ORG NMC  ] project , which offered an opportunity to jumpstart the normalization process with [LOC Libya  ] . 
8 . 
( C ) In addition to the [ORG NMC  ] project , [PER Gashut  ] expressed [ORG GOL  ] interest in signing a bilateral cooperative agreement on the peaceful applications of nuclear energy . 
He reviewed two approaches the [MISC Libyans  ] had made to the [ORG USG  ] on this proposal , first in 2008 prior to the visit of then-Secretary of State [PER Condoleezza Rice  ] , and then during [ORG National Security Advisor Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi 's April 2009 visit to [LOC Washington  ] , when the [MISC Libyan  ] Embassy submitted a draft agreement to the Department . 
[PER Gashut  ] said that [LOC Libya  ] sought [LOC U.S.  ] support for its plans to build the first nuclear power plant in the country: " We need your assistance so that both sides can benefit from these developments . 
" 9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Comment: Post  ] sees great value in moving ahead quickly on the [ORG Nuclear Medicine Center  ] project . 
Senior [MISC Libyan  ] officials -- including [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Musa Kusa  ] -- have repeatedly raised the issue , hinting that the perceived lack of progress has threatened continued normalization of the bilateral relationship . 
From the [MISC Libyans'  ] perspective , progress on the project -- including new [ORG USG  ] funding arrangements that go beyond the initial [ORG A&E  ] design phase -- would be a tangible sign of the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to bilateral engagement that could help jumpstart the relationship after several months of crisis . 
The [ORG GOL  ] will not give [PER Gashut  ] 's team the funds to pay for construction of the [ORG NMC  ] . 
We strongly urge the Department to explore alternative [ORG USG  ] funding sources to support those construction costs .
