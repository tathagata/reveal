( [ORG S  ] ) At a meeting within the [ORG GIRoA  ] with [PER COS Daudzai  ] , [PER D/Amb  ] . 
Ricciardone asked for [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] outlook on the anti-coalition [ORG Jundullah  ] organization ( Septel ) , and Karzai’s and Daudzai’s assessments of [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] interests with [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Daudzai  ] confirmed February 2 , that only he and President [PER Karzai  ] had any substantial political engagement with the [MISC Iranian  ] government . 
[PER Karzai  ] does pay close attention to [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Daudzai  ] said , and he suggested that [PER Karzai  ] could help “open a door” for the [LOC United States  ] to engage [LOC Iran  ] “perhaps after [PER Ahmadinejad  ] leaves the scene , ” or at any time the [ORG USG  ] may judge useful . 
He explained that [PER Karzai  ] had maintained excellent relations with [LOC Iran  ] and [ORG Khatami  ] personally , and that [PER Karzai  ] had obtained the former [MISC Iranian  ] president’s support for Daudzai’s appointment as [MISC Afghan  ] Ambassador to [LOC Tehran  ] . 
Relations had become more complicated with [MISC Ahmadinejad’s  ] election . 
[PER Daudzai  ] went on to serve about a year and a half in [LOC Tehran  ] , from 2004-2005. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER D/Amb  ] . 
Ricciardone posited that , while President [PER Obama  ] and Secretary [PER Clinton  ] had made clear the [LOC United States’  ] willingness to discuss our differences with the [MISC Iranians  ] , [LOC Iran  ] evidently is not ready to engage with us . 
Even though we believe that many [MISC Iranians  ] desire more normal relations with the [LOC United States  ] , the [MISC Iranian  ] government appears out of touch with its people , in particular an increasingly angry middle class. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Daudzai  ] related that after the first and only time he was “summoned to the MFA” for a complaint on alleged [ORG GIRoA  ] support for [ORG Jundullah  ] ( Septel ) , and his categorical denial later proved true , he developed excellent relations with [MISC Iranian  ] officials . 
Nonetheless , living in [LOC Tehran  ] had been “challenging” . 
At first , [MISC Iranian  ] intelligence shadowed Daudzai’s every move ; after he told the [MISC Iranians  ] that he was annoyed that he was being followed , the [MISC Iranians  ] became more subtle in their approach . 
He was astonished that while there were no [MISC Sunni  ] mosques in [LOC Tehran  ] , an estimated 30 to 40 percent of its population was [MISC Sunni  ] ( combining [MISC Iranian  ] and [MISC Afghan  ] Sunnis residing there ) . 
He established an informal mosque in the basement of the [MISC Afghan  ] Embassy , an act that drew much appreciation from the [MISC Sunni  ] population. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - [MISC Iranian  ] People [PER Dislike Foreigners  ] , Except [MISC Americans  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Reflecting on his time in [LOC Tehran  ] , [PER Daudzai  ] said he had reached two main conclusions: 1 ) “Common” [MISC Iranians  ] hate foreigners , except for [MISC Americans  ] , whom they “miss” . 
To illustrate , he said that even his wife’s doctor told her , “Please tell the [MISC Americans  ] to bring their soldiers to our country next.” 2 ) paradoxically , the [MISC Iranian  ] revolution lives on its animosity towards the [LOC United States  ] . 
If this animosity ends , then the revolution will end . 
The national leadership knows this and thus do all they can to sustain “the revolution.” While [PER Daudzai  ] did not foresee that the [MISC Iranian  ] revolution would end under [MISC Ahmadinejad’s  ] tenure , he predicted that [MISC Ahmadinejad’s  ] influence over the remainder of his term would wane . 
Therefore , he said , it was opportune to now start “preparing the ground” for [LOC U.S.  ] relations with [LOC Iran  ] under a better leader who would replace [PER Ahmadinejad  ] even though the Supreme Leader really “calls the shots.” [PER Daudzai  ] said that [MISC Iran’s  ] “real” Foreign Minister is not [PER Motaki  ] , but rather [PER Ali Akbar Velayati  ] , who reports to the Supreme Leader. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - The Two Sides of [MISC Iranian  ] Influence in [LOC Afghanistan  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Daudzai  ] said [MISC Iran’s  ] influence in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , like [LOC KABUL  ] 00000436 002.2 OF 002 Pakistan’s , has been both helpful and hurtful . 
( Last year , [PER Daudzai  ] had acknowledged that [LOC Iran  ] paid limited amounts of money to the Palace only episodically and unpredictably . 
He contrasted this with sustained [LOC U.S.  ] financial support to [LOC Afghanistan  ] with far more than the [LOC Iranians’  ] occasional cash payment . 
) [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] each had supported their own favored [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Mujahedin  ] groups against the [MISC Soviets  ] , largely along religious affiliations . 
Likewise , in the current conflict , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] , and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] were each supporting their “preferred” [ORG Taliban  ] groups . 
This time , however , [MISC Iran’s  ] support was driven by “a war of objectives” not religious sympathies: [LOC Iran  ] would even support [MISC Sunni  ] [ORG Taliban  ] to counter [MISC Western  ] influence in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , so long as the [ORG Taliban  ] factions they supported were not affiliated with [PER Mullah Omar.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Daudzai  ] said that two years ago when he raised with the [MISC Iranians  ] their support for [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Taliban  ] , they had flatly denied any involvement . 
However , over the past half year , the [MISC Iranians  ] , including their Ambassador in [LOC Kabul  ] , no longer deny this assertion -- now they remain silent , he said . 
[PER Daudzai  ] attributed the [MISC Iranian  ] change in posture to their awareness that the [ORG GIRoA  ] has evidence of [MISC Iranian  ] support for some [ORG Taliban  ] elements. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Daudzai  ] said that on occasion , young [MISC Afghan  ] males are allowed to cross into [LOC Iran  ] , where they are recruited and trained before returning to [LOC Afghanistan  ] to fight against the [ORG GIRoA  ] and [ORG Coalition Forces  ] . 
The [MISC Iranians  ] also recruit [MISC Afghan  ] university students and graduates . 
[PER Daudzai  ] said that approximately 7,000 [MISC Afghans  ] hold [MISC Iranian  ] university degrees , including three of President Karzai’s cabinet picks , who “fortunately” Parliament did not confirm . 
He claimed that [LOC Iran  ] is also offering three-year visas to [MISC Afghans  ] who deposit USD 100,000 in an [MISC Iranian  ] bank account. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) According to [PER Daudzai  ] , [LOC Iran  ] grooms thousands of [MISC Afghan  ] religious scholars . 
After completing their education in [LOC Iran  ] , they return to [LOC Afghanistan  ] to work in [LOC Madrassas  ] , where they continue to receive “support packages” from [LOC Iran  ] . 
The support package included a monthly salary . 
[PER Daudzai  ] claimed that a man named [PER Ibrahim  ] directed this program from the Supreme Leader’s office . 
He also asserted that in addition to financing [MISC Afghan  ] religious leaders , [LOC Iran  ] had provided salary support for some [ORG GIRoA  ] deputy ministers and other officials , including “one or two even in the [PER Palace.” Daudzai  ] claimed that some of these officials had been relieved of their duties because “you can’t be an honest [MISC Afghan  ] if you receive a ( [LOC Iran  ] ) package.” - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - [MISC U.S.-Iranian Convergence of Interests  ] is Complicated - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Daudzai  ] opined that there could be room for indirect , but not direct , cooperation between [LOC Iran  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] regarding [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[LOC Iran  ] at best would “tolerate” the [LOC U.S.  ] participation in an area of common interest here , he said . 
He would reflect further on the subject and would look forward to continuing the conversation .
