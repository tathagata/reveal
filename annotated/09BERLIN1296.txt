( C//NF ) [MISC Summary: A  ] well-placed [ORG Free Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) source told [PER Emboffs October  ] 15 that Chancellor [PER Angela Merkel  ] aims to finish coalition negotiations between her [ORG Christian Democratic Union  ] , the [ORG Christian Social Union  ] , and the [ORG FDP  ] by October 18 , but that the [ORG FDP  ] viewed a completion of October 23 to be more feasible . 
Either date would allow the parties to hold conventions to approve the agreement during the following days and enable the [MISC Bundestag  ] to elect [PER Angela Merkel Chancellor  ] on October 28 , one day after the first scheduled meeting of the new [MISC Bundestag  ] . 
[ORG FDP  ] source said that in any case , the virtually certain future Foreign Minister [PER Guido Westerwelle  ] would want to do the [PER Chancellor  ] " the favor " of ensuring her election before her upcoming visit to [LOC Washington  ] on November 2 . 
A worst case scenario -- and least likely -- is that she would be elected by November 8 , source said , just prior to the November 9 fall of the [LOC Wall anniversary  ] . 
Source provided [PER Emboffs  ] with a list of the 15 mostly domestic-oriented points included in the [ORG FDP  ] campaign platform that it wants to see included in the coalition agreement , including withdrawal of the remaining non-strategic nuclear weapons from [MISC German  ] soil , the only one addressing foreign policy ( reftel ) . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C//NF ) Source provided [PER Emboffs  ] with a schedule of the next days of the coalition negotiations . 
The schedule showed that the various working groups of the negotiations would each report to the plenary ( see reftel ) October 16-17 , with a smaller group of the plenary then meeting on October 17 to iron out disputed issues and beginning discussions on division of the ministerial portfolios between the parties . 
[PER Chancellor Merkel  ] , source said , hopes to wrap up the coalition negotiations on October 18 after a full-day plenary session , a goal he described as " very ambitious but possible . 
" Source noted that the [ORG FDP  ] was not as optimistic that a conclusion could be reached as of October 18 , and scheduled three more plenary sessions for October 21 , 22 and <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
He noted that it is feasible that a coalition agreement could be concluded by that date and that the three parties would then hold conventions to approve the agreement in the days following. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C//NF ) This schedule would enable the [MISC Bundestag  ] to then elect [PER Merkel  ] as Chancellor October 28 , the day after its first plenary . 
Source noted , however , that the [ORG FDP  ] has alerted the party of three possible party convention dates: October 25 -- if things go as plans , November 1 -- if negotiations are prolonged , or November 8 -- worst case scenario . 
Source said that it would not be " unattractive " for [PER Westerwelle  ] to attend the [ORG EU  ] Summit October 29-30 . 
This would be a good " debut " for [PER Westerwelle  ] , he added . 
In the event negotiations are prolonged , source said that [PER Westerwelle  ] would like to do the Chancellor " the favor " by enabling her to be elected Chancellor before she travels to [LOC Washington  ] November 2. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C//NF ) About the actual negotiations , [ORG FDP  ] source provided [PER Emboffs  ] with 15 points from their election platform that the [ORG FDP  ] would like to see included in the coalition agreement . 
The majority of the 15 points focus on domestic economic and social issues , including structural tax reform , amendments to the social welfare and pension systems , and support for education . 
The points also include the goal of ending what is termed " unnecessary and ineffective " measures to censor the internet and preventing domestic military deployments . 
The final point , and the only one that concerns foreign policy , calls for " entering negotiations with our allies " in order to achieve a withdrawal of nuclear weapons stationed in [LOC Germany  ] during the next legislative term . 
( Note: In response to Emboff questions , source said that the goal really is to develop a plan for the withdrawal of the nuclear weapons . 
End note . 
) [ORG FDP  ] source said that conscription is a disputed issue that is still under discussion . 
Regarding [LOC Turkey  ] 's [ORG EU  ] membership , [ORG FDP  ] source said that the [ORG FDP  ] would rather not include anything on this subject in the agreement , arguing that it will not be at issue during the next four years. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C//NF ) [ORG FDP  ] source assessed that about 85 percent of the issues will be decided during this coming weekend . 
The [ORG FDP  ] intends to keep the remaining 15 percent of the issues open and use them as bargaining tools for decisions on the division of ministerial portfolios . 
Regarding portfolios , [ORG FDP  ] source commented off the record that current Interior Minister [PER Wolfgang Schaeuble  ] had been trying to serve as the [ORG CDU  ] 's " grey eminence , " seeking to exert influence over many of the working groups , beyond his own working group of internal security . 
Source said that the [ORG FDP  ] viewed his role negatively , and that he was referred to within the [ORG FDP  ] as " an angry old man . 
" He indicated that he hoped the [ORG CDU  ] would also view his role as counterproductive . 
Source , however , noted that the agreement will only state which ministerial portfolios each party will receive , without providing any names . 
He stressed that it is up to each party to then decide who will fill those positions .
