( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] The prosecution in the [MISC Khodorkovskiy/Lebedev  ] trial has finished reading its 188 volumes of evidence , and has moved on to questioning witnesses . 
An observer for the [ORG International Bar Association  ] stated his belief that the trial is being conducted fairly . 
Related events outside of [LOC Russia  ] continue to affect the case . 
A deposition in a [LOC U.S.  ] court by [ORG Price Waterhouse Coopers  ] ( [ORG PWC  ] ) may show that [ORG PWC  ] received [ORG GOR  ] pressure to disavow its prior [ORG Yukos  ] audits ; the [MISC Russian Supreme Court  ] upheld an [ORG ECHR  ] ruling that [PER Lebedev  ] 's initial arrest was illegal ; and an arbitration court in the [LOC Hague  ] found [LOC Russia  ] to be bound by the [ORG Energy Charter Treaty  ] , leaving it open to a large judgment against it and possible seizure of [ORG GOR  ] assets abroad by [ORG Yukos  ] shareholders . 
Despite the case 's wide implications , it continues to be a cause celebre only for foreigners and a minority of [MISC Russians  ] . 
The case also shows the great lengths that the [ORG GOR  ] is willing to go in order to place a " rule of law " gloss on a politically motivated trial . 
End Summary . 
Recent developments ------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The trial of former [ORG Yukos  ] chief [PER Mikhail Khodorkovskiy  ] and his associate [PER Platon Lebedev  ] continues in [LOC Moscow  ] 's Khaminovsky court , having moved from the reading of the prosecution 's evidence -- which comprised 188 volumes and lasted throughout the summer -- to questioning of the prosecution 's witnesses . 
Thus far the prosecution has called 31 of its 250 witnesses , meaning that the trial will probably last until 2012 . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us December 23 that he believes the trial is being conducted fairly and that Judge Danilkin has been doing everything in his power to make sure that the defense gets a fair opportunity to present arguments and challenge the prosecution 's evidence. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Among recent developments in the case , the defense has been trying to introduce the testimony of a former [ORG Price Waterhouse Coopers  ] ( [ORG PWC  ] ) auditor , who was deposed in [LOC California  ] in August by [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] lawyers . 
The prosecution has objected to the introduction of the deposition into the case , complaining that they had not received sufficient notice ; however , according to [PER Teets  ] , the [MISC Russian  ] Embassy did not inform the head investigator in [LOC Russia  ] until recently . 
The [ORG PWC  ] deposition goes to the heart of [ORG Yukos  ] 's guilt or innocence ; as [ORG Yukos  ] 's auditor , it signed off on [ORG Yukos  ] 's financial statements from 1994 to 2003 , only to disavow this prior approval in 2007 . 
As [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted , if the audits were properly withdrawn , this will be a " black mark " for the defense ; if not , it could help the defense , but would greatly tarnish [ORG PWC  ] 's international reputation . 
[PER Teets  ] said that the content of the deposition had not yet been made public , but speculated that the auditor had testified that [ORG PWC  ] had been pressured by the [MISC Russian  ] government into withdrawing its prior certifications of [ORG Yukos  ] books and records . 
[PER Lebedev  ] ruling and other " international " issues --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Yukos  ] battle continues simultaneously both on domestic and the international fronts , with some concrete effects on the case 's proceedings in [LOC Moscow  ] . 
On December 23 , the [MISC Russian Supreme Court  ] ruled that the 2003 decision to arrest and detain [PER Lebedev  ] was illegal , in keeping with a 2007 ruling by the [ORG European Court of Human Rights  ] ( [ORG ECHR  ] ) . 
( [MISC Note:  ] The [ORG GOR  ] often loses cases at the [ORG ECHR  ] , and its common practice is to pay the compensation required by the [ORG ECHR  ] 's rulings while ignoring the substantive redress of the systemic problem involved . 
This decision represents a rare departure from this practice and signals a potentially encouraging trend . 
End Note . 
) The [ORG Supreme Court  ] 's ruling indicated only that the first two months of [PER Lebedev  ] 's six years ( to date ) of incarceration were illegal , and thus might be considered only marginally relevant . 
However , the defense might use this ruling to argue that the entire conviction was tainted by the illegal detention and therefore should be thrown out . 
Defense lawyers told [ORG Radio Free Europe  ] that they have not yet decided how to proceed , but called the ruling a " victory , " while expressing bewilderment at the [ORG Supreme Court  ] 's two-year delay in ruling on the case. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On December 23 , [LOC Moscow  ] 's [ORG Basmanny Court  ] issued an arrest warrant in absentia for former [ORG Yukos  ] treasurer [PER Andrey Leonovich  ] , which [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] 's lawyers called a ploy to pressure witnesses , and which will likely further exacerbate tensions with the [LOC UK  ] ( where [PER Leonovich  ] now resides ) over the issue of extraditions . 
This move follows a December 2 ruling by an international arbitration tribunal in the [LOC Hague  ] that [LOC Russia  ] is bound by the [ORG Energy Charter Treaty  ] ( [ORG ECT  ] ) , thus requiring the [ORG GOR  ] to defend itself against claims from [ORG Yukos  ] shareholders for an estimated 100 billion USD in damages ( ref A ) . 
This sum would be the largest arbitration award ever , representing 10 percent of [LOC Russia  ] 's GDP , and although collecting the entire amount would be difficult , it could allow shareholders to seize state assets outside of [LOC Russia  ] . 
The [ORG ECT  ] ruling could affect , among others , companies such as [ORG Royal Dutch Shell  ] and [ORG BP  ] who were forced to renegotiate contracts on terms favorable to the [ORG GOR  ] . 
[MISC Russians  ] apathetic , but skeptical towards [ORG GOR  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Given such significant international implications to the case , and given [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] 's former stature , one might expect a large amount of focus on the [ORG Yukos  ] case inside [LOC Russia  ] . 
However , most [MISC Russians  ] continue to pay scant attention ( ref B ) . 
According to a December poll by the [ORG Levada Center  ] encompassing 1,600 respondents in 127 cities and villages , only a little more than one-third of [MISC Russians  ] are following the case ( a May [ORG Levada  ] poll showed the same figure for people who were at all aware that the case existed ) . 
The same poll , however , revealed a notable divergence in public opinion from the " party line " maintained by Prime Minister [PER Vladimir Putin  ] . 
In his December 3 televised question and answer session with the public , [PER Putin  ] defended the legitimacy of [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] 's incarceration and accused [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] of also being a murderer . 
He also claimed that all of the earnings from the sale of [ORG Yukos  ] were being funneled into the country 's Housing and [ORG Utilities Fund  ] . 
The [ORG Levada  ] poll , however , showed that 65 percent of respondents did not believe [PER Putin  ] 's claim about the [ORG Housing Fund  ] , and 50 percent believed that [PER Putin  ] should be summoned as a witness in the case . 
[PER Khodorkovskiy  ] starting to lose hope ----------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] and [PER Lebedev  ] have consistently maintained an upbeat demeanor , frequently smiling and laughing during the proceedings , and chatting buoyantly with supporters . 
Over the course of his imprisonment , [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] has written a series of philosophical articles ( printed in liberal papers such as [ORG Vedomosti  ] ) that have amounted to shadow policy papers of the type that he might write if he were one of the President 's advisors . 
He had also expressed faith that the [MISC Russian  ] court system would exhibit sufficient fairness and rule of law , and Judge Danilkin sufficient independence , to acquit him . 
In recent months [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] has made pessimistic statements that he does not expect ever to be freed . 
By all accounts , in 2003 [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] did not believe he would actually be arrested . 
His thinking here seems to following a similar trajectory , from naive refusal to believe what is happening , to the gradual sinking in of the reality of his situation . 
Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The fact that legal procedures are apparently being meticulously followed in a case whose motivation is clearly political may appear paradoxical . 
It shows the effort that the [ORG GOR  ] is willing to expend in order to save face , in this case by applying a superficial rule-of-law gloss to a cynical system where political enemies are eliminated with impunity . 
It is not lost on either elite or mainstream [MISC Russians  ] that the [ORG GOR  ] has applied a double standard to the illegal activities of 1990s oligarchs ; if it were otherwise , virtually every other oligarch would be on trial alongside [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] and [PER Lebedev  ] . 
There is a widespread understanding that [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] violated the tacit rules of the game: if you keep out of politics , you can line your pockets as much as you desire . 
Most [MISC Russians  ] believe the [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] trial is politically motivated ; they simply do not care that it is . 
Human rights activists in general have an uphill battle in overcoming public apathy and cynicism , but nowhere more so than in the [PER Khodorkovskiy  ] case . 
We will continue to monitor the case as it unfolds .
