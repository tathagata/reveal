( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: Your December 7-8 visit to [LOC London  ] comes after Prime Minister [PER Gordon Brown  ] has finished putting his own stamp on the government , following this summer’s transition from [PER Tony Blair’s  ] tenure , and begins focusing on governing . 
It also comes at a time during which major infrastructure programs such as [ORG Heathrow Terminal  ] 5 are nearing completion and new proposals such as [LOC London  ] [ORG Crossrail  ] and a new runway for [LOC Heathrow  ] are being launched . 
[PER Ruth Kelly  ] , Secretary of State for Transport , has highlighted security , liberalization , and environmental protection as key priorities . 
Kelly’s tenure began two days before terrorists drove a car with crude explosives into the [LOC Glasgow  ] airport terminal , and security remains a key transport concern in the [LOC UK  ] . 
End Summary . 
( [LOC U  ] ) [ORG UK Political Scene  ] ---------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) After leading the [ORG Labour Party  ] for 13 years and Her [ORG Majesty’s Government  ] for ten years , [PER Tony Blair  ] stepped down in June and [PER Gordon Brown  ] succeeded him as Prime Minister . 
[PER Brown  ] had served as Chancellor of the Exchequer ( finance minister ) throughout [PER Blair’s  ] premiership and had always been the obvious choice to succeed him . 
It was [PER Brown  ] who ran the economy ; the New [ORG Labour  ] program that made the [ORG Labour Party  ] electable again after 18 years in opposition was as much his creation as [PER Blair’s  ] . 
[PER Brown  ] got off to a strong start over the summer . 
The public welcomed his solid competence as a refreshing change after [PER Blair’s  ] perceived slickness , and hoped he would turn the page on the deeply unpopular [LOC Iraq  ] war . 
The new PM responded well to several early crises: abortive terrorist attacks in [LOC London  ] and [LOC Glasgow  ] ; the worst flooding in 60 years ; and an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease . 
Brown’s unexpected lead in the opinion polls fueled disunity within the main opposition [ORG Conservative Party  ] and prompted speculation that he would call a snap election this fall ( though he need not do so until May 2010 ) . 
The prospect of a fourth consecutive general-election trouncing caused the [MISC Conservatives  ] ( “Tories” ) to rally behind their leader [PER David Cameron  ] , who delivered a stellar speech to the annual party conference ; the [MISC Tories  ] got a bounce in the polls , and the Prime Minister decided not to call an election after all . 
That decision was widely seen as a humiliating climb-down , and his claim that the polls had nothing to do with the decision damaged his reputation for integrity . 
Ever since then , the bad news has just kept on piling up for Brown: - the [ORG Labour Party General  ] Secretary abruptly resigned after it emerged that a major donor was using proxies to conceal his contributions to the party and the General Secretary knew about it and failed to comply with legal requirements ; - a government agency lost personal data - including bank account details - on 25 million people ( out of 60 million ) when a junior employee violated security regulations all too easily . 
Another case emerged recently in which a government contractor kept personal data for a year after finishing its project , leading to serious questions of the government’s handling of data ; - the government’s loan guarantees in response to the mortgage bank [ORG Northern Rock  ] crisis ( [MISC Britain’s  ] first run on a bank since 1866 ) put over [ORG BPS  ] 20 million ( equivalent to more than USD 40 million ) of taxpayers’ money at risk ; and - ministers and civil servants alike are said to be demoralized by Brown’s secretive and controlling approach , and parliamentary backbenchers despair at his vulnerability to [MISC Cameron’s  ] agile taunting . 
Key Bilateral Issues -------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) The [LOC UK  ] is our closest and most important ally . 
PM [PER Brown  ] is much less outgoing than [PER Blair  ] and wishes to avoid being accused - as [PER Blair  ] was - of being President [PER Bush’s “poodle  ] , ” but he wants - and knows that [LOC Britain  ] needs - a strong relationship with the [ORG U.S. Administration  ] . 
He considers [LOC Afghanistan  ] the primary front in the military conflict against [MISC Islamist  ] terrorism and is increasing the UK’s involvement there , while emphasizing that the global threat of violent [MISC Islamist  ] extremism cannot be defeated by military means . 
On [LOC Iraq  ] , he is reducing the [MISC British  ] presence while insisting that the [LOC UK  ] will meet its obligations to the [MISC Iraqi  ] people and the international community . 
He attaches great importance to resolving the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] conflict and is keen to support economic development in the [MISC Palestinian  ] territories . 
All [MISC British  ] nationals detained at [LOC Guantanamo  ] have been returned to the [LOC UK  ] , and [ORG HMG  ] has requested the return of five detainees who have residency ties here ; bilateral discussions are ongoing . 
Surface Transportation Programs ------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In 2003 , the Mayor of [LOC London  ] introduced a congestion charge of [ORG BPS  ] 5 ( USD 10 ) per day to drive into the central portion of [LOC London  ] ( 50 pence per day for those living inside the zone ) . 
The city considers this a fee for service ( improved transportation infrastructure , decreased pollution and congestion ) , and did not grant a diplomatic exemption . 
After determining that the fee was actually a tax , and therefore not payable under the [LOC Vienna  ] Conventions of Diplomatic and [ORG Consular Affairs  ] , the [ORG Department of State  ] engaged in lengthy negotiations with the [ORG Foreign and Commonwealth Office  ] and the [LOC City of  ] [LOC London  ] . 
In July 2005 , after negotiations concluded unsuccessfully , the [ORG Department instructed the Mission  ] and its members to stop paying the tax . 
The [ORG U.S. Embassy  ] was not the first to refuse to pay , and following the expansion of the congestion zone and increase in the fee to [ORG BPS  ] 8 ( USD 16 ) in 2007 , a large number of missions , including 23 of the 27 [ORG European Union  ] missions in [LOC London  ] , now refuse to pay the tax . 
[LOC London  ] Mayor [PER Ken Livingstone  ] has focused his ire publicly against the [ORG U.S. Embassy  ] and the Ambassador personally . 
His position , however , should be seen in the wider context of his anti-American positions on many issues and his coziness to the likes of [PER Hugo Chavez  ] and [PER Fidel Castro.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC U  ] ) In October , PM [PER Brown  ] gave the go-ahead to a major light rail program for [LOC London  ] that was first raised in the 1980s . 
[PER Crossrail  ] will be a new east-west railway linking [LOC Maidenhead  ] and [LOC Heathrow  ] in the west with [LOC Shenfield  ] and [PER Abbey Wood  ] in the east via tunnels under [ORG Central London  ] . 
The track will be 118 kilometers and will house 38 new stations , enabling an estimated 200 million passenger journeys a year . 
Construction is set to begin in 2010 with the first trains expected to run in 2017 . 
PM [PER Brown  ] said [PER Crossrail  ] will be of “enormous importance , not just for [LOC London  ] but for the whole country” and would generate up to 30,000 new jobs . 
Funding , projected to be [ORG BPS  ] 16bn ( USD 32bn ) , will be met by the government , businesses and farepayers , with a [ORG BPS  ] 5bn ( USD 10bn ) grant coming from the [ORG Department for Transport  ] . 
Direct contributions will be made by some of the project’s key beneficiaries , including the [LOC City of  ] [ORG London Corporation  ] . 
TfL estimates that [PER Crossrail  ] will contribute [ORG BPS  ] 30bn ( USD 60bn ) to the [LOC UK  ] economy . 
Getting approval for this project is seen as a major accomplishment for [PER Ruth Kelly  ] and her department. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC U  ] ) In 2004 the government announced the creation of the [ORG Transport Innovation Fund  ] ( [ORG TIF  ] ) , designed to support the costs of smarter , innovative local transport packages . 
Projects address demand management , congestion charging , and local and regional schemes to benefit national productivity . 
In 2005 , [ORG Cambridgeshire  ] successfully bid for [ORG BPS  ] 385,000 ( USD 770,000 ) and was awarded a further [ORG BPS  ] 1.055m ( USD 2.11m ) to fund a study looking at transport packages that combine demand management measures with measures to encourage modal shift . 
The funding was provided on the condition that the local authority study whether a congestion charge would be appropriate in [LOC Cambridge  ] . 
In October 2007 [LOC Cambridge  ] submitted another bid for nearly [ORG BPS  ] 500m ( USD 1bn ) which would be used to fund large-scale improvements to public transport , highways and cycling facilities and demand management measures , specifically congestion charging . 
The government is also considering a bid from [LOC Manchester  ] which would involve [ORG BPS  ] 3bn ( USD 6bn ) worth of public transport improvements in exchange for a peak-hour congestion charge of up to [ORG BPS  ] 5 ( USD 10 ) a day. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC U  ] ) On November 14 , the first high-speed [ORG Eurostar  ] train left the modernized [LOC St. Pancras  ] station for [LOC Paris  ] . 
The move to [LOC St. Pancras  ] , on the north side of [ORG Central London  ] , from [LOC Waterloo  ] , on the south side , will make it easier for passengers from [LOC Northern England  ] and [LOC Scotland  ] to connect to the Continent . 
The move is the culmination of a [ORG BPS  ] 5.8bn ( USD 11.6bn ) 10-year project designed to speed up travel to [LOC Britain  ] from [LOC France  ] and [LOC Belgium  ] . 
The new 68-mile high speed single rail line between [LOC St. Pancras  ] and the tunnel under the [LOC English Channel  ] is the final section of high speed rail to be completed and enables [ORG Eurostar  ] trains to hit 190mph . 
It cuts journey times by approximately 20 minutes and links [LOC London  ] with [LOC Paris  ] in two hours , 15 minutes and [LOC London  ] with [LOC Brussels  ] in one hour , 51 minutes . 
( [LOC U  ] ) [LOC London  ] [MISC Olympics  ] ------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [LOC U  ] ) [LOC London  ] will host the Summer [MISC Olympic Games  ] in 2012 . 
Transportation for the [MISC Games  ] will be delivered through a partnership between the [ORG Olympic Delivery Authority  ] ( [ORG ODA  ] ) [ORG Transport  ] team , Transport for [LOC London  ] ( TfL ) , [ORG Department for Transport  ] ( DfT ) , [ORG Network Rail  ] and other transport providers . 
The [ORG ODA  ] aims for 100 percent of ticketed spectators to travel to the [MISC Games  ] by public transport , walking or cycling . 
There will be no private car parking for spectators except for some “Blue Badge” disabled parking . 
An [ORG Olympic Route Network  ] ( [ORG ORN  ] ) will be implemented for the transportation of athletes , comprising a network of roads linking competition and key non-competition venues . 
In general , roads will remain open to the public . 
However , some traffic lanes will be dedicated for [MISC Games  ] vehicles on the busiest sections of the route . 
An [ORG Olympic Transport Operations Center  ] ( [ORG OTOC  ] ) will be established to manage all modes of transport . 
Airport Infrastructure and [ORG Aviation Liberalization  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [LOC U  ] ) The [LOC UK  ] remains the destination for the highest number of passengers departing the [LOC U.S.  ] by air , and [LOC Heathrow  ] airport processes more international passengers than any other airport in the world . 
In the face of continued rapid aviation growth rates , airport infrastructure is a key concern in the [LOC UK  ] . 
Creaking and groaning under the weight of old infrastructure coupled with modern security requirements , [LOC Heathrow  ] operator [ORG BAA  ] and the flying public will welcome the opening of Terminal 5 , on March 27 , 2008 . 
This new terminal , which is on time and under budget , will nearly double existing capacity , and is capable of handling the [MISC Airbus A-380.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [LOC U  ] ) While there is light at the end of the passenger capacity tunnel , [LOC Heathrow  ] is unique among airports of its size in operating only two runways . 
In fact , the southeast of [LOC England  ] has not seen a new runway since the Second [MISC World War  ] , and the government is eager to see a new runway at [LOC Heathrow  ] , [LOC Stansted  ] , or both . 
Nor is the issue limited to [LOC England  ] , as Scotland’s [LOC Prestwick  ] airport is the busiest single runway airport in the world . 
On November 22 , the [ORG Department for Transport  ] published a consultation on adding a third runway at [LOC Heathrow  ] airport by 2020 . 
This has kicked off a lively public debate , with positions crossing party lines . 
As may be expected , noise and local air quality issues dominate the environmental debate around the third runway , although climate change concerns figure prominently as well . 
In addition , the new runway would require the demolition of an entire village just north of the airport. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) [ORG BAA  ] ( formerly , [ORG British Airports Authority  ] , which was privatized in 1984 ) has also come under considerable criticism for its levels of service and the [ORG Parliament’s Transport Select Committee  ] has launched hearings on the issue . 
In addition , the [ORG Competition Commission  ] has recently investigated whether [MISC BAA’s  ] dominance of the [LOC London  ] area should be allowed to continue . 
Finally , the [ORG Civil Aviation Authority  ] has just published on November 20 its proposal for fee structures at [LOC Heathrow  ] and [LOC Gatwick  ] ( along with [LOC Stansted  ] , fees for these airports are regulated by the [ORG CAA  ] because of [MISC BAA’s  ] near monopoly over [LOC London  ] ) , which neither airlines nor [ORG BAA  ] find acceptable . 
On the whole , airport issues will remain a major topic for [PER Ruth Kelly  ] for the remainder of her tenure. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( SBU ) Sentiment in the [LOC UK  ] regarding the conclusion of the first phase of the [ORG U.S.-EU Air Services Agreement  ] was largely negative , and [PER Ruth Kelly  ] and other ministers are under considerable pressure to conclude successfully a second round of negotiations , including concessions on foreign ownership of [LOC U.S.  ] airlines . 
Airlines such as Virgin and [ORG BA  ] are eager to gain access to the [LOC U.S.  ] market , as you are well aware . 
Public opinion also plays a role , as the agreement was seen by many as another example of [LOC UK  ] interests being subsumed by negotiators in [LOC Brussels  ] . 
[ORG Department for Transport  ] officials have raised the desire for a timely and successful conclusion of a second phase on numerous occasions , and have not been deterred by explanations of the [LOC U.S.  ] political climate - especially during an election year . 
Secretary [PER Kelly  ] may raise this issue with you . 
SIPDIS UK-U.S . 
Climate Change Differences ---------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( SBU ) The predominant environmental concern in the [LOC UK  ] is climate change . 
The [LOC UK  ] was disappointed the [LOC U.S.  ] did not sign the [ORG Kyoto Protocol  ] . 
Local air quality is a concern , but when faced with a trade-off , [LOC UK  ] policy will tend to favor reducing carbon output ( as evidenced by the fact that around 50% of vehicles in the [LOC UK  ] run on diesel and would not meet most [LOC U.S.  ] air quality standards ) . 
There is strong support for action on climate change legislation across the political spectrum and among the general public in the [LOC UK  ] . 
The [LOC UK  ] participates in the [MISC EU Emissions  ] Trading Scheme ( [ORG ETS  ] ) , a cap-and-trade program to help [LOC Europe  ] meet its [ORG Kyoto Protocol  ] commitments on carbon emissions . 
The [LOC UK  ] is also a key supporter of a [ORG European Commission  ] proposal to include aviation in the second phase of [ORG ETS  ] , which is working its way through the legislative process . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and other governments have registered concerns over the legality of this unilateral environmental regulation on aviation emissions , which should be resolved within the [ORG International Civil Aviation Organization  ] . 
Secretary Kelly’s office has indicated that she will raise this issue with you. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( SBU ) Transportation is one of the largest and fastest growing contributors to climate change in the [LOC UK  ] , and aviation is seen as unique in that it is not subject to fuel tax and duty ( with the sole exception of non-commercial general aviation ) . 
In an attempt to be seen to address the growth in aviation emissions and make aviation pay its environmental costs , Her [PER Majesty’s Treasury  ] ( [ORG HMT  ] ) recently mooted a proposal to abandon air passenger duty ( [ORG APD  ] ) in favor of a charge on every flight leaving the [LOC UK  ] . 
The proposal aims to include previously excluded categories such as cargo , transfer passengers , smaller aircraft and non-commercial aviation . 
The proposal still lacks detail , but the intent is to provide incentives to reduce emissions and more closely align the tax with environmental impact . 
[ORG HMT  ] has held several meetings with [LOC UK  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] and other passenger and cargo carriers . 
In addition , the [MISC Embassy  ] met recently with [ORG HMT  ] and DfT officials to seek more information , including HMG’s views on the compliance of the proposal with international obligations such as air services agreements and the [ORG Chicago Convention  ] . 
It is clear that [LOC UK  ] analysis is not yet well developed , but [ORG HMG  ] indicated a willingness to exchange further information and hold discussions with a view to avoiding another conflict over aviation and emissions . 
Transportation Security ----------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( U ) Transportation security remains high on Secretary Kelly’s agenda , as transportation security oversight remains within her department . 
On June 29 , just one day after [PER Kelly  ] assumed her duties as Transport Secretary , police discovered two failed car bombs in London’s [LOC West End  ] . 
The following day , terrorists drove a flaming vehicle equipped with a crude explosive device into a terminal at [LOC Glasgow  ] airport . 
This incident came less than a year after police foiled an attempt to smuggle liquid explosives aboard [MISC U.S.-bound  ] airlines and almost two years to the day after the July 7 [LOC London  ] bombings in which 52 commuters were killed on three Underground trains and a bus . 
[LOC UK  ] aviation suffered considerably after the liquid explosives attempt , with massive cancellations and delays . 
The long term effects of the liquid explosive attempt have been felt far and wide . 
However , in the [LOC UK  ] , the overstretched security infrastructure could not cope with the additional security requirements and passengers were strictly limited to one carry-on bag . 
Secretary [PER Kelly  ] has announced that this restriction will be lifted next year . 
This move , along with additional measures , i.e. , implementation of new technologies such as ct scans at checkpoints at [LOC Heathrow  ] and [LOC Gatwick  ] , should improve passenger flow . 
[MISC U.S.-UK  ] transportation security and counter-terrorism cooperation is very strong . 
We are encouraging [LOC UK  ] security officials to focus on soft targets countermeasures , counter radicalization and intelligence sharing .
