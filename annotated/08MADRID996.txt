( C ) Poloff conveyed concerns per reftel and asked that [LOC Spain  ] consider speaking out against [MISC Nicaraguan  ] President [PER Ortega  ] 's September 2 decision to recognize the independence of [LOC South Ossetia  ] and [LOC Abkhazia  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] MFA Sub-Director General for [LOC Mexico  ] , [ORG Central America  ] and [LOC The Caribbean  ] [PER Jorge Romeu  ] told poloff September 16 that although he and his colleagues had discussed [PER Ortega  ] 's announcement during coordination meetings , his impression was that [LOC Spain  ] would not be proactive in addressing it . 
Overall , [PER Romeu  ] was skeptical of the positive outcome of demarching the [LOC GON  ] , saying he knew the response would reference [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
Reacting subsequently to if raised points regarding [LOC Kosovo  ] , he noted [LOC Russia  ] might say the same , that its recognition of the two republics was a " special case " that should not be viewed as a precedent , either . 
He added that the comparisons did not affect [LOC Spain  ] anyway , because the [ORG GOS  ] has yet to recognize [ORG Kosovo.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Romeu  ] deferred to the expertise of his colleagues who cover [ORG Eastern Europe  ] and suggested the [MISC Spanish  ] were more likely to act within the [ORG EU  ] framework than bilaterally . 
He described a [MISC Danish  ] proposal to carry out a demarche expressing the [ORG EU  ] 's " surprise " and " regret , " and said he sympathized with the reluctance on the part of [ORG EU  ] partners to speak out in those terms . 
Saying some within the [ORG EU  ] had suggested ending cooperation with [LOC Nicaragua  ] altogether over this and other of [PER Ortega  ] 's actions , [PER Romeu  ] cautioned that [LOC Spain  ] -- at the level of the Director General for Foreign Policy -- would only consider demarching [LOC Nicaragua  ] in an " appropriate context , " reshaping terms and perhaps considering an " explanatory demarche " rather than a derogatory one . 
After all , [PER Romeu  ] said , [PER Ortega  ] is " a mad man .
