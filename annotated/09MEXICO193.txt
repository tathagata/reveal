Reason: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) ------- Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) 2008 set a new record for organized crime-related homicides with more than 6000 killings . 
Violence in [LOC Mexico  ] suddenly provided fodder for [LOC U.S.  ] and international media with commentators suggesting worse to come . 
While the death toll is already at disturbing levels , and there are no signs violence will taper off anytime soon , we will continue to evaluate information or evidence that would suggest the cartels have decided to up the ante significantly by undertaking mass-casualty attacks on civilians , systematically attacking [ORG GOM  ] officials or institutions or targeting USG personnel . 
Internecine struggles among the cartels and [ORG GOM  ] counter narcotic successes have increased the costs of doing business and account for most of the up-tick last year . 
Frustrated traffickers , seeking to diversify profit-making activities through kidnappings and extortion , account for more . 
End Summary. ---------------------------------- Drug-Related Homicides on the Rise ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Few killings in [LOC Mexico  ] are thoroughly investigated , and determining which are truly related to organized crime remains an inexact science , but [LOC Mexico  ] 's Attorney General 's office 's year-end estimate stands at 6262 . 
Other [ORG GOM  ] authorities put the toll from organized crime slightly higher . 
SEDENA reports that drug-related killings represented roughly 17% of all homicides last year , while the [ORG National System of Public Security  ] ( [ORG SNSP  ] -- part of the [ORG Public Security Secretariat  ] ( [ORG SSP  ] ) ) estimates a total of approximately 10,700 intentional homicides . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [ORG Table I: Organized Crime-Related Killings  ] , By [MISC Year*  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------- 2005 1855 2006 2489 2007 3038 2008 6380 ---------------------------------------- *Source: SEDENA ( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [ORG Table  ] II: 2008 OC-Related Killings , By Month* --------------------------------------------- ----- Jan 282 Feb 283 Mar 417 Apr 320 May 496 Jun 531 Jul 540 Aug 587 Sep 526 Oct 847 Nov 843 Dec 708 --------------------------------------------- ------ *Source: SEDENA -------------------------------------------- Spike in Violence Concentrated at the Border -------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Violence continued to be concentrated in a few key states , and in 2008 there was a spike in drug-related killings in the northern border territories . 
An estimated 41 percent of these homicides took place in [LOC Chihuahua  ] and [LOC Baja California  ] states and largely in two urban areas , [LOC Ciudad Juarez  ] and [LOC Tijuana  ] . 
( see [LOC MEXICO  ] 3586 ) . 
[ORG Sinaloa  ] continued to rank among the most violent states with approximately 1048 ( or 18% ) of these killings . 
The surge in violence along the border stems largely from the intensified struggle among cartels over a few lucrative land crossings to the [LOC U.S.  ] In particular , the January 2008 arrest of cartel leader [PER Alfredo Beltran Leyva  ] sparked a serious rift among the [LOC Gulf  ] , [LOC Juarez  ] and [ORG Sinaloa  ] ( [LOC Pacific  ] ) cartels , which is being played out viciously in [ORG Ciudad Juarez  ] . 
( See [LOC MEXICO  ] 1766 ) In [LOC Tijuana  ] , rival factions of the weakened [ORG Arellano Felix Organization  ] , one of which is backed by the [ORG Sinaloa  ] cartel , are battling for control. -------------------------- Changes In [MISC Cartel Behavior  ] -------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Beyond its broadened scope , the nature of cartel violence changed in 2008: organized violence was characterized by significantly increased brutality , a callous disregard for the potential for collateral damage and more frequent targeting of soldiers and police . 
[LOC Mexico  ] 's drug trafficking organizations ( DTOs ) have also more frequently orchestrated violence to send intimidating messages to security forces , the [MISC Mexican  ] public and the body politic. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Incidents , such as the August beheadings of 12 in [LOC Yucatan  ] , the execution style killing of 24 on the outskirts of [LOC Mexico City  ] in September , late fall killings of soldiers in [LOC Monterrey  ] and [LOC Guerrero  ] in late December contributed to growing public unease here and garnered media attention abroad . 
Several first-time-ever incidents involving grenades and improvised explosive devices ( such as the notorious [MISC Independence Day  ] grenade attack in [LOC Morelia  ] , the shooting and undetonated grenade attack on the [LOC US  ] Consulate in [LOC Monterrey  ] , the use of improvised explosive devices in downtown [LOC Mexico City  ] and [ORG Sinaloa  ] , and a grenade attack on police cadets in [LOC Jalisco  ] ) demonstrate that not only have the cartels successfully expanded their arsenals , but at least some elements have developed a tolerance for inflicting civilian casualties. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Cartels have also expanded their use of violence to intimidate . 
Beheadings and the prominent placement of dismembered bodies in public places , relatively rare two years ago are now common throughout the country . 
The late night grenade/shooting attack on our consulate in [LOC Monterrey  ] was obviously designed to send a message , although no individual or group has ever claimed responsibility . 
More explicit was the January assault on the [LOC Monterrey  ] offices of [ORG Televisa  ] , accompanied by a message telling the broadcaster to do a better job reporting on corrupt public officials . 
Attacks such as these remain sporadic so far , and we have insufficient indications whether they mark a new trend or not. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Despite these sporadic attacks , [LOC Mexico  ] 's drug war continues to primarily impact security forces and those linked directly or indirectly to the drug trade . 
The civilian population in some urban areas along the border remains bunkered down with some of those who have the money either sending their children to school in the [LOC U.S.  ] or relocating entirely to minimize risk . 
In much of the rest of the country , though , the civilian population not involved in the drug trade remains essentially insulated from the violence , though not from its effects. --------------------------------------------- -------- Police Killings Increase Along With Overall Death Toll --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) SEDENA estimates that at least 522 civilian law enforcement and military personnel were murdered last year , compared to 315 in 2007 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [ORG Table III: Drug-Related  ] [ORG Military/Police Homicides:  ] 2007* 2008** ( % of total ) [ORG AFI  ] 22 ( 6.9 ) 5 ( 1.0 ) [ORG PFP  ] 12 ( 3.8 ) 37 ( 19.7 ) [ORG State Police  ] 62 ( 19.8 ) 110 ( 21.1 ) [ORG Ministerial Police  ] 63 ( 20.0 ) 14 ( 2.7 ) [ORG Municipal Police  ] 120 ( 38.0 ) 305 ( 58.4 ) Military 27 ( 8.6 ) 51 ( 9.8 ) Other 9 ( 2.9 ) Unavailable --------------------------------------------- ------------- Total 315 522 CENAPI ( [LOC Mexico  ] 's [ORG Center for Information , Analysis and Planning  ] ) statistics **SEDENA statistics <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Increased confrontations between security forces and criminals is one explanation for the increasing killing of security forces personnel . 
[ORG GOM  ] authorities argue that killings are no longer just score-settling among bad cops , but increasingly the consequence of the government 's aggressive fight against the cartels . 
Some analysts we have spoken to agree . 
However , they also note that with few exceptions the majority of deaths are not the result of direct confrontations . 
They argue that the crackdown on police corruption has put compromised police officials in the position of either being prosecuted or breaking their established agreements/arrangements with the cartels . 
Hence , some of those who presumably choose the latter course are being punished brutally . 
( See [LOC MEXICO  ] 2371 , 3498 ) <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) It is worth noting that police victims ( at all levels of government ) represented eight percent of all 2008 killings believed to be drug-related , a figure slightly lower than the percentage in 2007 . 
The vast majority of victims continue to be state and municipal law enforcement officers . 
Senior level , federal police killings were still rare occurrences in 2008 . 
The most high-profile death remains the May killing of [PER Edgar Millan Gomez  ] , the country 's highest-ranking federal police officer. -------------------------------------- Targeting of Soldiers An [LOC Ominous Sign  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) There have been notable incidents of horrific violence against soldiers , including a string of slayings of enlisted men in [LOC Monterrey  ] in October and the systematic decapitation of seven troops in [LOC Guerrero  ] ( see [LOC MEXICO  ] 3779 ) . 
The theory that those killed in [LOC Guerrero  ] were rogue soldiers involved in drug trafficking has been discounted , suggesting the cartels have begun to target soldiers to exact revenge for successes registered by the military and attempt to undermine the institution 's resolve . 
The [LOC Monterrey  ] and [LOC Guerrero  ] killings immediately followed successful military operations in the respective regions resulting in seizures and arrests . 
Whether such tactics will have a chilling effect remains to be seen . 
Sources tell us that while some soldiers are more fearful , many others are keen to strike back at the cartels with greater resolve . 
[ORG SEDENA  ] and [ORG SEMAR  ] have instructed regional commanders to implement force protection counter-measures to reduce the risk of future incidents. ---------------------------------------- [LOC U.S.  ] Personnel and [ORG Institutions Targets  ] ? ---------------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) We have observed a significant up-tick in threats , as well as incidents of surveillance , against [ORG USG  ] personnel and properties over the last three months . 
All threats are treated seriously and precautions taken ; fortunately , none has come to fruition. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) On October 12 , unknown persons fired gunshots and tossed an un-detonated grenade at the [LOC U.S.  ] Consulate in [LOC Monterrey  ] . 
The attack occurred after hours , no one was injured , and little damage occurred . 
No message was left and we have uncovered no useful intelligence regarding the authors or their motives . 
One unsubstantiated report cited a source claiming a senior [LOC Gulf  ] cartel leader ordered the attack . 
However , with little hard evidence , no attempt to claim credit and no follow on incident to date , the possibility remains that this was an isolated , possibly even impulsive , attack not likely undertaken at the behest of senior cartel leaders. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) While the cartels have not yet directly targeted [ORG USG  ] law enforcement or other personnel , they have shown little reticence about going after some of our most reliable partners in [MISC Mexican  ] law enforcement agencies . 
Ten close [ORG DEA  ] law enforcement liaison officers have been killed since 2007 , seven of whom were members of Special Vetted Units . 
Similarly , within the past two years 51 close [ORG FBI  ] contacts have been murdered . 
More than sixty of [LOC Mexico  ] 's best law enforcement officers in whom we have placed our trust and with whom we have collaborated on sensitive investigations , shared intelligence and in many cases trained and vetted have been murdered by the cartels . 
We do know from sources that cartel members have at least contemplated the possibility of doing harm to both our personnel and institutions , but we frankly don't know enough about how [ORG DTO  ] members think and operate to know what factors might trigger a decision to mount such an attack , but the potential threat is very real. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) We assess that the threat to [LOC U.S.  ] personnel could increase if the violence continues to escalate and more high-level government officials and political leaders are targeted . 
Also , a reaction may be triggered if traffickers perceive their losses are due to [LOC U.S.  ] support to the [ORG GOM  ] 's counter-narcotics efforts . 
We will continue to monitor potential threats to [LOC U.S.  ] personnel from organized criminal gangs and be alert to information that suggests drug traffickers increasingly see the [LOC U.S.  ] hand as responsible for their losses. --------------------- A Measure of Success ? --------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) While attributing last year 's significant spike in violence to its own successes marks an effort by the [PER Calderon  ] administration to put the best face possible on a grim situation , there is also considerable truth to the assertion . 
President [PER Calderon  ] 's counter-narcotics team has scored significant successes , particularly in the last 12 months . 
Record numbers of weapons and drugs have been seized , key members of drug cartels have been arrested and/or extradited , cartel sources inside government institutions have been arrested ) including a former Deputy Attorney General and the head of [ORG Interpol  ] in [LOC Mexico  ] . 
The [ORG GOM  ] has disrupted cartel operations in meaningful ways ; in year-end reports [ORG SEDENA  ] and [ORG SEMAR  ] reported that together they have reduced the maritime trafficking of illicit drugs by 65 percent and cut direct air transit of illegal drugs from [LOC Colombia  ] by 90 percent . 
According to collaborative sensitive reporting , the January 2008 arrest of [PER Alfredo Beltran Leyva  ] split the [LOC Pacific Cartel  ] , and accentuated antagonism between that [ORG DTO  ] and the [LOC Gulf  ] organization which caused the spike in violence in [LOC Chihuahua  ] , [LOC Sinaloa  ] , and [LOC Baja California  ] ( see also [LOC MEXICO  ] 1766 ) . 
In addition to these rifts , frustrated traffickers have turned to kidnappings and extortion to compensate for the loss in drug-trafficking revenue , expanding their reach and impacting a greater number of bystanders who have no involvement in [ORG DTO  ] activities . 
These kinds of impacts bring home to ordinary [MISC Mexicans  ] the nature of the struggle here. ------- Outlook ------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [MISC Mexican  ] authorities and law enforcement analysts predict that violence will likely get worse before it gets better . 
Recent truce rumors notwithstanding , there is currently no indication that the violence will soon abate ; CENAPI reports 280 killings for the first 20 days of January . 
The cartels have shown themselves to be remarkably innovative , vicious , and resilient when aggressively confronted . 
Given their powerful weaponry and deep penetration of the country 's security institutions , further attacks against security forces and government officials seem all but inevitable . 
However , while violence remains at unacceptably high levels here , we have no reason to believe at this point that it will escalate either quantitatively or qualitatively .
