( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: [ORG EU  ] Foreign Ministers ( FMs ) , meeting in [LOC Brussels  ] July 27 as the [ORG General Affairs  ] and [ORG External Relations Council  ] ( [ORG GAERC  ] ) , received an overview of [MISC Swedish  ] Presidency priorities for the next six months . 
The [ORG GAERC  ] adopted without discussion numerous decisions , to include [MISC U.S.-EU  ] negotiations on payment data ( " [MISC Swift  ] " ) , and adopting a [MISC Common Position  ] extending the scope of restrictive measures against the [LOC DPRK  ] in line with UNSCR 1874 . 
Discussions in the [ORG General Affairs Council  ] focused on the work program of the [MISC Swedish  ] Presidency , the [LOC Baltic Sea Strategy  ] , and [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG EU  ] membership application . 
While unanimously deciding to refer [LOC Iceland  ] 's membership application to the [ORG European Commission  ] for its opinion , the [ORG Council  ] reiterated its support for [LOC Western Balkan  ] [ORG EU  ] aspirants . 
The [ORG External Affairs Council  ] devoted its attention to the situation in [LOC Somalia  ] , [LOC Georgia  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , [MISC Afghanistan-Pakistan  ] , and the [MISC Western  ] [LOC Balkans  ] . 
The next [ORG GAERC  ] will be in September . 
The press confernc also confirmed diffs place in [LOC Europe  ] . 
" [PER Rehn  ] declined to commit on thQ timetable for the presentation of the CommisQion 's opinion , saying the [ORG Commission  ] " will ue the same methodology as for any other appliQant . 
" [PER Rehn  ] noted , however , that [LOC Iceland  ] is aQready a member of the [ORG European Economic Area  ] ( [ORG EEA  ] ) and [LOC Schengen  ] , implying that " the distance to the [ORG EU  ] " may therefore be shorter . 
[LOC Iceland  ] already completed 22 of 35 [ORG EU  ] accession negotiation chapters in order to become a member of the [ORG EEA  ] , [PER Rehn  ] acknowledged . 
To this , [MISC Swedish  ] FM [PER Bildt  ] added , " It took [LOC Sweden  ] a longer time to negotiate its membership in the [ORG EEA  ] than its membership in the [ORG EU  ] " <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Responding to pressure from some Ministers , the [ORG Council  ] also sent " a very clear message " to [LOC Albania  ] ( whose application is to be handled when the June election procedure has been completed ) and the other countries of the [MISC Western  ] [LOC Balkans  ] , reiterating the [ORG EU  ] 's full support for their " [MISC European  ] perspective.Rehn stressed , too , that the [ORG EU  ] must continue to focus on " the need to stabilize and integrate more Eastern [MISC European  ] countries . 
" [ORG External Affairs  ] ---------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Chaired by [MISC Swedish  ] FM [PER Bildt  ] , the [ORG External Affairs Council  ] discussed - and issued formal Conclusions related to - [LOC Somalia  ] , [LOC Georgia  ] , and [LOC Iran  ] . 
Following recommendations from [PER HR Solana  ] , Ministers decided to step up [ORG EU  ] engagement for promoting peace and development in [LOC Somalia  ] . 
Priority will [LOC BRUSSELS  ] 00001048 002 OF 003 reportedly be given to activities that produce quick yet sustainable results to promote peace and recovery for the [MISC Somali  ] people . 
Capacity building of public institutions will be of particular importance in this context , FM [PER Bildt  ] saying that " the [ORG EU  ] is looking for every step that could contribute to stability . 
" [ORG External Relations Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner  ] stressed the importance of incorporating " all groups " into any stabilization efforts and noted that pledges for [ORG UNISOM  ] in the amount of 60 million [MISC Euros  ] had been obtained at a recent pledging conference. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) High Representative [PER Javier Solana  ] welcomed [LOC Norway  ] 's participation in [MISC Operation Atalanta  ] , and added , " We are also continuing our mission on the ground . 
" [PER Solana  ] alluded to a mission " for training security forces in [LOC Somalia  ] " and how to cooperate with the [ORG African Union  ] mission there , adding that the formal mission will " clarify our agreement on how to cooperate . 
" On July 29 , the [MISC French  ] pol-mil counselor told [PER PolOff  ] that while [ORG Member States  ] had not yet agreed on a particular course of action to support the [MISC Somali  ] security sector , he expects the [ORG EU  ] to launch an SSR initiative of some kind . 
[LOC France  ] is still looking to &Europeanize8 future training efforts for [MISC Somali  ] security forces in [LOC Djibouti  ] , following the recently launched [MISC French  ] national effort . 
[LOC Paris  ] wants to make sure , however , that any [ORG EU  ] action along these lines is a truly shared effort , not one where [LOC France  ] takes on the bulk of the military and financial burden , as in [LOC Chad  ] . 
In addition to the announced [ORG EU  ] mission , contacts from the [MISC French  ] and [LOC UK  ] missions say they support [ORG EU  ] participation in the security sector assessment mission that begins August 12 , in which the [LOC U.S.  ] is participating , but that some [ORG Member States  ] , including the [MISC Swedish  ] Presidency , need assurance that the assessment mission ties in with [ORG UN  ] efforts. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Turning to [LOC Georgia  ] , the [ORG Council  ] decided to extend the mandate of the [ORG EU  ] 's [LOC Monitoring Mission  ] ( [ORG EUMM  ] ) for an additional 12 months ( until 12 September 2010 ) . 
The [ORG Council  ] adopted joint actions extending both the duration of [ORG EUMM  ] and the mandate of the [ORG EU  ] Special Representative ( [ORG EUSR  ] ) for the [ORG Crisis in Georgia  ] . 
Responding to a question about whether the [ORG Council  ] had had an initial debate about inviting non-EU members to participate in [ORG EUMM  ] , FM [PER Bildt  ] said that the emphasis of the day 's discussions had been to " convey a message of stability and continuity , " implying that the issue of third-country participation " was not really addressed . 
" <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) On [LOC Iran  ] , FM [PER Bildt  ] reported the Ministers had " a rather thorough discussion over lunch . 
" While expressing satisfaction that " we managed to get release of people working for the [LOC UK  ] Embassy , " [PER Bildt  ] also reported " deep concern " about the detention of [MISC French  ] citizen [PER Clothilde Reiss  ] . 
[PER Bildt  ] added , " We expect her immediate release , " and noted that Ministers had expressed deep concern about the human rights situation in the country . 
Concerning the upcoming inauguration of President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , [PER Bildt  ] said that the [ORG EU  ] lacked " a definitely clear picture of the ceremonies , but would make its views known on the human rights situation and [MISC French  ] citizen detained . 
" [MISC Swedish  ] Presidency contacts told [PER Poloff  ] on July 29 that a consensus view on [ORG EU  ] participation at the upcoming inauguration did not emerge because details surrounding the event remained unclear ( no formal invitations received to date ) and Ministers wanted to gauge [LOC Iran  ] 's response to requests that [PER Reiss  ] be freed from detention . 
[ORG External Affairs  ] - Other Issues ------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) Concerning [MISC Afghanistan-Pakistan  ] , FM [PER Bildt  ] reported that the [ORG EU  ] and [PER SRAP Holbrooke  ] had sent a very clear message to [MISC Afghan  ] authorities and candidates for the upcoming elections that they expect a credible election . 
[PER Bildt  ] said that the [ORG EU  ] was " preparing for an even more active role " and that the post-election period would be critical for the future development of [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) Concerning the ongoing name dispute between [LOC Macedonia  ] and [LOC Greece  ] and reports in the [MISC Greek  ] press that the [MISC Greek  ] FM had claimed that accession negotiations could only move forward once the dispute was settled , Enlargement Commissioner [PER Rehn  ] said that there was " still a realistic chance to find a solution to the name issue . 
" He added that the [MISC Niemetz-led  ] mediation efforts were moving ahead and stressed that the necessarily unanimous decision to open [LOC BRUSSELS  ] 00001048 003.2 OF 003 negotiations will depend on [LOC Macedonia  ] meeting eight benchmarks . 
Speaking to the [MISC Western  ] [LOC Balkans  ] more broadly , [PER Rehn  ] said that it would be a " busy fall , " especially since the [ORG Commission  ] recently recommended visa-free travel for three countries in the region . 
He expressed his belief that it should be possible to find solutions to bilateral issues ( referring specifically to the [MISC Slovenia-Croatia  ] dispute and [LOC Macedonia  ] name issues ) , adding , " We need to tackle the issues one by one . 
That requires patience and determination , but there is no other choice than that . 
" Other Business -------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) Following the test of nuclear device by the [LOC DPRK  ] in May , the [ORG Council  ] adopted a [MISC Common Position  ] extending the scope of restrictive measures against the [LOC DPRK  ] in line with UNSCR 1874 . 
Ministers also decided without discussion to allow negotiations with the [LOC U.S.  ] on payment data ( " [MISC Swift  ] " ) to begin . 
[ORG EU-Macedonia SAA Council  ] ------------------------ <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C/NF ) [ORG Well-placed Council  ] sources tell us the annual [ORG EU-Macedonia SAA Council  ] was tense . 
Last-minute procedural changes demanded by the [MISC Greek  ] Deputy FM nearly derailed discussions , and the [MISC Macedonian  ] delegation itself took a noticeably harder line . 
" On orders from [LOC Athens  ] , " the [MISC Greek  ] Deputy FM reportedly demanded that all name placards for [MISC Macedonian  ] representative contain " [MISC FYROM  ] " spelled out fully , not simply list the name and title of each representative . 
A number of [ORG Council  ] officials successfully impressed upon the [MISC Greek  ] Deputy FM that changing the placards was not possible given the imminent start of the meeting , and that such an action would undoubtedly result in the [MISC Macedonian  ] delegation walking out . 
For their part , the [MISC Macedonian  ] delegation reportedly insisted on a variety of editing changes to references to their country , [PER Milososki  ] reportedly telling a [ORG Council  ] official that the current references to [LOC Macedonia  ] in [LOC EU-internal  ] documents amounted to " ethnic cleansing . 
" Ultimately , it took FM [PER Bildt  ] 's personal involvement to get the [MISC Macedonians  ] to back down and allow for the issuance of a joint statement upon conclusion of the meeting . 
[ORG EU-Belarus Troika  ] ----------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Taking place on July 28 , the [ORG EU-Belarus Troika  ] revealed that while both sides recognize the need to develop relations , it also confirmed differences on their expectations from one another . 
Describing relations as being at " a crossroads , " [ORG External Relations  ] Commissioner [ORG Ferrero-Waldner  ] made it clear that the [ORG EU  ] was ready to reengage with [LOC Belarus  ] . 
Trade , energy and visa facilitation were discussed , the latter being of particular interest to [LOC Belarus  ] FM [PER Martynov  ] . 
Characterizing the discussions as " frank and open , " FM [PER Bildt  ] expressed hope in progress , but left [PER Martynov  ] with no doubt ( alluding to [LOC Georgia  ] 's breakaway provinces ) about " the importance we attach to the principle of territorial integrity . 
" Concerning the [ORG Eastern Partnership Initiative  ] , [PER Bildt  ] noted that its implementation was just in the " start-up phase .
