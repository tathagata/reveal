<code><pre>Thursday , 21 January 2010 , 15:58 C O N F I D E N T I A L [LOC VATICAN  ] 000013 SIPDIS DEPARTMENT FOR OES DREW NELSON , [PER RACHEL KASTENBERG  ] , KATE LARSEN EO 12958 DECL: 1/20/2035 TAGS KGHG , PGOV , PREL , [ORG CU  ] , [ORG VE  ] , [PER VT SUBJECT:  ] “GREEN” POPE SUPPORTS US PATH FORWARD FROM [LOC COPENHAGEN  ] REF: A. [PER A. STATE  ] 3080 [PER B. B.  ] 09 [LOC VATICAN  ] 132 CLASSIFIED BY: [PER Julieta Valls Noyes  ] , [ORG DCM  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: The [LOC Holy See  ] supports USG efforts to have countries associate themselves with the [LOC Copenhagen  ] Accord by the January 31 deadline ( ref . 
A ) , and will encourage them to do so . 
The Pope’s recent environmental messages offer [LOC Vatican  ] officials a strong platform to leverage the moral authority of the Church to combat climate change . 
While the [LOC Vatican  ] supports the inclusion of all countries in international environmental discussions and decision-making , it is not naove about the political motives behind [ORG Cuba’s  ] and Venezuela’s criticism of [LOC Copenhagen  ] . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On January 20 , [PER P/EOff  ] met with Dr. [PER Paolo Conversi  ] , the [MISC Vatican’s  ] point person on climate change at the [ORG Secretariat of State  ] , to deliver ref . 
A demarche . 
[PER Conversi  ] immediately expressed the Holy See’s genuine desire to see the [LOC Copenhagen  ] process move forward . 
He was aware of the January 31 deadline but did not know which countries had agreed formally to join the process . 
[PER Conversi  ] agreed to encourage other countries discreetly to associate themselves with the Accord , as opportunities arise . 
( [ORG Note: For  ] practical reasons , the [LOC Holy See  ] will not formally associate itself with the [LOC Copenhagen  ] Accord: [LOC Vatican City  ] State’s carbon footprint negligible . 
The [LOC Vatican  ] decision is consistent with its practice of not becoming a formal party to agreements if they require substantial technical expertise and reporting commitments ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Conversi  ] was pleased overall with the process leading to [LOC Copenhagen  ] and with the Conference itself . 
He said expectations were too high before the event . 
Regarding the group of dissenting countries , including [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Cuba  ] , [PER Conversi  ] said the [LOC Vatican  ] was sympathetic to their complaints about inclusion in decision-making but believed their criticism was largely politically motivated . 
Noting that Pope [PER Benedict  ] had firmly established his “green” reputation using his [ORG New Years’ Day Peace  ] message to highlight environmental protection ( ref . 
B ) , [PER Conversi  ] said he looked forward to further collaboration with the [LOC U.S.  ] prior to [LOC Bonn  ] and [LOC Mexico  ] City. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) In a separate meeting , Monsignior [PER James Reinert  ] , the environmental analyst at the [ORG Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace  ] ( a [LOC Vatican  ] think tank ) , confirmed to [PER P/EOff  ] that the profile of environmental issues in the [LOC Vatican  ] is at an all-time high . 
[ORG Secretariat of State  ] officers represented the [LOC Holy See  ] at environmental meetings now , where in the past his own office would have had the lead . 
( [ORG Note: Justice and Peace  ] will continue to produce analytical documents on environmental issues for bishops around the world , while the [ORG Secretariat  ] will have the lead on policy , particularly in multilateral fora . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment: Conversi’s offer to support the [LOC U.S.  ] , even if discreetly , is significant because the [LOC Vatican  ] is often reluctant to appear to compromise its independence and moral authority by associating itself with particular lobbying efforts . 
Even more important than the [MISC Vatican’s  ] lobbying assistance , however , is the influence the Pope’s guidance can have on public opinion in countries with large [MISC Catholic  ] majorities and beyond . 
End Comment .
