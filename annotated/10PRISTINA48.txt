Dell  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Phil - I know that you are seeing [PER Robert Cooper  ] on Tuesday , February 2 , among other things , to discuss [LOC Kosovo  ] and the strategy for northern [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
Integrating [LOC Kosovo  ] [MISC Serbs  ] into [LOC Kosovo  ] society and preserving the country 's territorial integrity is central to [LOC Kosovo  ] 's and the region 's long-term stability and has been a core [LOC U.S.  ] policy objective since 1999 . 
In November 2009 , we had a breakthrough that ended ten years of [MISC Belgrade-imposed  ] stalemate when thousands of [MISC Serbs  ] in southern [LOC Kosovo  ] took part in [LOC Kosovo  ] municipal elections . 
We want to replicate that success in the north and end the stalemate that has left [LOC Kosovo  ] 's future uncertain . 
That fundamentally is what the so-called northern strategy is about . 
We want to coax the population into greater cooperation with [LOC Pristina  ] , not to impose outcomes on them. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Currently , we have a growing , if still somewhat fragile , consensus within the international community in [LOC Pristina  ] that the time is right to end the years of drift on the north and to alter the dynamic of a hardening partition between the north and the rest of [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
In part , this is sparked by the new willingness among [LOC Kosovo  ] [MISC Serbs  ] to engage with [LOC Kosovo  ] institutions . 
It also stems from [LOC Belgrade  ] 's increasingly aggressive actions in the north ( e.g. , seizure of the [LOC Valac  ] electrical substation ; unilateral appointment of [MISC Serb  ] judges to illegal parallel courts ) that have underscored to representatives of the international community on the ground the risks of continuing to do nothing . 
For ten years , we told the Kosovars to trust us -- " let us handle the situation , and we will protect you " -- and now the government of independent [LOC Kosovo  ] is increasingly asking us when we are going to make good on that commitment . 
KFOR is drawing down ( in six months [ORG NATO  ] could take a decision to cut its forces in half ) . 
We need to take advantage of a unique opportunity that has crystallized and act now while we still have a KFOR presence capable of handling any contingency. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [LOC Belgrade  ] has reacted vehemently to the northern strategy . 
I think this intensity is rooted in the concern that any positive momentum in the north will undermine [LOC Belgrade  ] 's likely post-ICJ strategy: push to reopen status talks and formalize the emerging de facto partition of [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
Furthermore , [LOC Belgrade  ] has shrewdly judged that raising the specter of confrontation rattles our [ORG EU  ] partners and is an effective tactic for derailing the strategy altogether . 
[PER Cooper  ] will likely reflect this anxiety with you , but I do not sense that this concern is nearly as strong within the local [PER Quint  ] ( with the exception of [MISC Italian  ] Ambassador [PER Michael Giffoni  ] , who spent ten years on [PER Javier Solana  ] 's staff , where the [LOC Brussels  ] bureaucrats have long been anxious about taking any difficult decision on the north ) . 
With this in mind , I recommend that you stress three points with [PER Cooper  ] . 
First , the northern strategy is not radical . 
Much of it restates what the international community , in general , and the [ORG EU  ] , in particular , are already committed to doing . 
Second , it provides a vehicle for constructively channeling the [ORG GOK  ] 's ambitions for the north and takes advantage of Prime Minister [PER Hashim Thaci  ] 's readiness to offer inducements to northern [MISC Serbs  ] who engage with [LOC Kosovo  ] institutions . 
Third , we now have legitimate [MISC Serb  ] partners ( elected by fellow [MISC Serbs  ] ) who are ready to help us in the north . 
These are the elements of a soft approach , which is the northern strategy 's leading edge. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) We should expect [LOC Belgrade  ] to challenge all elements of the strategy and to misportray the strategy as hard and confrontational . 
[MISC Serbian  ] Ministry for [ORG Kosovo State Secretary  ] [PER Oliver Ivanovic  ] has already declared that [LOC Pristina  ] is promoting conflict . 
This is not the case . 
There is no interest here in conflict ( not among the [PER Quint  ] and the [ORG ICO  ] , nor within the [ORG GOK  ] ) , but the current situation is untenable and deteriorating . 
The aim is to stop the rot in the north and create the positive momentum there that we need to secure our long-term policy objectives: a secure and stable [LOC Kosovo  ] and a [LOC Serbia  ] focused on its [ORG EU  ] future , not old ambitions and grievances . 
We need to start the process now , and we should not allow [LOC Belgrade  ] to use threats of confrontation as a veto to block progress. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) You can tell [PER Cooper  ] that the northern strategy offers incremental , but fundamental , steps necessary to getting the north right . 
We know , however , that there will be difficult challenges that pose risks . 
For example , EULEX must get serious about rolling up organized crime networks in the north that feed the parallel structures and make the current situation unsustainable . 
The northern [MISC Serbs  ] are the first victims of these thugs , and there is a growing body of reports that they would welcome a change if EULEX can deliver it . 
We must , also , deal with the blatant theft of [LOC Kosovo  ] property that has allowed [LOC Serbia  ] to , in effect , seize the northern power grid in [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
Dealing with these issues will require hard choices and fortitude . 
Our message to [PER Cooper  ] should be that we want to coordinate and consult with [LOC Brussels  ] every step of the way . 
This process , after all , only works if [LOC Brussels  ] makes clear to [LOC Belgrade  ] that its [ORG EU  ] future depends on real cooperation on [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
In recent meetings with [PER Boris Tadic  ] , both [PER Angela Merkel  ] and [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] reportedly emphasized that [LOC Serbia  ] 's path to [LOC Brussels  ] runs , in part , through constructive relations with [LOC Pristina  ] . 
This is the perfect message . 
[LOC Brussels  ] needs to repeat it -- regularly . 
We , of course , are also ready to consult with [LOC Belgrade  ] , as well , and to offer them the opportunity to engage constructively . 
Where we part company with some within the [ORG EU  ] , however , is in not being willing to accept that we must have [LOC Belgrade  ] 's agreement before taking any steps. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) I need to emphasize the importance of this moment . 
Failure to act soon means losing northern [LOC Kosovo  ] and will re-open the [PER Pandora  ] 's Box of ethnic conflict that defined the 1990s . 
Fortunately , our [MISC European  ] partners increasingly recognize this . 
My [MISC British  ] colleague here confirms what [ORG Stu  ] has also heard -- that there is a greater degree of commitment and resolve in member capitals than may be the case in the [ORG Commission  ] and the Council officialdom in [LOC Brussels  ] . 
Even there , though , initial anxieties over the strategy appear to be easing as they look more carefully at the content and less at the rhetoric .
