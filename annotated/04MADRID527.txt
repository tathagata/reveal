Summary <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Polls one month before the March 14 [MISC Spanish  ] general election continue to point to victory for the [ORG Popular Party  ] and [ORG Aznar  ] 's successor as party leader , [PER Mariano Rajoy  ] . 
The [ORG PP  ] hopes not just for a plurality , but for an absolute majority . 
Were the [ORG PP  ] to fall far short of an absolute majority , coalition formation would prove troublesome . 
Most polling consistently shows the [ORG PP  ] hovering just short of the absolute majority threshold . 
Socialist leader [PER Rodriguez Zapatero  ] has sought to breathe new life into his campaign by exploiting the [MISC Iraq/WMD  ] controversy , criticizing [ORG Aznar  ] for joining the [LOC Iraq  ] coalition . 
Most analysts believe the [LOC Iraq  ] issue will not be a major factor unless [LOC Spain  ] 's 1300 troops in [LOC Iraq  ] suffer large casualties . 
One month before the election , the outlook is similar to when [PER Rajoy  ] became [ORG Aznar  ] 's successor last September: the perception in [LOC Spain  ] is that it is [PER Rajoy  ] 's race to lose . 
End Summary . 
[ORG Major Party Differences on Relations  ] with the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) On March 14 , Spaniards will go to the polls to select a new Parliament , which will , in turn , select a new Prime Minister , known in [LOC Spain  ] as " President of the Government . 
" Polling data and political commentary have , for the past six months , pointed to a plurality for the [ORG PP  ] , led by [ORG Aznar  ] 's successor as party leader , [PER Mariano Rajoy  ] . 
This trend continues . 
Most polls show the [ORG PP  ] leading by seven or eight points over the [ORG Socialists.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Rajoy  ] and Socialist ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) leader [PER Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero  ] offer distinct domestic and foreign policy choices to the [MISC Spanish  ] electorate . 
[PER Rajoy  ] has pledged to maintain [ORG Aznar  ] 's strong ties with the [LOC US  ] , including its close counter-terrorism cooperation and participation in the [LOC Iraq  ] coalition . 
He also promises to keep [LOC Spain  ] 's vigorous economy on track and preserve the integrity of the [MISC Spanish  ] state in the face of nationalist pressures in the [MISC Basque  ] and [LOC Catalunya  ] regions. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Zapatero  ] , in contrast , pledges to re-focus [LOC Spain  ] on [LOC Europe  ] . 
[PER Zapatero  ] argues that [ORG Aznar  ] 's tilt to the [LOC US  ] has damaged [LOC Spain  ] 's standing in the [ORG EU  ] , where the Socialists see their country 's future . 
[PER Zapatero  ] has been a relentless critic of [ORG Aznar  ] 's [LOC Iraq  ] policy and what he sees as [ORG Aznar  ] 's " subservience " to the [ORG Bush Administration  ] . 
[PER Zapatero  ] says he will establish a transatlantic relationship based on " mutual respect and friendship , " not on submission. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Zapatero  ] also strongly criticized [ORG Aznar  ] for appearing before a joint meeting of [ORG Congress  ] February 4 , saying that [ORG Aznar  ] was willing to go before the [ORG US Congress  ] while ignoring Socialist calls for him to appear before a special session of the [MISC Spanish  ] parliament ( in recess because of the elections ) to explain pre-war intelligence on [MISC WMD  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
On the domestic front , [PER Zapatero  ] pledges to increase social spending for education , health and culture . 
He has promised not to raise taxes and says he will pay for these programs by reducing defense spending. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Despite efforts to shift attention again to [LOC Iraq  ] , [PER Zapatero  ] has been unable to turn popular opposition to [ORG Aznar  ] 's [LOC Iraq  ] policy ( which brought millions of Spaniards into the streets in February and March 2003 ) into support for his candidacy . 
On February 12 , [PER Zapatero  ] said that if elected , he would withdraw [MISC Spanish  ] troops from [LOC Iraq  ] in July if the mission had not been turned over to the [ORG UN  ] by that date . 
[PER Zapatero  ] misses no opportunity to call the war " illegal and immoral " and to denounce [ORG Aznar  ] for ignoring [MISC Spanish  ] interests by allying [LOC Spain  ] with what [PER Zapatero  ] calls " the most conservative [ORG US Administration  ] in history . 
" Role of [ORG Aznar  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The manager of the [ORG PP  ] 's national campaign , [PER Gabriel Elorriaga  ] ( who is also State Secretary for [ORG Public Administration  ] ) , told us in late January that one of the major challenges for the [ORG PP  ] in the campaign is how to deploy [ORG Aznar  ] . 
[PER Elorriaga  ] conceded that the [ORG PP  ] needs to be careful not to overshadow [PER Rajoy  ] or antagonize the Socialist ranks and provoke greater Socialist turnout . 
Nonetheless , thus far , and consistent with his personal style , [ORG Aznar  ] has been out in front ) and far more on the attack than [PER Rajoy  ] . 
On February 10 , in a typical jibe , [ORG Aznar  ] declared that the Socialists have no coherent leader or party and are not fit to govern [LOC Spain  ] . 
He demanded that [PER Zapatero  ] tell [MISC Catalan  ] Socialists to break their coalition with the [MISC Catalan  ] [MISC Republican  ] [ORG ERC  ] , whose leader , [PER Carod Robira  ] , met with [ORG ETA  ] leaders in [LOC France  ] in early January. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Zapatero  ] continues to focus his criticism largely on [ORG Aznar  ] , rather than [PER Rajoy  ] . 
[PER Rajoy  ] 's strategists tell us privately that this suits them just fine because the [LOC Iraq  ] issue in particular is identified with [ORG Aznar  ] , rather than [PER Rajoy  ] . 
Thus [ORG Aznar  ] takes the heat while [PER Rajoy  ] enjoys a widespread reputation , even among Socialists , as more of a bridge-builder , with a far less dominating personality than [ORG Aznar.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Some in his own party have criticized [PER Rajoy  ] , a veteran of eight years in key Ministerial portfolios in [ORG Aznar  ] 's two governments , for conducting an overly scripted and risk-averse " rose garden " campaign . 
[PER Rajoy  ] has resisted pressure from the Socialists to publicly debate [PER Zapatero  ] , for example . 
Others point out , however , that Spaniards vote according to party lists , not necessarily on personalities -- a key difference between the [MISC Spanish  ] and [LOC US  ] systems -- and therefore the lack of a high profile is not necessarily a negative for [PER Rajoy  ] . 
Absolute Majority: the Numbers and Turnout <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [ORG PP  ] needs 176 seats in the 350-seat [ORG Congress  ] of Deputies ( lower house ) to form an absolute majority . 
In 2000 , the [ORG PP  ] won an absolute majority of 183 seats . 
In 1996 the [ORG PP  ] won 146 seats and formed a coalition government . 
Some of the 1996 coalition partners , such as the [ORG Basque Nationalist PNV  ] , would not enter into a coalition with [ORG PP  ] today. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [ORG PP  ] campaign manager [PER Elorriaga  ] told us he was confident the [ORG PP  ] would win at least 171 seats this time and said that if the campaign went well , the [ORG PP  ] could hope for an absolute majority , although he conceded this would be difficult . 
[PER Elorriaga  ] believed that the 183 seats the [ORG PP  ] received in 2000 represented the [ORG PP  ] 's electoral ceiling . 
He doubted they would reach it in 2004 given the eight years of [ORG PP  ] government and the natural desire of the public for a change. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Should the [ORG PP  ] fall four or five seats short of 176 , [PER Elorriaga  ] said they can count on the [ORG Canary Coalition  ] ( a regional [LOC Canary Islands  ] party ) to cover that margin . 
Beyond that , coalition formation becomes problematic for the [ORG PP  ] . 
Most [ORG PP  ] analysts believe that [ORG CIU  ] , the moderate [MISC Catalan  ] nationalist party ( which had 15 seats last legislature ) , would be willing to work out a deal with the [ORG PP  ] , if it came to that . 
However [ORG PP  ] strategists are not sure this would happen and would like to avoid this contingency. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [ORG PP  ] strategists and other analysts , including [PER Elorriaga  ] , focused on the issue of voter turnout . 
[PER Elorriaga  ] told us that the [ORG PP  ] wanted to mobilize its people but avoid public gloating that could antagonize the Socialists and mobilize them against the [ORG PP  ] . 
He said polls before the 1993 general election had been favorable for the [ORG PP  ] but that the [ORG PP  ] had committed the error of holding large rallies on the eve of the election that , ironically , mobilized the socialists against them and helped cost the [ORG PP  ] the election . 
[PER Elorriaga  ] said that over-confidence was a major danger for the [ORG PP  ] . 
The Alternative to a [ORG PP  ] Victory: Government of the [ORG Left <a  ] id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The likely alternative to a [ORG PP  ] victory is a coalition of the Socialists and the [LOC Left Union  ] ( [ORG Communists  ] ) supported by nationalists such as the [ORG Basque Nationalist Party  ] ( [ORG PNV  ] ) . 
[PER Zapatero  ] has stated that he would not seek to form a government unless the Socialists get the most votes nationwide . 
Nonetheless , many analysts believe that if it came to it , the [MISC Socialists  ] would lead such an " anybody but the [ORG PP  ] " coalition . 
The [ORG PSOE  ] sought to do it in the [LOC Madrid  ] region last October and have done it in the [LOC Balearic Islands  ] and elsewhere . 
Comment <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) The percepction in [LOC Spain  ] is that the March 14 election remains the [ORG PP  ] 's to lose . 
Despite polls that show that a majority of Spaniards favors the idea of a change in government , the [ORG PP  ] has enjoyed a solid lead for months . 
The Socialists , as a consequence of their disunity and weak leadership , have been unable to capitalize on a general desire for change . 
However , there are a few wildcards that have the potential to change the equation . 
These include possible large [MISC Spanish  ] casualties in [LOC Iraq  ] and a possible backfiring of [PER Rajoy  ] 's cautious approach to campaigning and his unwillingness to debate [PER Zapatero  ] . 
Nonetheless , as it now stands , the majority of analysts , including many Socialist contacts , expect the [ORG PP  ] to form the next government . 
What they do not agree on is whether the [ORG PP  ] will receive an absolute majority . 
The polling is inconclusive . 
If [PER Zapatero  ] can prevent the [ORG PP  ] from gaining an absolute majority ) which would involve the [ORG PP  ] 's loss of at least 8 seats ) he might be able to claim some victory and remain [ORG PSOE  ] leader . 
Should the [ORG PP  ] win an absolute majority , the knives among the Socialists may well come out for [PER Zapatero  ] . 
A resounding [ORG PSOE  ] electoral defeat , were it to occur , might well bring calls for one of the longtime Socialist barons , such as Bono from [LOC Castilla La Mancha  ] or [LOC Chavez  ] from [LOC Andalusia  ] to come to the [ORG PSOE  ] 's rescue .
