( C ) SUMMARY: Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] told Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] on July 20 the [ORG EU  ] has not yet reached consensus on lifting the [LOC China  ] Arms Embargo before the December [MISC EU-China  ] summit . 
While strong voices in the [ORG EU  ] are pushing for a quick ( but not unconditional ) lift , others now appear less convinced and a final decision has not yet been made . 
On [LOC Turkey  ] , [PER Balkenende  ] reiterated that a deal is a deal and the [ORG EU  ] 's decision will depend on the [ORG European Commission  ] 's October report , the drafting of which the [MISC Dutch  ] are following closely . 
Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] urged the [ORG EU  ] to maintain pressure on [PER Arafat  ] and the [MISC Palestinians  ] to make needed reforms , and noted that the [ORG Forum for the Future  ] proposed at the [MISC G-8  ] summit provided a good venue for [MISC EU-U.S.  ] cooperation on the region . 
Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] also raised [LOC Sudan  ] briefly and noted standing requests for additional security for the Embassy . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] met with [MISC Dutch  ] Prime Minister [PER Jan Pieter Balkenende  ] on July 20 to discuss the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG EU  ] Presidency and related issues prior to the [MISC Dutch  ] cabinet going on vacation . 
[PER Balkenende  ] noted that he would be taking the traditional long [MISC Dutch  ] vacation in August , but would remain in the [LOC Netherlands  ] in case Presidency business required his involvement . 
During the nearly one-hour discussion , [PER Balkenende  ] and the Ambassador discussed the [LOC China  ] Arms Embargo , [MISC Turkish  ] accession to the [ORG EU  ] , and the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
[PER Balkenende  ] was accompanied by his chief foreign policy advisor , [PER Rob Swartbol  ] ; POLCOUNS ( notetaker ) accompanied Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] . 
[LOC CHINA  ] ARMS EMBARGO: MORE THAN ONE OPTION ? ------------------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] stressed that the [LOC China  ] Arms Embargo was quickly rising to the top of the [MISC U.S.-EU  ] agenda . 
[MISC Chinese  ] backsliding on human rights over the past two years was deeply troubling , as was the continued [MISC Chinese  ] threat to regional stability . 
Lifting the arms embargo before seeing real progress in these areas , he stressed , ran counter to the [MISC Dutch  ] step by step approach , would be counterproductive in terms of influencing [MISC Chinese  ] behavior . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] were still refusing to allow the [ORG UN  ] 's special rapporteur on torture , van [LOC Boven  ] , to visit despite having earlier agreed to do so , he noted . 
( [PER Balkenende  ] suggested that the [MISC Chinese  ] might have problems with van [LOC Boven  ] himself , rather than with his office , noting that the [MISC Spanish  ] had also had problems with van [LOC Boven  ] . 
) The [ORG Code of Conduct  ] , he added , was not an adequate substitute for the embargo , and we strongly doubted the [ORG EU  ] 's ability to put stronger mechanisms in place . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] was looking to the [MISC Dutch  ] , as [ORG EU  ] president , to make sure that the [LOC U.S.  ] was not surprised by developments in this area. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) In response , [PER Balkenende  ] said that the [LOC China  ] Arms Embargo was a sensitive and evolving issue within the [ORG EU  ] . 
At one point , there seemed to be a strong consensus for a quick lift , he said , but now other tendencies could be emerging . 
Even [ORG Chirac  ] , [PER Balkenende  ] added , now was less adamant about lifting the embargo than in the past . 
( [PER Balkenende  ] noted that [ORG Chirac  ] had earlier tried at the last minute to insert language on lifting the embargo into a Council statement , but had backed down when challenged . 
) He stressed that all views would be taken into account before making a decision , and denied that the [ORG EU  ] was prepared to lift the embargo without any conditions . 
[LOC China  ] would have to take some steps ( NFI ) to merit a decision to lift , he stated . 
That said , the desire to strengthen [MISC EU-China  ] ties in the near term was very strong within the [ORG EU  ] . 
The arms embargo was one instrument the [ORG EU  ] could use to influence the relationship , but not the only one. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] reiterated the need for transparency and good communication as the issue developed . 
The [MISC Irish  ] , he pointed out , had not worked actively as president to develop a consensus position , and the issue had naturally moved to the next presidency without a resolution . 
[PER Swartbol  ] intervened to note that while various tendencies did exist within the [ORG EU  ] , the strongest tendency at this point was to lift the embargo , possibly as early as the fall . 
TURKEY: ONCE AGAIN , YES......BUT -------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Turning to [LOC Turkey  ] , Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] took note of [PER Balkenende  ] 's recent positive public statements and asked where the issue currently stood . 
Balkendende observed that the exact wording of the [ORG European Commission  ] 's October report would be critical . 
The report , he predicted , would probably state neither that [LOC Turkey  ] had met all the [LOC Copenhagen  ] criteria fully , nor that it had failed to meet them ; most likely , the report would be positive but identify work remaining to be done . 
In that case , he continued , the two realistic options for the [ORG EU  ] were either: A ) to set a date for accession negotiations , but make it conditional on achieving progress in remaining areas , or B ) to ask [LOC Turkey  ] to take certain specific steps with the clear understanding that a date would be set as soon as they are accomplished . 
7 ( C ) [PER Balkenende  ] reiterated that the [ORG EU  ] must not rewrite the rules to help or hinder [LOC Turkey  ] 's bid for accession -- a deal is a deal . 
Talk of offering the [LOC Turks  ] a privileged partnership or other substitute ( as the [MISC French  ] and others , including [PER Christian Democrats  ] in the [MISC European  ] Parliament , had hinted ) , he stressed , would not be acceptable . 
At the same time , [PER Balkenende  ] made clear that negotiations on accession would probably last for at several years , and that the [LOC Turks  ] , in his view , understood this as well . 
The [MISC Turks'  ] interests would be taken into account in the [ORG EU  ] 's decision , he said , but the decision must also be sustainable domestically throughout the [ORG EU  ] . 
A big part of the [ORG EU  ] 's public relations work , therefore , would be to convince skeptical national parliaments and populations that agreeing to begin negotiations would not lead to a flood of [MISC Turkish  ] immigrants or other undesirable outcomes . 
[PER Balkenende  ] predicted that [ORG Chirac  ] would ultimately side with [LOC Germany  ] despite domestic [MISC French  ] opposition in order to preserve his relationship with [PER Schroeder.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) [PER Balkenende  ] made clear that [LOC U.S.  ] sensitivities would be taken into account as the [ORG EU  ] made its decision , and that the [ORG USG  ] position was well known . 
He urged the [ORG USG  ] , however , not to give opponents to [MISC Turkish  ] accession more fuel by making public statements that appeared provocative in the [MISC European  ] context ; for domestic reasons , [ORG Chirac  ] and other [MISC European  ] leaders would feel compelled to respond to [LOC US  ] statements on the issue . 
Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] stressed that the [ORG USG  ] would be following the issue closely and urged that we be kept informed . 
[PER Swartbol  ] noted that the [ORG Commission  ] had just started the process of drafting its report . 
He strongly suggested that the [MISC Dutch  ] ( and he personally ) would be able to follow and perhaps influence the drafting process , albeit behind the scenes . 
[ORG MIDDLE EAST:  ] KEEPING [ORG EU  ] PRESSURE ON ARAFAT ; [ORG FORUM FOR  ] THE FUTURE --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] stressed that developments in the [LOC Middle East  ] made it imperative to keep pressure on [PER Yasser Arafat  ] to reform . 
The situation is developing quickly , and the [ORG EU  ] 's special relationship with the [MISC Palestinians  ] could a useful force for bringing about needed changes . 
On the Broader [ORG Middle East/North Africa  ] initiative , Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] highlighted the [ORG Forum for the Future  ] announced at the [LOC G-8 Sea Island  ] summit . 
[LOC SUDAN  ] AND SECURITY ------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In closing , Ambassador briefly raised the crisis in [LOC Sudan  ] and urged the [ORG EU  ] to free up funding quickly to support the [ORG AU  ] peacekeeping force . 
He also noted that the Embassy had requested additional security measures two years ago which it had not yet received . 
[PER Balkenende  ] promised to bring up the matter personally with the minister of interior .
