( C/NF ) Key points: -- Poll numbers for PM [PER Gordon Brown  ] and his [ORG Labour Party  ] have dropped following the April 22 budget presentation , with an April 24 poll showing the opposition [ORG Conservative Party  ] with an 18 point lead over [ORG Labour  ] . 
If an election were held now , according to these poll numbers , the [MISC Tories  ] would win a staggering 150-seat majority in Parliament . 
-- The past two weeks have been wretched for [PER Brown  ] and [ORG Labour  ] , who have endured a gloomy budget presentation and a particularly ugly new scandal , popularly known as “Smeargate , ” involving a top [PER Brown  ] advisor’s plan to plant false rumors on the internet about senior [ORG Conservative Party  ] figures . 
Even after the PM personally apologized for Smeargate , the media and the [MISC Tories  ] have sought to implicate more of [MISC Brown’s  ] close allies . 
The scandal also may have forced [PER Brown  ] to cancel what a plan to call the next general election this spring , when he had hoped to capitalize on his successful performance at the [MISC G-20  ] summit . 
-- [MISC Brown’s  ] attempts to close loop holes in the parliamentary [MISC Second Homes  ] Allowances , which according to media reports many of the most senior members of [ORG Brown’s Cabinet  ] have used for personal gain , have been opposed by the [ORG Conservatives  ] and third-party [MISC Liberal Democrats  ] ; one [PER Tory MP  ] told us [MISC Brown’s  ] plan would allow “endemic featherbedding and graft.” End key points . 
[ORG Labour Poll Numbers Collapse Following Gloomy Budget  ] , New Scandal --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER David Cameron  ] and the opposition [ORG Conservative Party  ] have an 18 point lead in the polls over [PER Gordon Brown  ] and the [ORG Labour Party  ] , according to the first poll following the April 22 presentation of the budget . 
A [ORG YouGov  ] poll for the [ORG Daily Telegraph  ] published April 24 found the [ORG Conservatives  ] are at 45 percent , up four points from March , while [ORG Labour  ] is down four points to 27 percent and the third-party [MISC Liberal Democrats  ] are at 18 percent . 
According to these figures , if the elections were held today , the [MISC Tories  ] would sweep to power with an astonishing 150-seat majority in Parliament - more than double the 63-seat majority that [ORG Labour  ] now holds . 
Sixty-nine percent of respondents said they were dissatisfied with [MISC Brown’s  ] performance as Prime Minister , while 56 percent said they were satisfied with [MISC Cameron’s  ] performance as [PER Tory Leader  ] . 
Thirty-nine percent thought the [ORG Conservatives  ] would be more likely to run the economy well , while only 24 percent approved of Labour’s current handling of the economy. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) The causes of this collapse in [PER Brown  ] and Labour’s poll numbers , which had rebounded slightly following the [MISC G-20  ] before subsiding again ( Ref B ) , are a gloomy budget presentation by Chancellor [PER Alistair Darling  ] on April 22 ( Ref A ) , mounting media reports of [MISC MP  ] abuse of a parliamentary allowance for second homes which has engulfed [PER Brown  ] and many members of his cabinet ( Ref B ) -- and a new and particularly ugly scandal . 
Dubbed “Smeargate” by the media , it erupted on April 10 , when the media obtained leaked emails from PM Special Adviser [PER Damian McBride  ] in which [PER McBride  ] attempted to launch an internet smear campaign against [PER Cameron  ] , Shadow Chancellor [PER George Osborne  ] , [PER Osborne  ] , s wife [PER Frances  ] , [MISC MP  ] [PER Nadine Dorries  ] , and another unnamed [PER Tory MP  ] . 
The smears themselves , which have been described in salacious detail on the internet , were more delicately described in the April 14 Guardian as including “rumors involving the wife of the Shadow Chancellor , the health of [PER Cameron  ] , the personal relations of [MISC MP  ] [PER Nadine Dorries  ] and accusations that a [PER Tory MP  ] was promoting his partner’s business interests in the [ORG Commons.”  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) [PER McBride  ] resigned on April 11 , claiming that he had merely written up a list of “stories doing the rounds in [LOC Westminster  ] , ” and that he had never actually intended them to be published . 
Unpopular within the [ORG Labour Party  ] according to our contacts , and a particularly unpleasant person based on our own experiences with him , [PER McBride  ] was one of [MISC Brown’s  ] closest advisors , having followed him to [ORG No.  ] 10 [LOC Downing Street  ] from the [ORG Treasury  ] . 
[PER Brown  ] disclaimed all knowledge of McBride’s antics , but critics were quick to point out McBride’s close relationship to [PER Brown  ] , and that [PER McBride  ] had used his [ORG No.  ] 10 email account to send the smear rumors . 
In any case , they argued , PM [PER Brown  ] holds final responsibility [LOC LONDON  ] 00000956 002 OF 003 for any such tactics coming out of [ORG No.  ] 10 . 
After private written apologies to the parties concerned didn’t work , [PER Brown  ] apologized personally for Smeargate on April 17 . 
Nonetheless , his poll numbers dropped , with 37 percent of voters in an April 19 poll by [ORG News of the World  ] saying they found [ORG Labour  ] less trustworthy than before Smeargate broke . 
The media sought to implicate more members of [MISC Brown’s  ] inner circle , including Education Secretary [PER Ed Balls  ] , who was forced to deny that he runs a “smear unit” inside [LOC Downing Street  ] . 
Former [ORG Labour  ] MP [PER Alice Mahon  ] resigned from the [ORG Labour Party  ] April 18 , telling the press , “I can no longer be a member of a party that at the leadership level has betrayed many of the values and principles that inspired me as a teenager to join.” Although [PER Mahon  ] maintained a low profile during her tenure in Parliament , her resignation was head line news . 
And Unison , a public-sector union representing 1.3 million workers , announced publicly that it would withhold GBP 1.8 million in annual dues to the [ORG Labour Party  ] - one-tenth of Labour’s yearly funding - if [PER Brown  ] didn’t put a stop to smear tactics. “Smeargate” Wrecks [PER Gordon Brown’s Plans  ] for [ORG Early Elections  ] --------------------------------------------- -------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) Perhaps most damaging of all , however , Smeargate effectively ended what may have been [MISC Brown’s  ] plan to call a general election this spring , based on the rise in the polls he received following his solid performance at the [MISC G-20  ] . 
[ORG Labour Prospective Parliamentary  ] Candidate for [PER Burton Ruth Smeeth  ] ( strictly protect ) told us April 20 that [PER Brown  ] had intended to announce the elections on May 12 , and hold them after a very short ( matter of weeks ) campaign season . 
[ORG Labour  ] had been “just” 7 points behind the [ORG Conservatives  ] in some polls taken right after the [LOC G-20 Summit  ] , which other [ORG Labour  ] contacts had told us was close to an acceptable standing from which to launch a campaign , but the drop in Labour’s poll numbers following Smeargate forced [PER Brown  ] to abandon his plan , a despondent [PER Smeeth  ] said . 
( Note: This information has not been reported in the press . 
End note . 
) Opposition [MISC Parties Oppose Plans  ] To [MISC Abolish Second Homes  ] Allowance --------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) At the same time as the budget and Smeargate dominated the headlines , [PER Brown  ] and [ORG Labour  ] were continuing to take media fire over the controversial Second Homes Allowance , which is designed to cover the costs that MPs incur by maintaining a home in their constituencies as well as a residence in [LOC London  ] . 
In recent weeks , the media has highlighted attempts by prominent Government ministers to maximize their claims against this allowance in ways that , while not strictly illegal , amount to bilking the tax payer . 
The politicians in the [LOC UK  ] snared in the public outrage over the practice include Chancellor of the Exchequer [PER Alistair Darling  ] , Home Secretary [PER Jacqui Smith  ] , and even [PER Brown  ] himself . 
Talks among party leaders on the PM’s plans to abolish the Second Homes Allowance and replace it with a daily attendance allowance was rejected by both the [MISC Tories  ] and the [PER Lib Dems  ] , however , during a tense and heated meeting April 22 that broke down after 40 minutes . 
[PER Tory MP Keith Simpson  ] ( strictly protect ) told us April 23 that the [ORG Conservatives  ] at first thought they would have no option but to back the proposed reforms or face criticism from [ORG Labour  ] . 
Once the [MISC Tories  ] understood , however , that the public perceived the proposal for a daily allowance as a copy of the system used for [MISC European  ] Parliamentarians - a system which he described as allowing “endemic featherbedding and graft” in [LOC Brussels  ] - the [PER Tory  ] leadership decided it was politically acceptable to attack the reform proposals . 
[PER Simpson  ] told us that the inability of the [ORG Brown Government  ] to achieve cross-party support for the reforms is a sign of how “listless and ineffective this government has become , ” because this kind of reform is something “any effective government could have been able to nail down long before going public with it.” Comment ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) While the media has begun to trot out the usual pundits who claim that [PER Brown  ] can’t last until the next election , as we have reported , there is virtually no chance either that he will step down voluntarily , or that an alternative leader will step forward to challenge him . 
Not only is replacing a sitting [ORG Labour  ] leader an arduous task procedurally ( Ref C ) , but we assess it unlikely that any [ORG Labour  ] politician with his or her eye on the future would want to take on the sinking ship that is the current [ORG Labour Party  ] at this time of crisis . 
It is more likely that [ORG Labour  ] will go down in the next election - and then will begin the [LOC LONDON  ] 00000956 003 OF 003 process of rebuilding .
