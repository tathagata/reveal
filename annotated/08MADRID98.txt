End Summary . 
[ORG Prince  ] of [LOC Asturias  ] ------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Shortly after their arrival January 10 , [PER Senators Martinez  ] , [PER Grassley  ] , [PER Thune  ] , and [PER Craig  ] were received by the [ORG Prince  ] of [LOC Asturias  ] at [LOC Zarzuela Palace  ] . 
The [ORG Prince  ] stressed the importance for [LOC Spain  ] of maintaining excellent relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] and his commitment to improving those relations . 
The [ORG Prince  ] reminisced happily about his travels in the [LOC U.S.  ] and expressed a great fondness for the country . 
He had clearly been following the [LOC U.S.  ] Presidential primaries and sought the [MISC Senators'  ] views on the process . 
[PER Mariano Rajoy  ] ------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The delegation met at [ORG PP  ] headquarters with presidential candidate [PER Mariano Rajoy  ] . 
[PER Rajoy  ] noted that with less than two months to go before the [MISC Spanish  ] general elections , the polls showed him in a tie with [PER Zapatero  ] and his [MISC Spanish  ] Socialist Workers , Party ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) . 
[PER Rajoy  ] said his campaign would focus on the economy , nationalism , and terrorism . 
On the economy , he said polls showed it to be the number one issue . 
[PER Rajoy  ] said [PER Zapatero  ] had lived for four years off the inheritance of the previous [ORG PP  ] , s government 's good economic management . 
[PER Rajoy  ] said the macroeconomic indicators were still good , but people were beginning to feel the pinch of inflation running above the [ORG EU  ] average . 
He also said interest rates were rising , a serious worry in a nation of 44 million with eight million mortgages . 
[PER Rajoy  ] said [PER Zapatero  ] had not defended [LOC Spain  ] , the oldest national identity in [LOC Europe  ] , from the demands of radical regional groups with nationalistic aspirations . 
On terrorism , [PER Rajoy  ] contrasted [ORG PP  ] firmness with [PER Zapatero  ] , s attempt to negotiate with [MISC ETA.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In foreign policy , [PER Rajoy  ] said he would defend democracy , freedom , human rights , and [MISC Western  ] values . 
He said [LOC Spain  ] ( and [LOC Europe  ] ) needed the best possible relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Rajoy  ] noted [LOC Spain  ] had once been a reliable ally of the [LOC U.S.  ] He promised that as President he would speak his mind and avoid surprises . 
[PER Rajoy  ] said [LOC Spain  ] should play a significant role in [LOC Latin America  ] and should promote democracy , freedom , and human rights in the region , which was suffering some unacceptable leaders at the moment . 
He said the [ORG PP  ] position regarding [LOC Venezuela  ] was well known: populism was not the direction the people of [LOC Latin America  ] were moving . 
He expressed strong disagreement with [PER Zapatero  ] , s [LOC Cuba  ] policy and voiced concern over treatment of dissidents in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[PER Rajoy  ] noted [LOC Spain  ] , s position on [LOC Cuba  ] was important within the [ORG EU  ] . 
[PER Rajoy  ] insisted he would fulfill [LOC Spain  ] , s commitments abroad , which would be in defense of [MISC Western  ] values . 
He said it was difficult but the public would understand the need for overseas engagement if the problems were explained to them . 
He said [LOC Spain  ] would continue in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and noted the while in opposition the [ORG PP  ] had supported sending troops abroad . 
[PER Rajoy  ] said the [ORG PP  ] opposed [LOC Spain  ] , s 2004 withdrawal from [LOC Iraq  ] , which he characterized as a mistake , albeit one that won the [ORG PSOE  ] votes. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Although he did not indicate he would make it a campaign issue , [PER Rajoy  ] noted [LOC Spain  ] was number two in the world behind the [LOC U.S.  ] in terms of the numbers of immigrants received . 
Over ten percent of the population was of foreign origin , and there was a large [MISC Muslim  ] immigrant population . 
He said immigration was beginning to cause problems , as ordinary [MISC Spaniards  ] saw their access to social services affected ( he mentioned public health was 40 percent of [LOC Spain  ] , s budget ) . 
He said the [ORG PP  ] was against illegal immigration and in favor of orderly migration flows . 
He condemned [PER Zapatero  ] , s amnesty for nearly one million illegal immigrants , saying it had drawn new immigrants and noted that migratory pressures from [LOC Africa  ] were only increasing. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Rajoy  ] mentioned that while Minister of Interior he was the first [MISC European  ] minister to visit the [LOC U.S.  ] after the [LOC MADRID  ] 00000098 002 OF 005 9/11 attacks . 
He said the [LOC West  ] needed to invest more resources in educating people about democratic values . 
He criticized the [PER Zapatero  ] government , s [ORG Alliance of Civilizations  ] ( [ORG AOC  ] ) effort , saying it was an electoral ploy . 
He said the left wing in [LOC Spain  ] and elsewhere tried to use the popular media and entertainment figures to convince people that they favored peace while center right parties such as the [ORG PP  ] in [LOC Spain  ] favored war . 
He said this had to be countered through education. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Asked about voter turnout , [PER Rajoy  ] said this was a big unknown . 
He said in 2000 the [ORG PP  ] won an absolute majority in [ORG Congress  ] . 
In 2004 , they lost by about five percent because [PER Zapatero  ] was able to mobilize socialist voters using the [LOC Iraq  ] war and the [MISC Atocha  ] bombings . 
He characterized 2004 as a vote against the [ORG PP  ] rather than for the [ORG PSOE  ] . 
[PER Rajoy  ] predicted the anti-PP vote would not be there this year . 
He said the [ORG PP  ] base was very loyal and would vote , so the question was many socialist actually turned out . 
He noted in 2004 polls should him eight points ahead the day of the [MISC Atocha  ] bombings , and he lost by five points the following Sunday . 
[PER Rajoy  ] noted that the polls in the 2007 municipal elections predicted [ORG PP  ] defeat . 
In fact , the [ORG PP  ] won . 
He said turnout and loyalty were key . 
He claimed polls showed 85 percent of [ORG PP  ] voters were loyal but only 72 percent of [ORG PSOE  ] voters . 
He said his strategy was to reach out to the center and the opposition rather than to his base . 
He said this was to avoid mobilizing the [ORG PSOE  ] base and increasing their turnout . 
[PER Rajoy  ] mentioned that convincing the media which supported the [ORG PP  ] to avoid antagonizing the left was a challenge . 
Noting he had been campaign manager both times , he noted [PER Aznar  ] , s 1996 campaign was aggressive whereas in the even more successful 2000 campaign the [ORG PP  ] had behaved like nuns . 
[PER Rajoy  ] said the costs of campaigning in [LOC Spain  ] were negligible compared to the [LOC U.S.  ] He said in [LOC Spain  ] , as opposed to the [LOC U.S.  ] , it was important not to let people know how much money you had raised since voters would turn against the candidate with the most money . 
He noted the parties were prohibited from buying advertising until the last two weeks , and so they had to earn media coverage in the meantime and were heavily focused on the internet , which he said was the only way to reach young voters . 
He said the party was commissioning two polls a month and would move to daily polling in the last two weeks ( [PER Rajoy  ] joked that after long and intensive study of the science of polling he had concluded he knew nothing about polls ) . 
He said most of the [ORG PP  ] money would be spent on radio and billboard advertising . 
He noted he was on the trail four out of every seven days . 
[PER Rajoy  ] said the debates , scheduled for February 25 and March 3 , could be decisive since they came so late in the process . 
He mentioned that the [ORG PP  ] was also hitting family issues , noting the [ORG PSOE  ] favored gay marriage . 
[PER Rajoy  ] said there were 1.5 million absentee voters , a number he said was significant in terms of the [MISC Spanish  ] electorate . 
He recalled that in a recent election the [ORG PP  ] had lost a seat in [LOC Galicia  ] because [PER Hugo Chavez  ] had sequestered the mail from [LOC Venezuela  ] , which [PER Rajoy  ] was sure contained a heavy [ORG PP  ] vote since [MISC Spaniards  ] there were unhappy with the [ORG PSOE  ] , s failure to stand up to [PER Chavez  ] . 
[PER Rajoy  ] mentioned the [ORG PP  ] had an office in [LOC Washington  ] and their representative there was part of the party , s governing committee . 
He also sought the [MISC Senators  ] , views on the [LOC U.S.  ] Presidential campaign . 
[PER Jose Maria Aznar  ] ---------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On January 11 [ORG CODEL Martinez  ] held a wide-ranging discussion with former [MISC Spanish  ] President [PER Jose Maria Aznar  ] that touched on the electoral outlook in [LOC Spain  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] , as well as [PER Aznar  ] , s strong opinions on [LOC Kosovo  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] , and the [ORG Alliance of Civilizations  ] . 
President [PER Aznar  ] told the [ORG CODEL  ] that he held real reservations about [LOC Kosovo  ] 's independence , concerns he mentioned he had conveyed to Senator [PER Lieberman  ] the night before . 
[PER Aznar  ] said he believed international acceptance of a unilateral declaration of independence ( [ORG UDI  ] ) would lead to three undesirable results: the de facto acceptance of changed borders in [LOC Europe  ] as a consequence of " blackmail ; " the establishment of a principle of self-determination that would have ramifications in [LOC Spain  ] , [LOC Italy  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , and other states with minority populations ; and the rise of nationalism on the [MISC European  ] continent . 
[PER Aznar  ] said he feared the explosive mixture of nationalism and changing borders and would prefer [LOC Kosovo  ] remain a protectorate for the next century rather than have a [ORG UDI  ] be accepted by much of the international community. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Aznar  ] opined that [LOC Turkey  ] 's [ORG EU  ] bid was impossible at present and would continue to be so for perhaps the next 15 years . 
The former president said that while [LOC Europe  ] should certainly look to forge and maintain a special relationship with [LOC Turkey  ] , it was hard for him to imagine a Muslim-majority country fitting into a [LOC Europe  ] of [MISC Christian  ] roots . 
He said [LOC MADRID  ] 00000098 003 OF 005 that [ORG EU  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] leaders needed to consider just what the [LOC Turkey  ] factor would mean to [LOC Europe  ] with the addition of 100 million [MISC Muslims.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Aznar  ] voiced skepticism regarding the [ORG AOC  ] . 
He said during his term in office he visited [LOC Iran  ] and worked closely with former [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Khatemi  ] to establish a dialogue of civilizations , but that he could not see the desirability or feasibility of forming an alliance with figures such as Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] . 
[PER Aznar  ] said that the [ORG AOC  ] was not in the best interests of the [LOC West  ] . 
He mentioned that he maintains good relations with [MISC Turkish  ] President [PER Erdogan  ] and claimed to have it on good authority that [PER Erdogan  ] was taking an active role in [PER Zapatero  ] , s [ORG AOC  ] not because he necessarily believed in it , but because he hoped it would help [LOC Turkey  ] , s [ORG EU  ] bid. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Aznar  ] concluded the meeting with a discussion of the role of his think tank , the [ORG Foundation for Social Analysis and Studies  ] ( [ORG FAES  ] ) . 
He said that [ORG FAES  ] was set up in the [MISC European  ] liberal tradition and was intended to defend the values of the western world and an [MISC Atlantic  ] policy . 
[ORG FAES  ] seeks to strengthen the [MISC U.S.-EU  ] pillar and believes that an [ORG Atlantic Europe  ] is the only possibility for the continent . 
[ORG Renewable Energy  ] ---------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) At a lunch on renewable energy hosted by the [ORG American Chamber of Commerce  ] , the [MISC Senators  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] companies discussed the status of several forms of renewable and low-emission energy . 
Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] and AmCham president [PER Jaime Malet  ] opened with remarks describing [MISC Spanish  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] leadership in the sector and emphasizing the amount of [MISC Spanish  ] investment in renewables projects in the [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] described the February renewable energy trade and investment mission post is organizing with the GOS to bring [MISC Spanish  ] government officials and companies to the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Senators  ] [PER Grassley  ] and [PER Thune  ] discussed biofuels , which Senator [PER Grassley  ] noted were likely to shift away from the present emphasis on corn-based ethanol to cellulose-based ethanol after the next 5-10 years . 
[MISC Senators  ] [PER Grassley  ] and [PER Thune  ] explained their states , favorable location for wind power ( [LOC Iowa  ] has [MISC Spanish  ] investment in both wind farms and a wind turbine manufacturing plant ) , while Senator [PER Martinez  ] noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] , geographic variability meant that an identical national renewable portfolio standard for each state would be unfair to states such as [LOC Florida  ] that lacked commercially viable quantities of wind . 
Senator [PER Craig  ] and Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] emphasized the importance of technological advances in addressing energy dependence and climate change . 
Senator [PER Craig  ] described [LOC U.S.  ] climate change policy , outlined the [LOC U.S.  ] national energy laboratories , role in technological research , and reviewed issues related to nuclear and clean coal technology . 
[MISC Spanish  ] company representatives described [LOC Spain  ] , s system of incentives for electricity from renewable sources ( [LOC Spain  ] , s system is based on guaranteed prices , while [LOC U.S.  ] incentives are mainly tax-related ) and expressed interest in investment opportunities in the [LOC U.S.  ] in electricity transmission as well as generation . 
Participants from both countries emphasized the importance of encouraging renewable energy as an alternative to dependence upon hydrocarbon imports from undemocratic suppliers . 
[MISC Cuban  ] Dissidents ---------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Senators Martinez  ] and [PER Craig  ] , joined by the Ambassador and Deputy Chief of Mission , met January 11 with [MISC Cuban  ] dissidents [PER Hector Palacios  ] and his wife [PER Gisela Delgado  ] . 
[PER Palacios  ] briefed the [MISC Senators  ] on his personal situation saying he had been released from jail at the petition of the [MISC Spanish  ] Government in order to come to [LOC Spain  ] to receive medical treatment . 
While appreciated [LOC Spain  ] , s help , he did not agree with [LOC Spain  ] , s policy of engagement with the [MISC Cuban  ] regime or with gestures such as the 2007 [ORG Moratinos  ] visit to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
He said he and his wife had made public statements critical of [MISC Spanish  ] policy and as a result the [MISC Spanish  ] had cut his per diem allowance and moved him to a cheaper hotel . 
He said [ORG Moratinos  ] had not seen him and instead he dealt with the Director General for [MISC Iberoamerica.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Palacios  ] said political control in [LOC Cuba  ] was fragmenting into three or four different groups . 
[PER Fidel  ] had been the glue that held it together . 
Each group had a somewhat different agenda their common goal was to stay in power . 
[PER Palacios  ] said [LOC Cuba  ] was ripe for change . 
He said the military would not be a major obstacle once change began because conscription meant that the military reflected the people . 
Also , [PER Fidel  ] , s policy of rotating troops regularly underneath their officers had had its intended effect of [LOC MADRID  ] 00000098 004 OF 005 preventing the formation of units personally loyal to their commanders . 
He said a greater problem would the large system of repression [PER Fidel  ] had created ( the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] , neighborhood committees , bands of thugs who attacked and intimidated dissidents ) . 
There were about 200,000 people in this system and they were the ones who lived well and who had a great deal to lose . 
Even those within government would find these people a formidable obstacle if they tried to promote change. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Palacios  ] said [LOC U.S.  ] assistance was not reaching the dissidents . 
He noted the irony of being jailed as an agent of [LOC U.S.  ] imperialism when the actual amount of [ORG USG  ] funding was minimal . 
He said they ran into problems doing things as simple as finding the small amounts of money needed to bring dissidents from one part of the island to another to attend demonstrations . 
He said he planned to travel to [LOC Washington  ] and [LOC Miami  ] soon and intended to raise this issue in both places . 
[ORG National Security Advisor Casajuana and Foreign Minister Moratinos  ] --------------------------------------------- ----------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Senators Martinez  ] and [PER Craig  ] ( joined by Senator [PER Lieberman  ] ) met January 11 with [PER Carles Casajuana  ] and discussed [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] , [LOC Morocco  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] , and the [ORG AOC  ] . 
Also on January 11 , [PER Codel Martinez  ] met with FM [ORG Moratinos  ] where the conversation touched on [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process , [LOC Syria  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] , and the [ORG AOC  ] . 
Both meetings are reported via septels . 
Agricultural Trade Issues ------------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On January 11 , [MISC Senators  ] [PER Charles Grassley  ] and [PER John Thune  ] , together with the Deputy Chief of Mission , [MISC AgCouns  ] and [LOC EconOff  ] , met with the [ORG Ministry of Industry  ] , [ORG Tourism  ] and Trade , s Secretary of State for International Trade , [PER Pedro Mejia  ] , and Secretary General [PER Alfredo Bonet  ] . 
Senator [PER Grassley  ] emphasized the importance of science-based decisions in the agricultural biotechnology context . 
[PER Mejia  ] said that [LOC Spain  ] had a relatively " liberal " view with respect to biotechnology . 
However , even in [LOC Spain  ] the technology was controversial and faced NGO opposition , albeit not as strong as in some other [ORG EU  ] member states . 
Senator [PER Thune  ] asked what influence [LOC Spain  ] could exercise in [LOC Brussels  ] on this issue . 
[PER Bonet  ] noted it was very difficult to get a qualified majority for biotech approvals in the [ORG EU Environment Council  ] so in the end the [ORG Commission  ] was taking decisions in favor of biotechnology . 
Both [PER Mejia  ] and [PER Bonet  ] noted that commodity price hikes might spur greater liberalization on biotech imports . 
The Secretary of State asked about the status of the proposed elimination of the " splash and dash " tax credit loophole that allows biodiesel producers in the [LOC U.S.  ] to import commodities such as soybeans , add a minimal amount of petroleum diesel , and then reexport the biodiesel . 
[MISC European  ] producers have complained about these imports . 
The Senator promised to get back to the Secretary of State on the status of the proposed elimination of the loophole . 
[PER Mejia  ] said that he was pessimistic about the prospects for [LOC Doha  ] because major developing countries were not willing to give sufficiently in terms of industrial and services market access ; he emphasized especially [LOC Spain  ] , s interest in better services access . 
He noted also that with high agricultural commodity prices , some developing countries now did not see why they should give on industrial goods and services access . 
He said that the [LOC U.S.  ] was still under pressure to do more on domestic agricultural support . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's senior trade representative asserted that the [ORG EU  ] had made a good agricultural access offer . 
The [MISC Senators  ] expressed support for [LOC Doha  ] but were pessimistic about getting support for Trade [ORG Promotion Authority  ] ( [ORG TPA  ] ) this year . 
Finally , there was a lively discussion of Secretary of State [PER Mejia  ] 's February energy renewables trip to SIPDIS the [LOC U.S.  ] Both [MISC Senators  ] [PER Grassley  ] and [PER Thune  ] were very interested in the mission . 
( Comment: This was a very good substantive discussion . 
However , it is clear that while [LOC Spain  ] will continue sometimes to vote in favor of biotechnology liberalization proposals , the [MISC Spaniards  ] will tread warily on this issue given their own domestic sensitivities and other equities [LOC Spain  ] has in the [ORG EU  ] . 
It was interesting to hear [PER Mejia  ] , s strong emphasis on services as the future of [LOC Spain  ] , s economy . 
Unfortunately , [MISC Spanish  ] services companies have not been aggressive in promoting [LOC Doha  ] , although this is true of many other services companies in [LOC Europe  ] as well .
