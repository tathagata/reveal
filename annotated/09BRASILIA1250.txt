( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary . 
One year before [LOC Brazil  ] 's October 2010 national elections , [ORG Social Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG PSDB  ] ) presidential candidate [PER Jose Serra  ] continues to lead [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) hopeful [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] in the polls , while [LOC PMDB  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] 's largest party , uses its bargaining leverage to maintain its advantages in parliament and in key state races . 
President [PER Lula  ] has further solidified the [MISC PT-PMDB  ] alliance in recent weeks , but is having difficulty herding the center-left parties in his coalition , some of which are launching their own presidential candidates . 
The October 3 deadline for party switching and electoral reform produced a flurry of movement , including party switches by both the Foreign Minister and the [ORG Central Bank  ] President . 
These moves presaged a potential forthcoming exodus of over half the ministers in [PER Lula  ] 's cabinet by April 3 , the date by which candidates must declare themselves for office ; such an event would dramatically reduce [LOC Brazil  ] 's governing capacity during the campaign season . 
[ORG Congress  ] will likewise lose impetus by April , increasing the need for a strong push by [PER Lula  ] in order to enact Pre-Salt oil exploration and other key legislative objectives considered crucial to the campaign . 
Observers from all sides expect the presidential race to tighten considerably as the election approaches , with the final outcome depending in large part on [PER Lula  ] 's ability to transfer his personal popularity to [PER Dilma  ] while at the same time allowing her to distinguish herself from [PER Lula  ] as a viable presidential figure . 
End summary . 
What 's At [LOC Stake  ] , What 's to Come ------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's national elections , to be held October 3 , 2010 , will feature the largest number of open races for federal and state office in over a generation . 
In addition to the presidential race , 54 of 81 federal senate seats , all 513 federal deputy seats , all 27 governorships , and all state deputy seats will be contested . 
On October 3 , 2009 , the deadlines passed for switching parties or residences in order to run as a candidate from that party/state , and also for passing electoral reforms related to the 2010 election . 
This is the first of several milestones in the next twelve months , including: - April 3 , 2010: Deadline for announcement of candidacy for all offices . 
State governors and members of the executive branch running for office , including cabinet members , must resign ; - June 10: Commencement of political party nominating conventions for all offices ; - July 3: Parties and candidates can start advertising on radio , television , and the internet ; - July 17: The [ORG Electoral Tribune  ] ( TSE ) will allocate radio and television advertising to parties ; - September 13: TSE must confirm the correct functioning of vote machines ; - October 3: Election Day , First Round ; - October 31: Election Day , Second Round . 
A second and final round is held when the leading candidate for a given office receives less than 50 percent of the vote in the first round . 
Only the top two candidates are eligible to compete . 
One-Year Deadline ----------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In the two weeks leading to the October 3 deadline , five senators and at least 33 federal deputies switched parties . 
The high number of party switches reflects the non-ideological nature of [MISC Brazilian  ] politics and is standard operating practice here among officials seeing greater opportunity elsewhere . 
( During an October 6 Embassy meeting with [ORG Senate Foreign Relations Committee  ] Chairman [PER Eduardo Azeredo  ] , [LOC Sao Paulo  ] Deputy [PER William Woo  ] cheerfully entered midway through and , despite having left [PER Azeredo  ] 's [ORG PSDB  ] for PPS the previous week , was well received by the Chairman . 
) The [ORG PSDB  ] , which picked up three senate seats and several deputy seats , was the biggest winner in the shuffle , while [LOC PMDB  ] and [LOC DEM  ] , the second largest opposition party , both suffered significant losses . 
Small parties fared surprisingly well , especially the opposition [ORG PSC  ] . 
[ORG House Foreign Relations Committee  ] Chairman [PER Severiano Alves  ] switched from [MISC PDT  ] to [LOC PMDB  ] ( both parties within the governing coalition ) and left [ORG Congress  ] altogether in order to prepare [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001250 002 OF 004 for a run as Vice-Governor in his home state of [LOC Bahia  ] . 
[PER Damiao Feliciano  ] , also [MISC PDT  ] and from the northeastern state of [LOC Paraiba  ] , took over October 8 as [ORG Committee Chairman.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) While most switchers are relatively obscure figures , two high-profile ministers switched parties while a presidential candidate changed residence . 
After much speculation , [ORG Central Bank  ] President [PER Henrique Meirelles  ] announced his move from non-aligned to [LOC PMDB  ] , where he is expected to run for [ORG Senate  ] from [ORG Goias  ] state , but might run instead for Governor . 
Embassy sources , including [PER Sen. Romero Juca  ] ( [MISC PMDB-RO  ] ) , have told us that [MISC Meirelles'  ] transfer confirms rumors that he is also a top-tier potential vice-presidential candidate for [PER Dilma  ] . 
( It is broadly expected that [LOC PMDB  ] will get the Vice slot on [PER Dilma  ] 's ticket , with [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] President [PER Michel Temer  ] most often named as the leading contender . 
) Foreign Minister [PER Celso Amorim  ] officially switched from [LOC PMDB  ] to [ORG PT  ] , but there are no indications at this point that he will step down to run for office in his home state of [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] . 
Finally , [PER Ciro Gomes  ] switched his residence from the northeastern state of [LOC Ceara  ] to his birth state , [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , in a move that allows him to both run for President on the [ORG PSB  ] ticket and , potentially , to switch gears to run for Governor of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] if his presidential campaign falters . 
See ref C for more on [PER Gomes  ] . 
Election Law , Internet and the Media ------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) President [PER Lula  ] also signed on September 29 the law that will define the rules for the 2010 elections . 
The more interesting changes include rules to permit campaign contributions and electioneering via the internet , to increase participation of minor candidates in television/radio debates , and to introduce absentee voting . 
Many here believe , as the chief PSDB-affiliated advisor to the [ORG Senate  ] Foreign Relations [ORG Committee  ] told poloff recently , that [ORG PT  ] is better prepared to take advantage of rule changes liberating the use of media and the internet but that his party and several others will catch up in time . 
The new legislation has been widely panned by Embassy contacts -- including some senators who voted for the law -- for actually reducing federal oversight over party campaign activities and expenditures . 
Although the deadline for electoral reform has passed , a petition drive has gathered enough signatures to authorize [ORG Congress  ] through June 5 to pass legislation to prohibit candidates convicted of crimes to run for office . 
It is unclear whether [ORG PMDB  ] leadership , which has taken the lead in opposing such legislation , will allow such a bill to pass . 
Ministerial Exodus , [ORG Congressional Paralysis  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Both [ORG Congress  ] and the ministries will be in a hurry to produce as many electoral deliverables as possible before the April 3 deadline for declaring candidacies . 
Ministers who declare are required to step down for their positions , which means that no minister has officially declared his or her candidacy at this point -- even those who are already actively campaigning . 
Media and Embassy sources suggest that over half of [PER Lula  ] 's 37-member candidate will run for office , most notably Chief-Minister [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] and [PER Meirelles  ] , but also the Ministers of [LOC Justice  ] , Energy , [ORG Social Security  ] , [ORG Education , Environment , Planning , Labor , Communications  ] , Agriculture and several others . 
It is still unclear when ministers will declare their candidacies and depart their ministries , but recent media reports indicate that [PER Dilma  ] will officially launch her presidential bid at the [ORG PT Annual Convention  ] , which takes place February 18-21 . 
In [MISC Meirelles'  ] case , Dep . 
[PER Antonio Carlos Magalhaes Neto  ] ( [ORG DEM-BA  ] ) told poloff on October 9 that [PER Meirelles  ] will not announce the office he will run for until a week before the deadline because " [PER Lula  ] needs to keep him in his current position as long as possible . 
" Other ministers , he said , will be free to announce earlier. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG Congress  ] will also be under pressure for progress before the campaign starts in earnest , particularly on the Pre-Salt oil exploration legislation , but also on a range of minor social assistance and education initiatives expected to be launched shortly . 
The governing coalition still holds a strong position in the [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] but the recent round of party switches complicates matters for [PER Lula  ] in the [ORG Senate  ] , where his coalition officially suffered a net loss of three seats but unofficially two more . 
Sen. [PER Arthur Virgilio  ] ( [ORG PSDB-AM  ] ) , the leader of his party in the [ORG Senate  ] , outlined for poloff on October 7 member-by-member how this would affect the President 's ability to pass the legislation he desires . 
[PER Virgilio  ] counted only 40 firm votes for the governing coalition on key party-line matters , and pointed out specific coalition members likely to jump ship on key issues , including [LOC Venezuela  ] 's accession to [LOC Mercosul  ] -- which he said did not currently have the votes to pass either the Foreign Relations Committee or the full [ORG Senate  ] due to worries about [PER Hugo Chavez  ] . 
[PER Virgilio  ] also emphasized that [PER Dilma  ] needs to maintain her viability in the oil-producing states of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] , and [PER Espirito Santo  ] , as do the seven senators from those states belonging to coalition parties . 
This will make it very difficult to pass Pre-Salt legislation with the distribution of royalties scheme that [PER Lula  ] and [PER Dilma  ] would prefer . 
Prospectus: President --------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Dilma  ] will need signature accomplishments in [ORG Congress  ] to raise her presidential profile to compete with [LOC Sao Paulo  ] Governor [PER Jose Serra  ] ( [ORG PSDB  ] ) , the front-runner for the Presidency . 
[PER Serra  ] is pulling 36 to 43 percent in recent polls , roughly 20 points ahead of [PER Dilma  ] , who has seen her support on the left eroded by [ORG PSB  ] candidate [PER Ciro Gomes  ] and PV candidate [PER Marina Silva  ] , both of whom are polling nearly even with [PER Dilma  ] . 
[PER Heloisa Helena  ] ( [ORG PSoL  ] ) , though barely visible in the news for months and possibly not even running , also polls around 10 percent . 
[PER Serra  ] has benefitted immensely from the negative publicity created by [ORG PT  ] 's marriage of convenience with the [ORG PMDB  ] ( ref A ) . 
Also , [PER Dilma  ] 's perceived lack of charisma makes her , in the words of Sen. [PER Azeredo  ] ( [ORG PSDB  ] ) , " the perfect opponent " for [PER Serra  ] because she is unable to take advantage of [PER Serra  ] 's own lack of personal magnetism . 
The difficulty for [PER Serra  ] , who enjoyed a similarly strong early lead when running for President in 2002 , will be to translate the support from his base to other parts of the country and to lower income brackets . 
Recent state polls indicate that [PER Serra  ] 's support tops 50 percent in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] and nearly so in the three states to the south , but falls to the 10-25 percent range everywhere else , including [LOC Rio  ] and [LOC Brasilia  ] . 
Many [ORG PSDB  ] leaders are pushing reluctant [ORG Minas Gerais  ] Governor [PER Aecio Neves  ] ( ref D & E ) , who would rather be President himself or perhaps President of the [ORG Senate  ] , to accept the vice-presidency to shore up support from his large state and potentially put an all-PSDB ticket over the top. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Observers from all sides acknowledge that , barring a major health crisis for [PER Dilma  ] or [PER Serra  ] , the " x factor " in this campaign will happen in the final weeks , when [PER Lula  ] 's undereducated base in the northeast starts to pay attention to the race . 
In a country where less than ten percent of voters belong to a political party but voting is mandatory and voter participation rates run in the high 90s , final election results do not reflect the early polls . 
The advisor to a prominent opposition parliamentarian from [LOC Pernambuco  ] told poloff that he expects [PER Serra  ] to win the first round , but expects [PER Dilma  ] to rise dramatically in the last week out of voter loyalty to [PER Lula  ] . 
In the second round , he worries , " If they add up the votes of all four of them ( [PER Dilma  ] , [PER Ciro  ] , [PER Marina  ] , [PER Helena  ] ) , they win . 
" Another opposition party advisor from the [LOC Northeast  ] told poloff to watch out for [PER Ciro  ] , whom he characterized as " the only person who can beat [PER Serra  ] , even if he doesn't win himself . 
" [PER Ciro  ] has lately been playing an attack dog role in the campaign against [PER Serra  ] , while [PER Dilma  ] and [PER Serra  ] have been reluctant to engage one another directly . 
Prospectus: Parliament and Governors ------------------------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Governor , [ORG Senate  ] , Federal Deputy , and State Deputy races in each state will be heavily influenced by the needs of the leading parties in the Presidential race . 
The key dynamic to watch will be between [ORG PMDB  ] , which wants to retain its position as the party with the most seats in all four categories , and [ORG PT  ] , which is under pressure to throw support behind [ORG PMDB  ] candidates in order to shore up support for [PER Dilma  ] 's presidential bid . 
With few candidates officially declared , it is too early to predict how these races will go , but the general consensus in [LOC Brasilia  ] is that [ORG PSDB  ] stock is rising and [ORG PMDB  ] falling at the federal level . 
The [ORG PMDB  ] already lost two senators and ten deputies in party-switching season , and legislators are increasingly confident that [ORG PMDB  ] will lose its pre-eminent position at the federal level . 
In a reference to the damage done by the recent scandal involving [ORG Senate  ] President [PER Jose Sarney  ] , Sen. [PER Virgilio  ] told poloff , " Thanks to [PER Sarney  ] , [ORG PMDB  ] is about to become a state-level party . 
" A PT-affiliated [ORG Senate  ] advisor told us much the same , but believed that [ORG PT  ] and smaller parties within the governing coalition , rather than the opposition , would gain at [ORG PMDB  ] expense . 
At the state level , [ORG PMDB  ] remains in solid position to retain or increase its governorships , with strong candidates in key states such as [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] , [ORG Minas Gerais  ] ( [ORG PSDB-held  ] ) , and [ORG Bahia  ] ( [ORG PT-held  ] ) . 
Comment: Stay Tuned ! -------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) While [LOC Brazil  ] 's 20l0 national elections appear to be moving toward a PT-PSDB presidential showdown , with [PER Serra  ] leading and [PER Dilma  ] expected to make up ground toward the end , it will be months before dependable outlines of the election environment take shape . 
The first few months of 2010 will bring focus , as candidates officially declare , state-level alliances with national implications further crystallize , and ministers depart their posts . 
The late 2009-early 2010 dynamic between [ORG Congress  ] and [PER Lula  ] , who will be in a hurry to pass legislation ranging from Pre-Salt to social program reform to Mercosul accession , may bring to the forefront policy differences in an election race that has thus far been about personalities and image . 
Even if policy issues do not grow in importance , the debates will indicate how the two major coalitions , if elected , could address issues of interest to the [LOC United States  ] .
