[PER Nyanda  ] , who himself purchased vehicles totaling several thousand dollars , the most spent by anyone in the [ORG Cabinet  ] , said it was absurd for [ORG Cosatu  ] to suggest that the [ORG Ministers  ] should return the official vehicles because vehicles are needed to deliver on their mandate and meet the expectations of the public . 
It is , however , the expenditure incurred by [PER Blade Nzimande  ] , Minister of Higher Education and Training and leader of the [MISC South African  ] [ORG Communist Party  ] ( [ORG SACP  ] ) that has caused the most strident public backlash .

( U ) [MISC Comment:  ] The global economic recession has unleashed a reappraisal of the role of state spending in the [MISC South African  ] economy and the [PER Zuma  ] administration should be on the cutting edge of defining this role for [LOC South Africa  ] . 
Zuma’s government has failed to do this and , despite winning an overwhelming majority in the April general election , is currently faced with a credibility problem as on the one hand it advocates serving the needs of the poor and encourages all [MISC South Africans  ] to tighten their belts during the current economic crisis , while on the other it is allowing excessive spending of public money on personal luxuries . 
In order to restore public confidence in the government , there needs to be a marked improvement in service delivery and an eradication of entitlement and inefficiency . 
Effective management of government is a priority . 
This also applies to the curtailment of corruption and overspending which is sapping state coffers and inhibiting the delivery of basic services . 
However , there needs to be a political will to combat corruption and self enrichment , as any failures to do so weaken the government’s authority to combat corruption and excessive spending at lower levels in government . 
Local municipal elections are due to be held in 2010 with many constituencies expected to be closely contested . 
Opposition parties have already expressed the possibility of an alliance to contest the local elections and the [ORG ANC  ] could find itself in a precarious position should its legitimacy be weakened . 
[LOC South Africa  ] is believed to have one of the highest per capita rates of protest action in the world , and [MISC South Africans  ] are openly critical of a government most of them vote for at the polls . 
Politically , the “cargate” scandal has the ability to weaken the [PER Zuma  ] government and increase protests , as a loss of credibility has the potential to create a climate for instability , unrest and [LOC CAPE TOWN  ] 00000204 002 OF 002 <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 .
