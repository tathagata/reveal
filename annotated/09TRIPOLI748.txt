Cretz  ] , Ambassador , [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [LOC Tripoli  ] , [ORG Department of State  ] . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: An interagency team led by Acting A/S for [ORG DRL Karen Stewart  ] , and comprised of [ORG State  ] , [ORG NSC  ] , and [ORG OVP  ] representatives , launched with [MISC Libyan  ] counterparts a bilateral [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] August 18 in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
Although a bizarre , last-minute [MISC Libyan  ] delegation and agenda switch nearly scuttled the talks , FM [PER Musa Kusa  ] intervened to restore the original delegation and agenda , and personally launched the talks . 
In his opening remarks , [PER Kusa  ] acknowledged the [ORG GOL  ] 's need for [LOC U.S.  ] technical assistance in a range of areas , including illegal immigration and upgrading the capacity of [LOC Libya  ] 's detention centers and prisons . 
[PER Kusa  ] and other [ORG GOL  ] officials protested the critical comments about [LOC Libya  ] contained within the annual [ORG Human Rights Report  ] and noted their interest in setting the record straight on [LOC Libya  ] 's human rights situation within the context of the [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] . 
[PER Kusa  ] stressed that the [ORG GOL  ] viewed the human rights dialogue as part of a larger group of bilateral dialogues with the [LOC United States  ] on a number of topics , including security , civil-nuclear cooperation , and political-military engagement ; his emphasis on this point , coupled with last-minute [MISC Libyan  ] changes to the joint statement ( which resulted in agreement for no statement ) hinted at a deal struck with hardliners to put the talks back on track only if they had a broader -- or no -- public focus . 
While we will not know how serious the [MISC Libyans  ] are about these talks until we receive their feedback on the action plans in mid-October , we are hopeful that they could lead to some positive engagement in the areas of immigration , refugee issues , and prison conditions . 
End Summary . 
2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC U.S.  ] delegation included Acting A/S for [ORG DRL Karen Stewart  ] ; [LOC Scott Busby  ] , Director for [ORG Human Rights , National Security Council  ] ; [ORG Herro Mustafa  ] , [ORG Senior Advisor  ] for the [LOC Middle East  ] and [MISC South Asia  ] , [ORG Office of the Vice  ] President ; [PER Robert K.

The [MISC Libyan  ] delegation that initiated the dialogue was led by FM [PER Kusa  ] and included [PER Abdussalam  ] al-Tumi , Chairman of the [ORG Human Rights Commission  ] at the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] ; [PER Dr. Mohamed Salah  ] al-Saghir , [PER Head  ] of the [ORG Department of International Law and Agreements  ] at the [ORG MFA  ] ; [PER Murad Hamim  ] from the [ORG MFA  ] 's [ORG International Organizations Department  ] ; [PER Hamid Ahmed Hdhiri  ] , [ORG National Security Council  ] ; [PER Abulqacem Gargum  ] , [PER Head  ] of [ORG Judicial Police Service  ] ; [PER Dr. Ramadhan Abdedayem  ] , [PER Head  ] of the [ORG Department of Human Rights  ] at the General People 's [ORG Congress  ] ; [PER Nasreddine Ageeli  ] , [ORG MFA Legal Consultant  ] on [ORG Human Rights  ] ; [PER Mohamed  ] el-Mahdi [PER Hajaji  ] , Secretary of the [ORG Department of Associations and Non-governmental Activities  ] at the [ORG Ministry of Social Affairs  ] ; [ORG Brigadier Abdelmonem Ettunsi  ] , Director of the [ORG Illegal Immigration Office  ] at the [ORG Ministry of Public Security  ] ; and [PER Dr. Ibrahim  ] Abu [PER Khzam  ] of [ORG Al Fatah University  ] .

] DIALOGUE BEGINS WITH A FALSE START 3 . 
( C ) The [LOC U.S.  ] interagency team led by Acting A/S for [ORG DRL Karen Stewart  ] met with [MISC Libyan  ] officials at 1030 local time August 18 at the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] in [LOC Tripoli  ] to initiate a bilateral [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] . 
While the [MISC Libyan  ] side initially responded positively to the concept of the dialogue and provided on August 17 a list of participants and an agenda that paralleled our proposed agenda , the actual [ORG GOL  ] team for the morning session was led by a philosophy professor , a judge , and the Foreign Minister 's interpreter , none of whom was included among the original delegation . 
[ Note: The [ORG GOL  ] told us originally that their delegation would be led by the Justice Minister but told us August 17 that the A/S-equivalent for consular issues would be the lead . 
End Note . 
] 4 . 
( C ) After introducing himself as " a professor , not a politician , " noting that " politics is the art of tricks , " philosophy professor [PER Rajab Boudabbous  ] attempted to open the bilateral [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] with a lecture on human rights and the [MISC Libyan  ] concept of democracy -- direct rule by the people or " jamahiriya . 
" The [LOC U.S.  ] delegation interrupted [MISC Boudabbous'  ] lecture , halted the talks , and sought information about the [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000748 002.2 OF 005 whereabouts of the named [ORG GOL  ] delegation . 
[PER Boudabbous  ] refused to clarify what had happened and continued with his lecture as if he had been uninterrupted . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] team withdrew from the lecture , and taking a few moments to regroup , the [ORG Charge  ] discussed the situation with [ORG MFA  ] Director of the [ORG Americas Office  ] , [PER Mohamed Matari  ] . 
[ Note: [ORG Charge  ] attempted to contact A/S-equivalent for the [ORG Americas Department Ahmed Fituri  ] , who did not answer his phone throughout the morning . 
End note . 
] [PER Matari  ] told the [ORG Charge  ] that he would inform Foreign Minister [PER Musa Kusa  ] of the [LOC U.S.  ] side 's objections to the delegation and format of the dialogue . 
[ORG Charge  ] conveyed the importance of the initiation of the dialogue , as previously agreed , to the bilateral relationship and future engagement , including at the upcoming [ORG UN General Assembly  ] session . 
5 . 
( C ) As the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation was in the process of departing the [ORG MFA  ] , FM [PER Kusa  ] arrived but deliberately ignored the [ORG Charge  ] 's attempt to discuss the issue with him . 
Shortly thereafter , [PER Matari  ] called to inform the [ORG Charge  ] that FM [PER Kusa  ] would lead the dialogue himself at 1830 hours and that he would like to host a dinner for the team at 2100 hours , as previously scheduled . 
[PER Kusa  ] 's staff later revised the schedule to begin at 1730 local time , " to ensure sufficient time for substantive discussions . 
" TAKE TWO: THE DIALOGUE FINALLY COMMENCES 6 . 
( C ) At 1730 local time , the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation met an appropriate [ORG GOL  ] interagency team , led by the Foreign Minister , at [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] . 
[PER Kusa  ] opened the meeting by stressing the need for bilateral dialogue . 
He noted that he had heard about the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation 's response to the professor 's viewpoint during the morning meeting , calling it an example of the " bad chemistry " that had plagued the relationship . 
[PER Kusa  ] portrayed the [MISC Libyan  ] government as ready to continue a results-driven human rights dialogue based on mutual respect . 
He acknowledged that the [ORG GOL  ] needs [LOC U.S.  ] assistance to improve the human rights situation . 
Specifically , [PER Kusa  ] requested [LOC U.S.  ] assistance to combat illegal immigration and trafficking-in-persons , to upgrade and build capacity in [MISC Libyan  ] prisons , and to train police . 
[PER Kusa  ] said that he had requested EU assistance to tackle the illegal immigration problem , specifying that in a country of six million people , [LOC Libya  ] had three million immigrants , most of whom were illegal . 
However , he said that the [MISC European  ] governments did not agree to assist in combating the problem . 
With borders 6,000 km long , mostly along the desert , and poor neighboring countries , [LOC Libya  ] " can do nothing " according to [PER Kusa  ] , to combat illegal immigration unilaterally . 
He described a dire situation in [LOC Libya  ] , with increasing crime , disease , and other problems , as the result of illegal immigration . 
He said that one human rights organization ( not specifying which one ) had brought to his attention the existence of a trafficking-in-persons problem in [LOC Libya  ] , which [PER Kusa  ] noted could only be identified and combated with foreign assistance . 
7 . 
( C ) [PER Kusa  ] further noted that [LOC Libya  ] needed to take advantage of [LOC U.S.  ] experience to upgrade [LOC Libya  ] 's prisons and detention facilities . 
He said [LOC Libya  ] needed training for police officers and wardens on how to deal with prisoners in a way that respects their human rights . 
Referring to a [LOC UK  ] project to upgrade [MISC Libyan  ] prisons and train police officers , [PER Kusa  ] explained that the [LOC UK  ] had sent experts to work on the issue areas he specified but that [LOC Libya  ] needed even more assistance than what the [LOC UK  ] was able to provide . 
8 . 
( C ) [PER Kusa  ] went on to discuss the method for evaluating human rights issues on both sides . 
He asked that the annual [ORG State Department Human Rights Report  ] be a subject of discussion within the framework of the dialogue . 
[PER Kusa  ] referred to " fallacies " in the 2008 [ORG Human Rights Report  ] on [LOC Libya  ] , specifically recalling a section on the rights of women and the existence of political prisoners . 
On the first issue , he pointed to various facts proving that women are empowered in [LOC Libya  ] - " at least 150 women work in the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] . 
" Regarding political prisoners , he insisted that the " political prisoners " to which the report referred were actually fundamentalists with links to [ORG Al Qaeda  ] , whom the [ORG GOL  ] was trying to rehabilitate . 
He explained that the [MISC Libyan  ] government was " stretching its hands " and " opening its heart " to dialogue and discussion for the sake of transparency and to correct the wrong information that the [ORG USG  ] was reporting on the human rights situation in [LOC Libya  ] . 
9 . 
( C ) Acting [PER A/S Stewart  ] thanked [PER Kusa  ] for taking a personal interest in launching the dialogue , noting that the dialogue would be integral to broader bilateral efforts to expand [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000748 003.2 OF 005 cooperation across several spheres , including political-military , economic , education , and culture . 
She noted that the [ORG USG  ] was engaged in human rights dialogues with many countries throughout the world , as the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] and [MISC American  ] people expect , and that the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation would welcome the opportunity to address [LOC Libya  ] 's needs for technical assistance in the areas outlined by [PER Kusa  ] . 
She explained that the human rights dialogue could be a model for engagement in other subject areas . 
[ORG NEA/MAG Office  ] Director [PER Maggie Nardi  ] suggested that issue-specific working groups be designated to tackle each issue . 
[PER Kusa  ] expressed his agreement with the suggestions and emphasized the need for direct political dialogue in order to address " significant issues . 
" He highlighted positive bilateral coordination on Darfur with USSES Gration , as well as the security and military engagement , which [PER CODEL McCain  ] had recently discussed with [MISC Muatassim  ] and [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] ( reftel ) . 
[PER Kusa  ] went on to discuss his interest in broadening the framework for [MISC U.S.-Libyan  ] relations in a number of areas , including combating fundamentalism . 
Acting [PER A/S Stewart  ] outlined our proposed framework for the dialogue with twice yearly senior-level meetings and working groups to advance progress in the interim on priority topics , including joint polices and projects involving multilateral institutions , prison conditions and management , migration and refugees , and specific human rights cases as they arise . 
FM [PER Kusa  ] declared his agreement with this general framework and asked the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation to propose a work plan and timetable for discussing agenda items and actively addressing them . 
[MISC LIBYAN  ] DELEGATION ADDRESSES ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION , PRISONS , [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT  ] 10 . 
( C ) Turning the floor to his delegation , [PER Kusa  ] said that a group of specialists had been gathered on the [MISC Libyan  ] side for the purpose of the dialogue . 
Stating " I do not even know all of their names , " [PER Kusa  ] introduced the delegates he recognized and excused himself from the meeting . 
During the remaining two hours of discussion , the [MISC Libyan  ] delegates would not admit their government needed assistance in the areas outlined by [PER Musa Kusa  ] -- illegal immigration , trafficking in persons , prison upgrades , or police training . 
Instead they parsed terms and argued over definitions . 
Arguing that [MISC Libyan  ] society and culture is misunderstood by the [ORG USG  ] , [PER Abdussalam  ] el-Tumi , Chairman of the [ORG Human Rights Commission  ] at the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] , maintained that neither " prisoners " nor " prisons " existed in [LOC Libya  ] ; rather , [LOC Libya  ] has " detention facilities " designed to rehabilitate those " sons and brothers " who have gone astray . 
[PER Tumi  ] described a [MISC Libya-UK  ] prison program by which the [LOC UK  ] provides technical assistance and training to [MISC Libyan  ] police officers and prison guards . 
He said that [LOC UK  ] representatives had visited [LOC Libya  ] 's criminal detention facilities , photographed , and reported that detainees were treated in accordance with international human rights conventions . 
[PER Tumi  ] described the judicial process by which detainees are tried and sentenced , laws stipulating detainee rights , and the treatment of detainees in detention centers . 
[PER Tumi  ] eventually admitted that the [ORG GOL  ] required assistance in the care of detainees -- specifically in the provision of medical care , vocational training , and social reintegration programs -- as well as in training police officers and upgrading and building capacity of prison facilities . 
11 . 
( C ) [PER Tumi  ] asserted that trafficking-in-persons did not exist in [LOC Libya  ] . 
Regarding the [ORG Human Rights Report  ] , [PER Tumi  ] charged that it was not based on facts , was distanced from reality , and contained sections that were " laughable . 
" He said that the [MISC Libyan  ] government responded to individual charges of human rights abuse and that the issue areas outlined by [PER Kusa  ] - involving women 's empowerment and female circumcision - were misconceived . 
He insisted that " human rights as a complete concept " does not exist anywhere in the world , and he expressed his hope that the dialogue would continue in order to eliminate all misunderstandings regarding the human rights situation of each nation . 
12 . 
( C ) Dr. [PER Mohamed Salah  ] al-Saghir , Head of the [ORG Department of International Law and Agreements  ] at the [ORG MFA  ] , also expressed his support for the dialogue and highlighted the international conventions and agreements to which [LOC Libya  ] was a party . 
As [LOC Libya  ] was a party to the [ORG Convention  ] on the Elimination of all Forms of [MISC Discrimination Against Women  ] ( [ORG CEDAW  ] ) , [PER Saghir  ] said that the [ORG Human Rights Report  ] must be wrong in its assertion that women in [LOC Libya  ] face discrimination . 
He insisted that international conventions have supremacy over local law and are embodied within local laws as soon as the [ORG GOL  ] signs them . 
[LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000748 004.2 OF 005 13 . 
( C ) [PER AA/S Stewart  ] assured the [MISC Libyan  ] team that the [MISC Embassy  ] would work with them to discuss their objections to the [ORG Human Rights Report  ] over the next few months . 
[ORG NSC  ] representative [PER Scott Busby  ] encouraged the [ORG GOL  ] to become party to the 1951 [ORG UN Refugee Convention  ] and its 1967 [ORG Protocol  ] and to sign a Memorandum of Agreement with the [ORG UN High Commission  ] on Refugees as important steps to address [LOC Libya  ] 's illegal immigration problem . 
[PER Busby  ] outlined areas where the [LOC U.S.  ] might be able to provide assistance if [LOC Libya  ] would provide assurance that it was complying with the international treaties and conventions it had signed involving refugees . 
[PER Murad Hamim  ] from [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG International Organizations Department  ] at the [ORG MFA  ] responded that the [ORG GOL  ] did not need to sign the 1951 [ORG Convention  ] , as it was already a party to the 1969 [ORG Organization of African Union  ] ( [ORG OAU  ] ) [ORG Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa  ] , which embodies many of the same principles as the 1951 and 1967 [ORG Convention  ] and [ORG Protocol  ] . 
He noted the [ORG GOL  ] 's surprise that the [ORG USG  ] is not a party to the [ORG Convention  ] on the Protection of the Rights of All [ORG Migrant Workers and Members  ] of their Families . 
Briefly addressing the issue of prisons , [PER Harris  ] noted that the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Libya  ] both had responsibilities under the [ORG International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  ] and other treaties to provide proper treatment for persons under detention and that the [LOC United States  ] looked forward to working with [LOC Libya  ] in the context of the [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] to share our experiences in efficient and humane management of detention facilities . 
In the time before the next meeting we looked forward to discussing next steps for progress and cooperation on this issue . 
14 . 
( C ) [PER Hamid Ahmed Hdhiri  ] of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG NSC  ] noted that the problem of illegal immigration flows into [LOC Libya  ] require dramatic solutions to the root causes of the problem -- solutions that go beyond security . 
He called for [LOC U.S.  ] assistance to combat the flow of illegal immigration from both security and economic perspectives . 
[PER Hdhiri  ] recognized the value of the 1951 and 1967 [ORG UN Refugee Conventions  ] , but he expressed [LOC Libya  ] 's concern that the treaty could inflict harm on the country by encouraging additional immigrants to flow across the borders . 
He characterized [LOC Libya  ] as a transit , rather than a source country , for illegal immigrants and called it a " burden " to the nation . 
He said that [LOC Libya  ] was providing a humanitarian service by accepting protective responsibility for illegal immigrants who had been returned from [MISC European  ] sea ports . 
[PER Hdhiri  ] noted that [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] had suggested that an international conference convene to address the root causes of immigration from [LOC Sub-Saharan Africa  ] , namely poverty and lack of opportunities for economic development . 
15 . 
( C ) Finally , the [MISC Libyan  ] delegation asserted that civil society does not exist in [LOC Libya  ] because it is unnecessary . 
Representatives justified their statements by claiming that [LOC Libya  ] is a homogenous , unified society in which one group does not dominate the other , and described civil society organizations as designed solely to address the needs of groups which are disadvantaged or discriminated against within a society . 
In response to the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation 's concern about the registration process for [MISC NGOs  ] , one delegate explained that individuals could form issue-focused " charity groups " to address specific " causes , " such as anti-smoking or environmental awareness campaigns . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] delegation tried to explain that " charity groups " might count as " civil society " if only they were unrelated to the government ( although currently no charity group can be formed outside of the umbrella of a quasi-governmental organization ) and that contacts with similar groups in the [LOC United States  ] and elsewhere would represent the kind of international communication and links we hope other civil society groups could enjoy , but the [MISC Libyan  ] side did not appear to grasp our understanding of civil society . 
16 . 
( C ) Both sides ended the discussion by agreeing that the [LOC U.S.  ] would develop work plans on the agenda items and timelines for addressing them . 
They agreed that the next session of the dialogue would take place after six months and that the [LOC U.S.  ] side would host . 
Although both sides had agreed before the dialogue began to the wording for a joint press statement announcing that the dialogue had been launched , the [MISC Libyan  ] side changed the wording at the last minute to inaccurately describe the discussions as covering also security , military issues , and political issues and downplaying the human rights focus , and was unable to compromise with the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation on a mutually-acceptable statement . 
Likewise the [MISC Libyan  ] side reneged on a commitment to state publicly that the dialogue had been initiated , without explanation of its reasoning . 
Immediately after the meeting , the [MISC Libyan  ] side hosted a dinner for the [LOC U.S.  ] [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000748 005.2 OF 005 delegation , during which substantive issues were not formally discussed . 
[PER Musa Kusa  ] was unable to attend , although two members of the original delegation identified by the [ORG GOL  ] , Dr. [PER Ali al-Rishi  ] , the Secretary of Immigration and [ORG Expatriate Affairs  ] at the [ORG MFA  ] , and [PER Mohamed Matari  ] , Director of the [ORG Department of American Affairs  ] at the [ORG MFA  ] , as well as [MISC Libyan  ] A/S-equivalent for the [ORG Americas  ] [PER Ahmed Fituri  ] , did . 
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED ? 17 . 
( C ) On the margins of the dinner , [PER Fituri  ] told us that he had been called to a meeting at 0200 local time the same day , to discuss the [ORG Human Rights Dialogue.  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx The [ORG GOL  ] 's last-minute change to the proposed joint statement -- portraying the talks as more general in nature and focused on security and military issues as well as political issues -- likely was the deal struck by FM [PER Kusa  ] to get the talks back on track after our delegation walked out of the morning session . 
The [ORG GOL  ] 's readiness to drop the statement on the condition that both sides keep the talks quiet seems to indicate that [PER Kusa  ] and more [MISC Western-leaning  ] officials needed to mollify hardliners who were concerned about the public perception of the talks . 
The [ORG GOL  ] has kept its word and never publicized any aspect of the talks , although they had plenty of footage and still pictures from the meeting . 
18 . 
( C ) Comment: In spite of the bizarre , fitful start , FM [PER Kusa  ] made it clear that he personally values the dialogue . 
His direct , personal involvement will be essential to the dialogue 's successful continuation . 
And while the substance of the dialogue may have exposed some very wide gaps in our two countries' understanding of some key human rights concepts , it also revealed some common ground and seemingly genuine desire for engagement , particularly in the areas of refugees and migration , and prison conditions . 
We look forward to working with the interagency and the [ORG GOL  ] to develop work plans and timelines for meaningful action on the agenda items . 
End Comment . 
NEXT STEPS 19 . 
( SBU ) As agreed with the [MISC Libyan  ] delegation , State DRL will take the lead to draft and clear work plans and suggested action timelines for each of the specific human rights areas identified during the talks for submission to the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG MFA  ] by mid-October .
