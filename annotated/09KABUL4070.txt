<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 05 [LOC KABUL  ] 004070 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 12/19/2019 TAGS PGOV , PREL , AF SUBJECT: THE NEW CABINET: BETTER BUT NOT BEST Classified By: Ambassador Ricciardone reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: President [PER Karzai  ] sent most of the cabinet list to the [ORG Parliament  ] on December 19 with the notable exception of [ORG National Directorate for Security  ] ( [ORG NDS  ] ) Chief [PER Saleh  ] . 
Although we judge many of the ministers are acceptable and qualified , this list represents only a modest upgrade in [MISC Karzai’s  ] cabinet talent . 
It appears [PER Karzai  ] chose ministers based on compromises between the wishes of the international community and the traditional powerbrokers to whom he is beholden to , including [PER Dostum  ] , [PER Mohaqqeq  ] , [PER Ismail Khan  ] , [PER Fahim Khan  ] , [PER Khalili  ] and [PER Sayyaf  ] . 
Despite the promises to former President ( and [PER Abdullah  ] backer ) [PER Rabbani  ] , [PER Karzai  ] gave him no positions - increasing the possibility of a more powerful opposition . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 .

REMAINING: --Defense - Gen. [PER Abdul Rahim Wardak  ] ( [PER Pashtun  ] ) . 
He was a mujahadeen commander during the [MISC Soviet  ] occupation , and later spent over two decades in the [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC D.C.  ] area . 
He has political connections to Pir [PER Sayed Ahmad Gailani  ] . 
Although some say his family has profited from defense contracts , he is considered competent and cooperative with [LOC U.S.  ] interests. --Interior - [PER Mohammad Hanif Atmar  ] ( [PER Pashtun  ] ) . 
He earned his [MISC Master’s  ] degree in [LOC International Relations  ] and [ORG Post-war Development  ] from [ORG York University  ] in the [LOC UK  ] . 
He is allegedly a [MISC British  ] citizen , and may renounce his citizenship if pressed by the [ORG Parliament  ] . 
He was a loyalist to the [MISC Soviet  ] Union-backed government , and his leg was severely injured in an anti-government mujahadeen attack . 
Many Karzai-supporters do not trust him , particularly the former [ORG Northern Alliance  ] . 
He maintains some political connections with former Interior Minister [PER Jalali  ] and [PER Ashraf Ghani  ] . 
[PER Karzai  ] told us in early December that “Atmar was hanging on by a thread” because many powerful former mujahadeen like [PER Sayyaf  ] and [PER Ismail Khan  ] did not trust him . 
The [MISC British  ] joined us in supporting him . 
He is one of the intellectual stars of the cabinet. --Finance - [PER Mohammad Omer Zakhiwal  ] ( [PER Pashtun  ] ) . 
He has [MISC Canadian  ] citizenship , and most think he is willing to renounce his citizenship if the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Parliament  ] insists . 
He is associated with [MISC Hezb-e-Islami  ] , although not the [LOC KABUL  ] 00004070 002 OF 005 Arghandewal branch . 
He is close to President [PER Karzai  ] and raised funds for him during the campaign , at times using methods that are not illegal here but not in concert with [MISC Western  ] standards . 
We consider him a skilled technocrat who effectively promotes the economic development of [LOC Afghanistan  ] ; he is the closest of the “technocrats” to [PER Karzai.  ] --Communication - Engineer [PER Amirzai Sangin  ] ( [PER Pashtun  ] ) . 
He earned his [MISC Bachelor’s  ] degree in [LOC Electronics  ] and Communications from the [ORG Southern London University  ] .

He has a well-deserved reputation for competence. --Justice - [PER Sarwar Danish  ] ( [ORG Hazara  ] ) . 
He is a prolific writer and has published fifteen books on [MISC Islamic  ] Jurisprudence , and other legal issues . 
He is from [LOC Daikundi Province  ] , and was born into a pious and religious family .

We have found him approachable , competent , and relatively dedicated to rule of law and human rights. --Education - [PER Ghulam Farooq Wardak  ] ( [PER Pashtun  ] ) . 
We consider him an effective minister . 
However , the press reported widely that he misused his public office and power over schools to support [PER Karzai  ] in the 2009 presidential elections . 
He is beholden to the [ORG Hezb-e-Islami Afghanistan  ] party led by Arghandewal , although he claims he no longer is affiliated . 
He is close to the President and has been an insightful interlocutor on politics. --Water and Energy - Al-Haj [PER Mohammad Ismail Khan  ] ( [MISC Tajik  ] ) . 
This former warlord is known for his corruption and ineffectiveness at the Energy Ministry ; the worst of [MISC Karzai’s  ] choices . 
Presidential Chief of Staff [PER Omer Daudzai  ] told us December 17 that a strong deputy minister would be appointed and he gave us the CV of a western-trained candidate who will manage the ministry . 
He said some of the water responsibilities could be transferred to Agriculture as another “work around.” The establishment of a national power company had already taken away some responsibilities from this position . 
Our repeated interventions directly with [PER Karzai  ] and his supporters , including a last-minute intervention via [PER Mojaddedi  ] , did not overcome [MISC Karzai’s  ] deeply personal bonds with [PER Khan  ] . 
Others think [PER Khan  ] is a signal to the former jihadis that [PER Karzai  ] still stands by them , despite international pressure. --Women’s Affairs - [ORG Hosun Bano Ghazanfar  ] ( [MISC Uzbek  ] ) . 
She was supported by the primarily [MISC Uzbek  ] [ORG Junbesh  ] political party , although they admitted that they did not think she should “count” against their promised four positions . 
Her performance has disappointed us and female political leaders . 
Her wealthy and influential family lends her political strength ; they own the [ORG Ghazanfar Bank  ] , import oil from [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Uzbekistan  ] and [LOC Iran  ] , and reportedly gave large contributions to [MISC Karzai’s  ] campaign .

He received degrees from the [ORG American University of Beirut  ] , and later a doctorate in political science from [ORG Northwestern University  ] .

He is currently the deputy in this ministry , and is associated with [PER Marshall Fahim  ] . 
[PER Daudzai  ] complained about this choice , noting that [PER Barmak  ] was [PER Panjshiri  ] , but he gets high marks for his management of the [ORG National Solidarity Program.  ] --Labor and [ORG Social Affairs  ] - [PER Mohammad Ismail Munshi  ] ( [MISC Turkmen  ] ) . 
He is one of the Deputy Chairmen of the [ORG Junbesh  ] party .

His nomination was supported by [PER Fahim Khan.  ] ------------- NOT ANNOUNCED ------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) President [PER Karzai  ] has made no announcement about his advisors , his Chief of Staff , the Foreign Affairs Minister , [PER NDS  ] , the [ORG OAA  ] , the [ORG Independent Directorate for Local Governance  ] ( [ORG IDLG  ] ) , the [ORG National Security Advisor  ] , and the Minister for [ORG Urban Development  ] . 
Presidential Chief of Staff [PER Omer Daudzai  ] told Deputy Ambassador Ricciardone on December 17 that FM [PER Spanta  ] would stay on until after the January 28 [LOC London  ] conference ; he implied that the current [ORG NSA  ] Rassoul will likely take his place . 
[PER Spanta  ] would have a difficult time obtaining Parliamentary approval due to his dual ( [MISC German  ] ) citizenship , his name on the list of corrupt officials given to the [ORG Parliament  ] by the Deputy Attorney General on December 16 , and because [PER Spanta  ] received a vote of no confidence in the [ORG Parliament  ] in the past . 
[ORG NSA  ] and [ORG IDLG  ] were not announced today because those positions do not require Parliament’s approval . 
[PER Daudzai  ] said the [ORG IDLG Ministry  ] would remain with [PER Jelani Popal  ] ( [PER Pashtun  ] ) , who is considered to be a technocrat. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) It was unusual that [PER NDS Saleh  ] was not announced with the others , as both [PER Karzai  ] and his Chief of Staff have told us on numerous occasions that he would stay on . 
At one point , [PER Sayyaf  ] was reportedly applying significant pressure on [PER Karzai  ] to give the job to the previous Border and Tribal Affairs Minister [PER Assadullah Khalid  ] , who is exceptionally corrupt and incompetent . 
[PER Karzai  ] told Ambassador [PER Eikenberry  ] that a new [ORG Construction Ministry  ] ( taking functions from [ORG Urban Development  ] and [ORG Public Works  ] ) would be created and given to the current Governor of [ORG Nangarhar Gul  ] [PER Aqa Sherzai  ] . 
[PER Sherzai  ] has indicated separately to us that he plans to stay on as governor , which may be why the [ORG Urban Development  ] Minister was left off the list . 
( [PER Daudzai  ] told us [PER Yusuf Pashtun  ] , a former [ORG Urban Development  ] Minister , will become the next Minister of [ORG Urban Development  ] . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG Parliament  ] debated extensively whether or not President [PER Karzai  ] had the right to divide , add , or change Ministries without their approval . 
[ORG Lower House  ] Speaker [PER Yunus Qanooni  ] and former presidential candidate Bashardost noted in the plenary on December 19 that the approval of one-third of the [ORG Parliament  ] was required to reorganize ministerial functions according to the constitution , although after he received a call from the Presidential Palace during the plenary [PER Qanooni  ] said splitting ministries was acceptable . 
Taj [PER Ali Saber  ] , [PER Karzai’s  ] nomination for the new [ORG Ministry of Martyrs and Disabled  ] , was not allowed to be presented to the [ORG Parliament  ] for this reason ( this used to be part of the Labor and [ORG Social Affairs Ministry  ] ) . -------------------------------------- [ORG Analysis: Political Debts and Balance  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Of the selections announced to date , 13 of the 24 are holdovers . 
Former President [PER Rabbani  ] was engaged in intensive negotiations with [PER Karzai  ] for weeks but got none of his supporters a ministry - which may lead to a stronger opposition if he rejoins Abdullah’s movement . 
One [ORG UNAMA  ] analyst noted that [MISC Rabbani’s  ] faction had tried hardest for the two security ministries ( Defense and Interior ) but that [PER Karzai  ] had shown “strength” in keeping the two ministers in place . 
[PER Karzai  ] did not feel himself bound to a “coalition” or powersharing arrangement with [PER Rabbani  ] , who clearly overshot in his post-election negotiations. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The biggest initial winners include first Vice President [PER Fahim  ] , who delivered significant numbers of [MISC Tajik  ] voters and according to our estimates received five seats for his supporters . 
[PER Dostum  ] , whose [MISC Uzbek  ] supporters pushed [PER Karzai’s  ] victory , comes in second with three positions . 
Other winners include [PER Mohaqqeq  ] ( [PER Karzai  ] split the [LOC Hazara  ] vote with Bashardost ) with two ; the prestigious [PER Gailani  ] family - 2.5 ( [PER Ahadi  ] , [PER Hamed Gailani’s  ] brother in law , is “half [PER Gailani  ] , half [MISC Afghan  ] Millat” ) ; [MISC Afghan  ] Millat - 1.5 ; [PER Khalili  ] - 1 ; [PER Ismail Khan  ] - 1 ; [PER Mojaddedi  ] - .5 ( Fatimie is considered “half [PER Mojaddedi  ] , half the former [PER King Shah  ] family” ) ; [PER Shah Family  ] - 1.5 ; Hezb-e-Islami - 2 ; and [PER Sayyaf  ] - 1 . 
Atmar , [PER Rahimi  ] , [PER Shahrani  ] and Khodaidad were not considered to be any particular groups’ candidate , although all receive some international support .
