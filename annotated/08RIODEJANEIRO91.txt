( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary . 
[ORG Brazil National Petroleum Agency  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) Director [PER Haroldo Lima  ] is under fire and , some speculate , may lose his job for confirming what petroleum industry insiders have believed for some time -- that , at a depth of around 4000 meters in the [LOC Santos Basin  ] off the coast of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] potentially has a mega oil field estimated to contain between 30-40 billion barrels of oil . 
If these reserves are confirmed , [LOC Brazil  ] could jump into the top 10 oil countries by reserves , surpassing nations such as [LOC Nigeria  ] and [LOC Libya  ] . 
Though the possibilities have generated a great deal of excitement , industry observers caution that the technological challenges involved are extensive and expensive to overcome , meaning that any developments will , at the very least , be slow in coming . 
In light of the potential gains , there are signs that GOB is looking for ways to maximize the government share of these historic finds and to allow [ORG Petrobras  ] to position itself to be the leading developer in the new fields . 
End Summary . 
Making News and Moving the Markets ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Speaking as part of a seminar panel on April 14 , [ORG ANP  ] Director [PER Haroldo Lima  ] announced that [MISC Brazilian  ] state oil company [ORG Petrobras  ] is sitting on the world 's biggest oil discovery in 30 years . 
[ORG ANP  ] quickly released a statement distancing itself from [PER Lima  ] 's remarks , saying that he had been speaking outside of his official capacity . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] semi-publi c state oil company [ORG Petrobras  ] declined to confirm the estimate , saying only that studies on the find are still underway . 
Still , shares of [ORG Petrobras  ] closed up 6 percent on the day. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) According to [PER Lima  ] , [ORG Petrobras  ] , which operates the [MISC BM-S-9  ] block ( " [PER Carioca  ] " ) , has a significant stake in a massive sub-salt structure that could contain more than 33 billion barrels of oil equivalent and is estimated to be five times the size of the recently announced , large [MISC Tupi  ] discovery ( 5-8 billion barrels ) ( ref B ) . 
He went on to comment that [PER Carioca  ] has the potential to be the third biggest active field in the world . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Securities and Exchange Commission  ] harshly criticized [PER Lima  ] , saying that he should have known the effect his comments would have on the stock market . 
In the near-term , [ORG ANP  ] and [PER Lima  ] will focus their energies on damage control but [PER Lima  ] could very well be fired over this slip-up within the next few days. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [PER Lima  ] , 67 , is an electrical engineer from the state of [LOC Bahia  ] . 
B efore being named Director of [ORG ANP  ] in 2005 , [PER Lima  ] was a five-term federal deputy in the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congress  ] . 
He is a member of [ORG Communist Party of Brazil  ] ( [ORG PCdoB  ] ) , which supports the [ORG Lula Administration  ] . 
Though [PER Lima  ] did not come to [ORG ANP  ] with a strong background in petroleum , industry generally gives a positive assessment of his performance as Director . 
Under [PER Lima  ] , [ORG ANP  ] has held four bidding rounds for oil and natural gas exploration and production blocks . 
[PER Lima  ] understands that regular and transparent bidding rounds are fundamental to maintaining international investment in the petroleum and gas industry . 
In a recent interview in [LOC ISTOE Magazine  ] , [PER Lima  ] called for the creation of a 100% state-owned company to receive all the oil extracted from [LOC Brazil  ] and partners would receive monetary payments . 
How Much Oil Are We Talking About ? ----------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) For years , industry insiders have conjectured that there might be a lot more oil at deeper geological intervals t han those where [ORG Petrobras  ] , [ORG Shell  ] and [ORG Devon  ] produce today in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Talk of " another [LOC Campos Basin  ] below the [LOC Campos Basin  ] " and large potential in [LOC Santos Basin  ] has been circulating through the oil community for a while . 
In 2005 , [ORG Petrobras  ] began drilling the [LOC Parati  ] well in the [LOC Santos Basin  ] , the first well to reach hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs below a 2 mile-thick layer of salt . 
The well was the most expensive ever in the country , but it was key as it confirmed that there was indeed oil below the salt that might be put into production . 
Since then , [ORG Petrobras  ] drilled three other wells in the area ( along with four others in different areas off of [LOC Brazil  ] 's coast ) and all found relatively light oil ( 28-30 [ORG API  ] ) below the salt . 
The [MISC Tupi  ] announcement in November 2007 was the crowning event of a long process. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) However , industry insiders never considered [MISC Tupi  ] as the largest structure in the region . 
With the latest technology available , subsurface maps of what the area below the salt layer might look like have indicated that it is only the smaller of two relatively large " hills " under the salt . 
If oil bearing , the larger [LOC RIO DE JAN  ] 00000091 002 OF 003 structure might hold a quantity of oil estimated to be between 30-40 billion barrels . 
Located to the south of [LOC Tupi  ] , the larger structure has yet to be given a public name but is being referred to by the industry as " [LOC Sugarloaf  ] . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Petrobras  ] tested one well in the [LOC Sugarloaf  ] structure last year in the [MISC BM-S-9  ] block ( [PER Carioca  ] ) and is still drilling another . 
It operates the block in partnership with [ORG BG Group  ] ( 30% ) and [ORG Repsol  ] ( 25% ) . 
In an official release , [ORG Petrobras  ] stated that the second well has not yet reached the sub-salt level . 
In the absence of more conclusive data on the block 's potential , [ORG Petrobras  ] is remaining tight-lipped . 
Through its work in [LOC Brazil  ] and in [LOC Mexico  ] 's deep-water reserves , [ORG Petrobras  ] has developed expertise and a reputation as a leader in cutting edge deepwater drilling technology. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While [ORG Petrobras  ] is getting the majority of the press play right now , it should be noted that other companies are also well positioned should a discovery at [LOC Sugarloaf  ] be confirmed . 
The [MISC BM-S-22  ] block , just south of [ORG Petrobras' Carioca  ] block , is thought to be the apex of the structure and is operated by [ORG Exxon  ] ( 40% ) in partnership with [PER Hess  ] ( 40% ) and [ORG Petrobras  ] ( 20% ) . 
Galp , [ORG BG  ] , and [ORG Shell  ] also have minority stakes in neighboring blocks . 
[ORG Exxon Brazil  ] President [PER John Knapp  ] told [ORG Mission Brazil  ] officers that the industry as a whole is extremely excited about pre-salt opportunities in [LOC Brazil  ] , but cautioned that the government and press euphoria does not sufficiently take into account the serious technological and financial challenges of drilling so deep . 
[PER Knapp  ] also expressed some concern that , in this euphoria , the [ORG GOB  ] may be tempted to change its current concession model which industry views as fair , transparent , and effective in order to allow the [ORG GOB  ] and [ORG Petrobras  ] to take ma ximum advantage of the finds , possibly at the expense of the international oil community . 
Next Steps for the Government of [LOC Brazil  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As previously reported ( [PER Ref A  ] ) , the Government of [LOC Brazil  ] withdrew 41 prime blocks in the [LOC Santos Basin  ] from auction shortly after the [MISC Tupi  ] announcement in November 2007 . 
Pending a determination of how to best develop the [LOC Santos Basin  ] pre-salt reserves and capture the most revenue , no further bidding will take place . 
This has international industry concerned since , in the absence of new exploration opportunities , they could be forced to leave [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[ORG ANP  ] has formed a task force and contracted international consulting firm [ORG Wood MacKenzie  ] to study how other countries handle such contracts . 
[ORG ANP  ] has also expressed interest in sending a delegation to the [LOC U.S.  ] to study how the [ORG USG  ] handles contracts in the [LOC Gulf  ] of [LOC Mexico  ] and in [LOC Alaska.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While [ORG Petrobras  ] CEO [PER Sergio Gabrielli  ] has made public comments t hat [LOC Brazil  ] should look into amending its [ORG Petroleum Law  ] , industry insiders and academic experts agree that the most likely outcome is for [LOC Brazil  ] to maintain its current concessions arrangement and increase the government 's take , or " special participation rate " ( maybe to as high as 80 percent ) . 
There is likely not enough support within the [ORG Congress  ] to support such a new [ORG Petroleum Law  ] , and little confidence in [LOC Congress'  ] ability to come up with a palatable new framework . 
The benefit of increasing the special participation rate is that it can be achieved by Presidential Decree. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Petrobras  ] would also likely oppose any change towards a production sharing or service contract regime . 
It appears as though [PER Gabrielli  ] 's strategy is to stall the auction process for a few years so that [ORG Petrobras  ] can be better positioned , financially , to bid competitively on the prime blocks . 
As it is , [ORG Petrobras  ] is confronting serious resource constraints on [MISC Tupi  ] , and getting [LOC Sugarloaf  ] into product ion may be beyond its current capabilities . 
There is a worldwide shortage of geologists , engineers and equipment , and the depth of these discoveries ( 2000 plus meters of water and up to two miles of salt ) would require the most advanced ( and most expensive ) drilling technology on the market . 
( Note: There are only a few drills capable of drilling at such depths . 
Per ref B , two of these have been reserved to begin work at [MISC Tupi  ] in 2009 . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Supported by key players within the [MISC Brazilian  ] government , such as Presidential Chief of Staff and Chairman of [ORG Petrobras' Board of Directors  ] [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] , [ORG Petrobras  ] is shifting resources to develop [MISC Tupi  ] as quickly as possible . 
The government views the new sub-salt discoveries as a good source of future political leverage , and is about to embark on a [MISC US$50  ] million publicity campaign to spread the news about [LOC Brazil  ] 's apparent new oil riches . 
If [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] indeed runs for the presidency in 20 10 , it is possible that these oil and gas developments combined with the government 's large-scale planned infrastructure projects could boost her profile as a candidate . 
Comment ------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The potential discovery of additional oil deposits in the [LOC Santos Basin  ] is certainly good news for [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Unfortunately , the bad news is that there is insufficient drilling equipment to bring these resources on line quickly and there remain significant technological hurdles to drilling in such extreme conditions . 
If the best estimates have the [MISC Tupi  ] field producing no sooner than 2013 even with the full support of [ORG Petrobras  ] and the rest of the [ORG GOB  ] , developing " [LOC Sugarloaf  ] " may indeed take some time . 
Undoubtedly , however , these discoveries have the potential to make [LOC Brazil  ] a player in international energy markets and may have an impact on [LOC Venezuela  ] 's role for the region as well . 
The [ORG GOB  ] 's decisions on how to develop the area will have further impact on [LOC U.S.  ] companies' ability to partici pate in these exciting new finds .
