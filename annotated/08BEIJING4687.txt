End Summary . 
" [MISC Chinese  ] [ORG Uighur  ] Terrorists in [LOC Guantanamo  ] " ----------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Assistant Foreign Minister [PER Liu Jieyi  ] called the Ambassador into the Foreign Ministry December 29 to officially record [LOC China  ] 's " grave concern " over the [ORG State Department  ] spokesperson 's December 23 statements that repatriating [MISC Chinese  ] Uighurs held in [LOC Guantanamo  ] to [LOC China  ] would not be prudent and furthermore that the [ORG USG  ] appreciates the consideration given by [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC Portugal  ] , [LOC France  ] , [LOC Switzerland  ] and other [MISC European  ] states to accepting these individuals . 
The suspects are members of the [ORG East Turkestan Islamic Movement  ] ( [ORG ETIM  ] ) , a group listed by the [ORG UN Security Council  ] ( [ORG UNSC  ] ) Resolution 1267 committee as a terrorist organization , AFM [PER Liu  ] alleged . 
Furthermore , the [ORG U.S. Department of Justice  ] has indicated that the suspects acknowledged in interviews that , when captured , they were in [LOC Afghanistan  ] for weapons training to fight the [MISC Chinese  ] Government . 
As such , the [ORG Uighur  ] detainees should be returned to [LOC China  ] " as a matter of course " so that they can be dealt with in keeping with [MISC Chinese  ] law . 
Transferring them to a third country would violate the relevant [ORG UNSC  ] resolutions , would not be in keeping with the [MISC United States'  ] international commitments , would harm [LOC China  ] 's judicial sovereignty and national security , and could end up being a risk to [LOC U.S.  ] security as terrorists sometimes turn their focus from one nation to another , [PER Liu  ] said. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [LOC China  ] believes [MISC U.S.-China  ] counter-terrorism cooperation should be based on reciprocity and mutual benefit and therefore opposes transferring the [ORG Uighur  ] detainees to a third country . 
Noting that [MISC Sino-U.S.  ] relations are at an important " moment of transition , " he urged the [LOC United States  ] to consider overall bilateral relations , our common counter-terrorism interests and the " utmost sensitivity " of the issue and repatriate the individuals to [LOC China  ] . 
Doing so would avoid harm to bilateral relations and to cooperation " in important areas . 
" AFM [PER Liu  ] also urged the [ORG USG  ] to advise the incoming administration of the importance of this issue . 
The Ambassador took note of [LOC PRC  ] concerns . 
[ORG Taiwan Inauguration Delegation  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [LOC China  ] is " extremely concerned " by reports in the [LOC Taiwan  ] press that [LOC Taiwan  ] 's " so-called " [ORG Legislative Yuan President Wang Jyng-ping  ] will " lead an official delegation " to the [LOC United States  ] for the January 20 inauguration , [PER Liu  ] said . 
Furthermore , the delegation may include opposition party [ORG DPP  ] representative [PER Annette Lu  ] , whom he described as " bent on [MISC Taiwanese  ] independence . 
" Noting that [LOC Taiwan  ] is the most sensitive issue in [LOC Sino-U.S.  ] relations and that [LOC China  ] 's one-China principle " cannot change , " [PER Liu  ] said that [LOC China  ] firmly opposes official exchanges between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Taiwan  ] . 
As the inauguration is an important and official event , participation by the delegation and [PER Annette Lu  ] would [LOC BEIJING  ] 00004687 002 OF 002 be a serious violation of the One [LOC China  ] policy and the three [ORG Joint Communiques  ] , would " send a seriously wrong signal " to [LOC Taiwan  ] independence forces , and would interfere with bilateral and cross-Strait relations , [PER Liu  ] said . 
He urged the [LOC United States  ] to recognize the sensitivity and complexity of the [LOC Taiwan  ] issue and not allow the delegation or [PER Annette Lu  ] or other " independence characters " to attend , nor to conduct any official [MISC U.S.-Taiwan  ] exchanges , and to advise the incoming administration and [ORG Congress  ] of the sensitivity of the issue . 
[PER Liu  ] added that the [LOC United States  ] should guard against allowing [ORG Wang  ] and the delegation to travel to the [LOC United States  ] and to characterize the trip as " official . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Ambassador responded that while representatives of the [MISC Washington-based  ] diplomatic corps are invited to the inauguration , no delegations are invited from abroad . 
As such , there are no " official " foreign delegations attending at the invitation of the Administration . 
[ORG Human Rights: Charter  ] 08 and [PER Liu Xiaobo  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The Ambassador raised [LOC U.S.  ] concerns regarding the continued detention of dissident writer and rights activist [PER Liu Xiaobo  ] ( reftel ) , a signer of and organizer behind the [ORG Charter  ] 08 democracy manifesto issued in conjunction with international [ORG Human Rights Day  ] December 10 . 
The Ambassador noted deep [LOC U.S.  ] concern regarding reports that [MISC Chinese  ] citizens have been detained , interrogated and harassed as they prepared to commemorate [ORG Human Rights Day  ] and the 60th anniversary of the adoption of the [ORG Universal Declaration of Human Rights  ] . 
He stressed particular concern regarding the well-being of [PER Liu  ] , who remains in custody and called on the [MISC Chinese  ] Government to release [PER Liu  ] and cease harassment of all [MISC Chinese  ] citizens who peacefully express the desire for internationally recognized fundamental freedoms. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) AFM [PER Liu  ] responded that this issue is a rule of law issue , not a human rights issue and expressed certitude that the case would be dealt with in accordance with [LOC PRC  ] law . 
He disagreed with the [LOC U.S.  ] assertions as to what should be done with [PER Liu  ] and any others on the grounds that the only determinant for the correct handling of the matter will be [LOC PRC  ] law . 
Furthermore , AFM [PER Liu  ] stated , the [MISC Chinese  ] Government does not accept outside interference in [LOC China  ] 's internal affairs .
