Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) A jump in the number of " mass incidents , " or violent protests against local governments , in June is unrelated to the recent ethnic riots in [LOC Xinjiang  ] and does not signal a threat to overall social stability , Embassy contacts report . 
However , violent incidents indicate serious discontent below the surface that will worsen over time . 
The underlying causes are longstanding citizen hostility toward local officials due to corruption and abuse of power in [LOC China  ] 's Communist Party-controlled political order . 
Moreover , vested interests are pushing their demands more aggressively during a year of politically sensitive anniversaries , calculating that the authorities will be more inclined to compromise in the interest of maintaining stability . 
The [ORG Party has  ] responded by boosting anti-riot training for local officials , temporarily broadening the boundaries for expression of public opinion on the [MISC Internet  ] while simultaneously targeting specific websites for tight control , and attempting to re-invigorate village elections . 
Contacts tell us that on campus , a tight student job market will not likely lead to destabilizing political activism in the short run , but the rise of left-wing nationalism is a trend to watch . 
The [LOC Xinjiang  ] riots are different in kind and origin , but , like mass incidents , show the volatility of pent-up frustration and anger across [LOC China  ] . 
End Summary . 
Violent Protests in June: [MISC Hubei  ] and [LOC Jiangxi  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) A wave of new " mass incidents " ( [LOC China  ] 's term for protest activity that the leadership views as threatening to stability ) erupted in June in several parts of [LOC China  ] and was widely reported in local media . 
In one of the two major incidents , a June 17-20riot in [LOC Shishou City  ] , [LOC Hubei Province  ] , was triggered by the mysterious death of a chef in a government-owned hotel . 
The number of rioters quickly swelled from a few dozen to thousands as rumors spread that the chef was murdered by the hotel manager , in league with city officials , for threatening to disclose an alleged drug ring run out of the hotel . 
The riot was quelled after hundreds of rioters were injured in clashes with security forces and many police vehicles were damaged or destroyed . 
Another large protest was staged by more than one hundred furniture makers in [LOC Nankang City  ] , [LOC Jiangxi Province  ] , on June <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
The furniture makers gathered in front of the city government building to protest a new tax on the industry already hit hard by declining export demand . 
The [MISC Nankang  ] demonstrators overturned police vehicles and blocked a major highway for several hours . 
The protest subsided the same day when municipal authorities rescinded the tax on orders from the provincial governor . 
Mass Incidents Are Not All the Same ----------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] emphasized to PolOff on June 26 that the [MISC Hubei  ] and [LOC Jiangxi  ] incidents , respectively , represented different kinds of social protests even though both were indicative of simmering discontent lying just below the surface of [MISC Chinese  ] society . 
He said that [LOC Shishou  ] was similar to the [MISC Weng'an  ] riots in [LOC Guizhou Province  ] last year in which pent-up anger toward the government erupted spontaneously in response to an event that had little or no relationship to the immediate concerns or grievances of the protestors . 
( Note . 
See ref: as many as 30,000 protestors rioted for several days in June 2008 , destroying the [ORG Wengan Party  ] headquarters and other official property . 
The local [ORG Party Secretary  ] eventually resigned . 
) While disturbing to the leadership , such events were nonetheless isolated , localized incidents that could be contained , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] observed . 
The violence in [LOC Jiangxi  ] , on the other hand , represented a systemic problem , in [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] view . 
This kind of protest was more dangerous , he said , because it was issue-driven and affected interests that cut across local and regional boundaries , and hence held the potential to spread to other areas. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said it was very difficult to assess the overall impact of mass incidents on social stability , but , like [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , he stressed the importance of distinguishing between the spontaneous , random violence of [MISC Weng'an  ] and [LOC Shishou  ] and protests driven by the clash of [LOC BEIJING  ] 00001970 002 OF 004 " vested interests " ( liyi you guanfang ) . 
In a meeting with PolOff on June 30 , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that [MISC Weng'an-type  ] riots tended to be " seasonal " in nature , occurring during the summer when lots of people were in the streets . 
The [LOC Jiangxi  ] protest , on the other hand , was triggered by those with veste interests of all kinds . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that there had been many such protests recently: In addition to the widely publicized taxi-driver strikes in several provinces , there had been bus driver strikes , elementary and middle-school teacher strikes ( [LOC Chongqing  ] ) , and wharf worker and boatmen strikes ( in [LOC Guizhou  ] ) , among others , all of which involved disputes over salaries . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the timing of these strikes and protests was deliberate . 
Once [ORG Party  ] leaders had declared 2009 a year of sensitive anniversaries and had called for redoubled efforts to ensure " harmony " and stability , people pressed hard for the government to satisfy their demands , calculating that authorities would be more responsive in order to maintain stability . 
Underlying Cause: [LOC China  ] 's [ORG Party System  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The heart of the problem , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained , was a political order that gave local officials enormous power , including control over the distribution of wealth and the resources to ensure that their own interests were well served . 
As a result , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , this " structural contradiction " had resulted in a long-term hostile environment , characterized by a breakdown of trust between local officials and residents and near-total lack of official credibility . 
When officials spoke , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , " no one pays attention " because " no one believes anything a cadre says . 
" In his view , this situation unfairly penalized those officials who were capable and honest , with a recent case in [LOC Zhengzhou  ] , [LOC Henan  ] province being the most recent example . 
In a slip of the tongue that brought the point home , a [LOC Zhengzhou  ] official became the focus of [MISC Internet  ] praise and ridicule when he admitted in a public exchange with a reporter that [LOC China  ] 's media and local officials served the interests of the [ORG Party rather  ] than the people . 
In response to a state-owned radio reporter 's criticism of city officials for illegally building luxury villas on land that had been allocated for low-income housing , the official angrily shot back " for whom do you speak , the [ORG Party or  ] the people , " with the clear implication that he and the reporter both spoke for the [ORG Party .  ] 
The reporter , apparently not realizing the implications of the remark , published it as an example of imperious officialdom . 
Some netizens praised the official for speaking the truth while others mocked him for blatantly ignoring the interests of ordinary people . 
The phrase " for whom do you speak " became the catch phrase of the day on the [MISC Internet  ] , a symbol of people 's deep distrust of officials and anger at the systemic disregard for rule of law and citizen rights . 
This was a " structural " problem , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] repeated , embedded in the nature of the cadre system , which even President [PER Hu Jintao  ] and Premier [PER Wen Jiabao  ] had so far been unable to crack , despite robust efforts . 
The situation could only get worse before it gets better , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] concluded , thus , " we can expect more and more " mass incidents . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , too , asserted that " structural contradictions " lay at the heart of the mass incident problem . 
People saw official machinations , corruption , or avarice behind every negative event , he said , noting the recent collapse of a 13-story building in [LOC Shanghai  ] as the most recent example of this mindset . 
[LOC Shanghai  ] was one of [LOC China  ] 's better-run cities , with an experienced and savvy cadre force and a clean [ORG Party Secretary  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] opined , but people immediately jumped to the conclusion that corruption was the culprit . 
( Note: [MISC Chinese  ] media have since reported that the collapse was caused by inept construction workers who allowed dirt to pile up on one side of the building even as they excavated a deep hole on the other side . 
) However , this lack of trust and credibility showed a deeper flaw in [LOC China  ] 's political order . 
As a result , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] predicted , more mass incidents lay ahead . 
Although people blamed local officials for their problems and still viewed the central government as their last hope for redress of grievances this could change if the financial crisis persisted . 
Rights Lawyer: no Threat to Stability ------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told PolOffs on June 23 that he thought that mass incidents had not reached a stage where they posed a threat to [LOC China  ] 's overall stability . 
While they represented an expression of general anger over citizens' personal situations and deep resentment toward [ORG Party  ] officials , they were still localized . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the underlying dynamic was a self-perpetuating cycle [LOC BEIJING  ] 00001970 003 OF 004 of violence and counter-violence on both sides born of a " contradiction " in citizen-official relationships . 
If local authorities were actually to follow the law , he observed , this would mean relaxing control and allowing more freedom of expression . 
People would respond by criticizing the government or by making demands that authorities were not willing to meet . 
Thus , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained , authorities kept a tight lid on all social discontent which in turn fostered seething resentment that periodically erupte into violent protest . 
The official response to these protests often amplified popular anger and frustration , thus continuing the cycle . 
There will be no " [MISC Chinese  ] [PER Gorbachev  ] , " he exclaimed , no breakthrough in the short term . 
The only answer , in XXXXXXXXXXXX’s view , was continued , gradual , and patient education in " the spirit of rule of law " among the people to eliminate their " slave mentality . 
" [ORG Cadre Training  ] , [MISC Internet  ] Control , Local Elections --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the " lessons of [MISC Weng'an  ] , " both positive and negative , had been carefully studied by central authorities and that , in anticipation of an upsurge in protests this year , the central government had launched an ambitious program of anti-riot and crowd-control training for local officials . 
Three thousand county level administrators , 3,000 county-level public security directors , 2,000 county-level discipline inspection directors and 500 local procuratorate cadres had already completed such training in [LOC Beijing  ] . 
They were in turn expected to train the relevant personnel in subordinate jurisdictions. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also claimed that the [ORG Party had  ] bee following a carefully calibrated approach to [MISC Internet  ] control during the year , especially in the runup to [LOC National Day  ] , allowing more general expression of public opinion , while targeting specific websites for close monitoring . 
The highly publicized webchats with netizens conducted by [PER Hu Jintao  ] and [PER Wen Jiabao  ] earlier in the year were designed to reinforce the public perception that top leaders were encouraging greater public discussion on the [MISC Internet  ] , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] himself had noticed a significant uptick in the volume of [MISC Internet  ] chatter , including provocative commentary on sensitive issues . 
( Note: Recent examples include an article in the June 1 issue of the [ORG Xinhua-owned  ] news weekly [ORG Outlook Weekly  ] ( [ORG Liaowang  ] ) analyzing the factors that contribute to mass incidents and predicting a significant increase of such events this year ; and a blog by a [LOC Shishou  ] official who was critical of the city government 's efforts to " mislead the public " by blaming the riot on local criminals . 
The official called for an objective analysis of the causes of the riots , which he attributed to poor government and police corruption in [LOC Shishou  ] , to prevent such events in the future . 
) <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) At the same time , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , the [ORG Party was  ] targeting " ideological " and " protest " websites of both the right and the left for more aggressive monitoring . 
In addition to the usual practice of issuing propaganda guidance by telephone , text message , or by directives to select webmasters , propaganda authorities were now designating specific websites as sites of special concern . 
He said that the [ORG State Council  ] and [ORG Beijing Information Offices  ] recently convened a meeting of [MISC Internet  ] monitors to discuss tight control of seven websites: Two ultra-left sites , Utopia ( wuyou zhi xiang ) and Maoflag ; a site featuring a wide range of reform-oriented urban middle-class views , [PER Boke  ] ( Bokee ) ; and four sites with a " liberal " reputation frequented by professionals and intellectuals: [PER Xici  ] , [LOC Tianya  ] , [PER Tianyi  ] , and [LOC China  ] Elections . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ; [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that he had been told by a friend with [MISC Internet  ] monitoring responsibility that there would be a drastic tightening up on [MISC Internet  ] content next year , once the sensitive commemoration season was over. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Taking a somewhat different tack , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [PER PolOff  ] on [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that , in light of high-profile unrest incidents , the [ORG Communist Party  ] was looking to revitalize village elections as a means of relieving social pressures and providing a nonviolent outlet to political grievances . 
Specifically , the [ORG Party 's Central Organization Department  ] had recently convened a meeting on ensuring compliance with existing legislation mandating regular village elections . 
In recent years apathy and corruption on the part of local officials had resulted in many villages failing to hold elections as required by law . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the [ORG Party viewed  ] this as a dangerous trend that could exacerbate the simmering grievances . 
Nonetheless , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was not optimistic that village elections could realize the [ORG Party 's  ] goal of reducing the frequency of unrest . 
[LOC BEIJING  ] 00001970 004 OF 004 Student Activism: Leftist Nationalism , Not Employment --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he didn't foresee a stability problem emerging from the tight job market for graduating college students , but he was concerned about the increase of " radical nationalism " and a " leftward drift " among college students that could lead to destabilizing student activism in the future . 
Graduating seniors and graduate students at [LOC China  ] 's elite universities were having no trouble finding jobs , he said , although those from second- and third-tier universities were running into greater obstacles . 
However , potential discontent over job pressure was offset by the many graduates who had responded to the [ORG Party 's  ] call , and incentives , to take jobs in the hinterland and by the thousands more who were lining up to join the military . 
Growing student nationalism , on the other hand , was a trend to be concerned about , in [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's view , especially when wedded to " leftist " politics . 
He said he had warned [ORG Party  ] leaders that the student threat of the future would not come from pro-democracy activists but from the anti-democratic left who may take to the streets to demand a return to " true socialism . 
" [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] estimated that as many as 20 percent of the students at [ORG People 's University  ] were " left-leaning radical nationalists . 
" Many , he said , were active on the ultra-left web portal " Utopia " where they posted comments under the rubric of " the alliance of citizens on the left " ( gongmin zuo lianmeng ) . 
Mass Incidents Are Not Ethnic Riots ----------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Ethnic riots like those in [LOC Xinjiang  ] July 5-7 and in [LOC Tibet  ] in March of 2008 differ markedly in origin and nature from mass incidents , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] emphasized to [PER PolOff  ] on [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
Both present serious problems for the [ORG Party , XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , but the [ORG Party leadership  ] would not hesitate to open fire on Uighurs or [MISC Tibetans  ] if they deemed it necessary to restore order . 
Mass incidents pose a different kind of threat , he said , as the leadership is " afraid " to fire on [ORG Han  ] rioters for fear of sparking massive public outrage that would turn against the [ORG Party  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [PER PolOff  ] on [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that the [LOC Xinjiang  ] riots and the June mass incidents were different in kind but shared an important similarity . 
In her view , at least some rioters in [LOC Xinjiang  ] took to the streets because of general discontent unrelated to the immediate cause of the violence . 
[ORG Han  ] people do not hate Uighurs and are not looking for revenge , she said , but some people " can always find an excuse to express their grievances .
