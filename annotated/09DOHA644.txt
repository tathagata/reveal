<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L DOHA 000644 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 10/28/2019 TAGS PREL , PTER , [LOC LY  ] , [LOC UK  ] , QA SUBJECT: MFA OFFICIAL: QATAR’S INVOLVEMENT IN [MISC AL-MEGRAHI  ] RELEASE STEMMED FROM [ORG ARAB LEAGUE  ] REQUEST TO [LOC QATAR  ] AS [MISC ARAB  ] [ORG LEAGUE  ] PRESIDENT Classified By: Ambassador [PER Joseph E. LeBaron  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b and d ) . -------------- ( C ) KEY POINTS -------------- -- At an October 28 meeting with MFA Minister of State for [ORG International Cooperation Khalid Al-Attiyah  ] , Ambassador raised strong USG concerns about Qatar’s role in the release of convicted [LOC Lockerbie  ] bomber [PER Abdelbasit Al-Magrahi  ] . 
-- [PER Al-Attiyah  ] said that [LOC Qatar  ] became involved because [LOC Qatar  ] , as 2009 President of the [ORG Arab League  ] , had been asked by the [ORG Arab League  ] to do so . 
[PER Al-Magrahi  ] had also petitioned the [ORG Amir  ] for help , but [MISC Al-Maghrahi’s  ] request was only a secondary factor , [PER Al-Attiyah  ] indicated . 
-- [PER Al-Attiyah  ] , who was directly involved in the issue , stressed that [LOC Qatar  ] had been very careful to abide by [MISC Scottish  ] law . 
-- When pressed by Ambassador over whether financial incentives were involved , [PER Al-Attiyah  ] replied “That is ridiculous . 
It was not necessary to offer money , and we did not.” ------------ ( C ) COMMENTS ------------ -- The [ORG Amir  ] does have a history of responding to personal appeals from abroad for mercy , whether from prisoners seeking amnesty or political exiles seeking a home . 
[LOC Doha  ] has several notable exiles . 
Al-Attiyah’s explanation of the appeal from [MISC Al-Megrahi  ] as a motivating factor rings truthful , even if it was of secondary importance . 
End Key Points and Comments . 
1 . 
( C ) During an October 28 meeting with MFA Minister of State for [ORG International Cooperation Khalid Al-Attiyah  ] , Ambassador raised the USG’s strong objections to the August 20 release of convicted [LOC Lockerbie  ] bomber Adbulbasit [MISC Al-Megrahi.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Al-Attiyah  ] , who played a direct role in the release , explained that [LOC Qatar  ] became involved in the issue for two reasons: first and foremost , the [ORG Arab League  ] had asked [LOC Qatar  ] , in its capacity as the current chair of the [ORG Arab League  ] , to seek [MISC Al-Megrahi’s  ] release on humanitarian grounds ; second , [MISC Al-Megrahi  ] had sent a personal letter to [ORG Amir  ] Hamad bin [PER Khalifa Al Thani  ] pleading for humanitarian intervention. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On the basis of these two factors , [PER Al-Attiyah  ] said he was dispatched to [LOC Scotland  ] to meet with the Minister of [ORG Justice  ] there . 
He made clear to the Minister that Qatar’s efforts would be conducted entirely within the framework of the [MISC Scottish  ] law on humanitarian release of prisoners judged to have just a short time to live . 
On the basis of that provision , he said , the Minister of [LOC Justice  ] rejected [MISC Al-Megrahi’s  ] release under the [ORG Prisoner Transfer Agreement  ] between the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC Libya  ] , but authorized it on humanitarian grounds. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Ambassador pressed the issue of whether [LOC Qatar  ] had offered any financial or trade incentives to induce [MISC Al-Megrahi’s  ] release . 
[PER Al-Attiyah  ] strongly dismissed such speculation , saying “That is ridiculous.” It was not necessary to offer money . 
It was all done within [MISC Scottish  ] law . 
We offered no money , investment , or payment of any kind .
