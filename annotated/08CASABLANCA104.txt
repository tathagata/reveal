( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: In [LOC Casablanca  ] , [LOC Morocco  ] 's largest city and economic capital , prosperity is increasingly on display , raising the question of where it comes from . 
Family money , the banking and real estate sectors , and a strong-performing stock market account for some wealth . 
Remittances from [MISC Moroccans  ] living abroad , tourism , and foreign investment , especially from [LOC Gulf  ] countries , comprise the major external sources of money . 
Illicit sources of income including drug trafficking , money laundering and endemic corruption play a role in the growing economy as well . 
Increased consumption has been a boon to the economy , but [LOC Casablanca  ] 's wealth must be shared more broadly to benefit all segments of society . 
End Summary. -------------------------- INTERNAL SOURCES OF WEALTH -------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The easily-observable phenomenon of wealth in [LOC Casablanca  ] begs the question of where the money comes from . 
Many Casablancans cite family money as one key contributor to the city 's affluence . 
According to XXXXXXXXXXXX , the textile industry , based in [LOC Fez  ] , traditionally drove the [MISC Moroccan  ] economy . 
In the 1970s and 80s , textile producers relocated to [LOC Casablanca  ] for retail opportunities , creating economic momentum and bringing money to the city . 
An article in the [LOC Middle East Report  ] on [LOC Morocco  ] 's bourgeoisie supports this historical view , though dates the shift to the end of [MISC World War II:  ] " The economic center of gravity shifted to the coastal cities , especially [LOC Casablanca  ] . 
Enterprising businessmen left [LOC Fez  ] for [LOC Casablanca  ] , where they continued to be known as [ORG Fassis  ] . 
" Even today , natives of [LOC Fez  ] retain their reputation as members of a business-savvy elite . 
One of [LOC Morocco  ] 's richest men , [PER Othman Benjelloun  ] , hails from [LOC Fez  ] and is Chairman and CEO of [ORG BMCE  ] , [LOC Morocco  ] 's third largest bank . 
According to [ORG BMCE  ] employees , a 'Fez mafia' dominates the bank 's culture . 
[PER Benjelloun  ] and others like him belong to a long-standing , moneyed elite who contribute to [LOC Casablanca  ] 's prosperity. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) The banking sector , based in [LOC Casablanca  ] , also generates wealth . 
[LOC Morocco  ] 's 15 banks include five Moroccan-owned private banks and five foreign banks . 
Thanks to expanding geographic networks and increased banking products and services , including e-banking , mortgages and consumer credit , the sector has enjoyed impressive growth . 
Overall , bank revenues rose 10.5 percent in 2006 to reach [MISC USD  ] 2.56 billion . 
The same year , [LOC Morocco  ] 's banks registered net profits of [MISC USD  ] 825 million , a 68 percent increase over the previous year . 
Such strong performance has triggered an increase in hiring , particularly of young , well-educated [MISC Moroccans  ] . 
It has also led several of the six banks listed on the [ORG Casablanca Stock Exchange  ] to offer employee stock options , enabling staff members to share in their bank 's profitability . 
[ORG BMCE Bank  ] 's 2007 Annual Report notes that employees averaged gains of 380 percent from the bank 's second public offering , " which is the equivalent of roughly 15 times the net monthly salary . 
" Such tremendous performance has a spillover effect on [LOC Casablanca  ] 's economy. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Just as the banking sector contributes to [LOC Casablanca  ] 's wealth , so does the real estate market , due to a convergence of factors . 
The scarcity of land in densely-packed [LOC Casablanca  ] puts property at a premium . 
According to the [ORG Oxford Business Group  ] , the city covers 69.5 square miles of land , but needs over 100 square miles to support the current population of over three million . 
As [MISC Moroccans  ] have moved from rural areas to [LOC Casablanca  ] , land prices have risen . 
The influx of foreign direct investment ( [ORG FDI  ] ) compounds this effect . 
Of the seven billion dollars of [ORG FDI  ] that [LOC Morocco  ] received in 2007 , real estate accounted for 26 percent - second only to tourism at 29 percent . 
Given that 63 percent of investors find [LOC Casablanca  ] the most attractive locale for investment in [LOC Morocco  ] , [ORG FDI  ] has had a significant impact on property values in the city - and on the development of a market for high-end goods and services. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In such an environment , speculation occurs , pushing prices upward and enabling landowners to make staggering profits . 
No sooner is a new [ORG Master Plan  ] for [ORG Urban Development  ] ( [ORG SDAU  ] ) announced than speculators buy up property in targeted areas with the sole intention of flipping them . 
According to Century 21 's Benmakhlouf , " you can buy property for one million dirham and it'll be worth 1.5 million in six months . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The tremendous performance of [LOC Casablanca  ] 's [ORG Stock Exchange  ] is also a factor in wealth-creation . 
According to XXXXXXXXXXXX , many companies attract investors by listing shares at weak prices for the initial public offering . 
After a few weeks , prices shoot up , allowing shareholders to sell at a considerable profit . 
As [LOC Morocco  ] 's largest city and economic center , [LOC Casablanca  ] sees much of the money that [MISC Moroccans  ] make in the stock market. -------------------------- EXTERNAL SOURCES OF WEALTH -------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) As indicated above , [LOC Casablanca  ] has benefited from an influx of money from outside the country . 
First , remittances from [MISC Moroccans  ] resident abroad ( [LOC MREs  ] ) have risen since [PER Mohammed VI  ] became king in 1999 , reaching about [MISC USD  ] 7.8 billion in 2007 . 
Second , tourism brings in significant capital . 
The sector has increased 12 to 14 percent per year since 2001 , when the king launched the strategic tourism development policy " Vision 2010 . 
" According to a 2007 report issued by [LOC Casablanca  ] 's [ORG Regional Investment Center  ] , tourism accounted for more investment in [LOC Casablanca  ] than any other sector. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) Foreign investment is a third significant source of wealth in [LOC Casablanca  ] . 
Benefiting heavily from rising oil prices , oil-exporting [LOC Gulf  ] countries seek substantial investment opportunities in the [LOC Middle East  ] , including [LOC Casablanca  ] . 
[ORG Dubai Holding  ] , for example , has begun a [MISC USD  ] 500 million project to build a multi-purpose marina adjacent to [LOC Casablanca  ] 's port . 
A Kuwaiti-Moroccan group has plans for a residential development in the city . 
Investors outside the [LOC Gulf  ] are also pursuing financial opportunities in [LOC Casablanca  ] . 
As money from [LOC MREs  ] , tourism and foreign investors is channeled into banks , real estate , the stock market and other investments , [LOC Casablanca  ] 's economy expands. ------------------------- ILLICIT SOURCES OF WEALTH ------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Most Casablancans acknowledge that at least some of [LOC Casablanca  ] 's wealth comes from illicit activities such as drug-trafficking and money laundering . 
In the words of XXXXXXXXXXXX , " We have dirty money . 
The problem is we don't know how much . 
" Statistics do not exist to quantify how much of [LOC Casablanca  ] 's wealth can be traced to illicit activities . 
However , one indication can be found in the [ORG USG  ] 's own 2007 [ORG International Narcotics Control Strategy Report:  ] " [LOC Morocco  ] is the world 's biggest producer of cannabis resin ( hashish ) and is consistently ranked among the world 's largest producers of cannabis . 
" The report estimates that [LOC Morocco  ] 's drug trade ( mostly to [LOC Europe  ] ) nets about [MISC USD  ] 13 billion per year , more than twice the amount brought in by tourism in 2007 . 
Some portion of this money finds its way to [LOC Casablanca  ] , where it is either spent on jewelry , cars , houses and other items , or it is laundered . 
Referring to the use of cafes as fronts for illegitimate business activities , one finance professional joked that " money laundering creates a nice cafe culture in [LOC Casablanca  ] . 
" <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Corruption also accounts for a certain amount of [LOC Casablanca  ] 's wealth . 
" You cannot imagine how big the impact is , " said one long-time resident after explaining the phenomenon of officials exploiting inside information and/or power for financial gain . 
In one notorious case , a police officer created a business to import [ORG BMW  ] motorcycles after learning that the police force had plans to equip a motorcycle brigade . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX noted that building permits for land set aside by the city sometimes become available to developers who pay bribes . 
Such corruption enables those who benefit from it to amass significant , if undeclared , wealth. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The informal economy is yet another vector by which individuals amass wealth . 
While the term conjures up images of small-scale retailers or undocumented laborers , it can include full-fledged businesses that operate outside the legal framework and its requirements . 
In [LOC Morocco  ] 's textile industry , for example , entire plants have closed their formal operations , only to reopen outside city limits as all-cash enterprises that function under the radar of [MISC Moroccan  ] authorities ( or with their complicity ) . 
The [LOC Casablanca  ] mattress factory that burned down in late April 2008 , killing 58 workers ( [ORG REF  ] A ) , offers a prime example of a situation in which a business owner flouted labor , safety and building codes in the name of profit. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The Consulate 's own experience trying to purchase land for a new facility illustrates how entrenched informal , under-the-table arrangements are in the [MISC Moroccan  ] economy . 
Ninety percent of property transactions in [LOC Casablanca  ] are done informally . 
Of over 30 sites identified , more than 20 fell off the list immediately because the brokers were unwilling to sell in an official deal . 
Others declined to sell because they are waiting for prices to appreciate . 
Of those who would sell , many wanted money under the table in addition to the [LOC CASABLANCA  ] 00000104 003 OF 003 asking price . 
Whether selling property , running a company or starting a business , the high volume of activity conducted outside of formal channels is part and parcel of doing business , and often enables individuals to skirt regulations and increase financial gain. ----------- CONSUMPTION ----------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Explaining the sources of [LOC Casablanca  ] 's wealth , however , does not necessarily explain consumption . 
As [PER Khalid Rouggani  ] of [ORG BMCE  ] 's research division sees it , [MISC Moroccans  ] are 'cultivated to be open' and want to know what exists outside their country . 
As a result , they are aware of foreign brands and products , and willingly purchase them , particularly in cosmopolitan [LOC Casablanca  ] . 
In contrast , [PER Rouggani  ] cited [LOC Algeria  ] - a country with [MISC USD  ] 120 billion in reserves that is less open to foreign culture and less apt to consume foreign goods . 
Sales clerks at [ORG Dior  ] and [PER Roberto Cavalli  ] seemed to support the view that culture plays a role in stimulating consumption , noting that " [MISC Moroccans  ] like to be stylish " and make up the majority of their clientele. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Strict foreign currency exchange controls may also contribute to consumption in [LOC Casablanca  ] . 
While [LOC Morocco  ] has loosened restrictions on the amount of currency [MISC Moroccans  ] can take out of the country , external controls are still in place . 
Unable to put significant savings overseas , many [MISC Moroccans  ] invest and spend locally. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Comment: The wealth that is evident in [LOC Casablanca  ] indicates many positive developments , including stock market and real estate booms , fueled by remittances and strong foreign investment . 
It also suggests some tough-to-track , but significant , negative elements , such as drug-trafficking and deep-seated corruption . 
No matter what the sources of wealth , however , the contrasts between rich and poor in [LOC Casablanca  ] are likely to persist , as there are few signs of trickle down . 
If Casablancans do not have opportunities to share in the wealth that surrounds them , the risk of broader social tensions is likely to increase . 
End Comment .
