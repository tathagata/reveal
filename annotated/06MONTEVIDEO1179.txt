[MISC Uruguayan  ] press coverage of [PER Augusto Pinochet  ] 's death on Human Rights day serves to reinforce the local assertion that leftists are the only " true " defenders of human rights .

[LOC Venezuela  ] 's [ORG Telesur  ] continues to broadcast accusations that the [LOC U.S.  ] sponsored " [MISC Plan Condor  ] , " while it flashes snippets of declassified documents on its cable broadcasts as " proof .

End Summary . 
PRESS REACTION TO PINOCHET'S DEATH ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Uruguayan  ] press coverage of [PER Augusto Pinochet  ] 's death on December 10 reinforces the local assertion that leftists are the only " true " defenders of human rights . 
Papers exude a great deal of nostalgia for the presidency of [PER Salvador Allende  ] and a vilification of those who mourn [PER Pinochet  ] 's passing . 
Socialist and [MISC Communist  ] legislators demonize him as the inspiration for other dictatorships in the region , including in [LOC Uruguay  ] , and papers convey a sense of joy in his death . 
Most reports imply a vindication of leftist ideology at the death of the man many consider to be the movement 's greatest enemy . 
[LOC Chile  ] 's economic success or the very real threat posed by international Communism during the [MISC Cold War  ] are seldom , if ever , mentioned . 
HIGH PROFILE TRIAL BEGINS ------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC U.S.  ] declassified documents from the period around the [LOC Uruguay  ] dictatorship have fueled leftist allegations that the [LOC U.S.  ] is an enemy of human rights . 
Prosecutors are using declassified [LOC U.S.  ] documents to bolster their case against Former [MISC Uruguayan  ] President [PER Juan Bordaberry  ] and Former [PER ForMin Juan Blanco  ] . 
The two men served during the early dictatorship and are charged with conspiracy to murder two opposition congressmen and two [ORG Tupamaros  ] in [LOC Argentina  ] ( reftel ) . 
While the [LOC U.S.  ] documents we have seen do not explicitly link the [LOC U.S.  ] to any regional conspiracy against opposition leftists , the case brings new attention to the aging issue . 
Commentators sloppily and regularly presume [LOC U.S.  ] complicity in [MISC Plan Condor  ] 's campaign of crushing guerrilla movements in the 1970s and endorsement of brutal methods. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In the current trial , one an important witness for the prosecution is [PER Martin Almeda  ] , a [MISC Paraguayan  ] lawyer who reportedly discovered " the [ORG Terror Archives  ] " of strongman [PER Alfredo Stroessner  ] 's 1954-89 dictatorship . 
The other is [PER Carlos Osorio  ] , an [ORG Information Systems Manager  ] at " The [ORG National Security Archive  ] , " an independent non-governmental research institute and library at [ORG George Washington University  ] . 
The media refers to [PER Osorio  ] as " one of the most important declassifiers of the [ORG State Department  ] 's private documents . 
" [ORG TELESUR  ] HERE ------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Meanwhile , [LOC Venezuela  ] 's [ORG Telesur  ] has been running a steady stream of high-quality , anti-American propaganda pieces . 
The " [MISC Injerencia  ] " series about [ORG CIA  ] " meddling " in [LOC Latin America  ] is a particularly slick product that incorporates documentary segments , present day interviews with witnesses and liberal use of selected declassified [ORG FOIA  ] documents . 
We note that [LOC Uruguay  ] has a ten percent stake in [ORG Telesur  ] ( which it pays by donating content ) and that the local government-owned channel has increased its broadcasting of conspiratorial , anti-U.S. propaganda in recent weeks . 
COMMENT: -------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The legacy of human rights abuses committed during the 1973-84 dictatorship is not a new theme in [LOC Uruguay  ] . 
In the immediate post-dictatorship period , many writers and editors accused the [LOC U.S.  ] of sponsoring [MISC Plan Condor  ] and of complicity in the dictatorship 's abuses . 
What is new is that the [ORG Frente Amplio  ] is now in power and has the political and media resources to make the old charges more uncomfortable for the [LOC U.S.  ] The dredging up of the past appears to be morphing into something more than mere " closure " or a politically convenient public distraction . 
The barrage of sophisticated propaganda links the [LOC U.S.  ] to the past abuses and paints it as the intellectual author of [MISC Plan Condor  ] . 
We do not believe that President [PER Vazquez  ] sanctions this development ; we also doubt that he will do anything to dissuade it. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment continued: Meanwhile , the [LOC U.S.  ] appears to have abandoned the field on this discussion and has said that the declassified documents speak for themselves . 
Scandals at [LOC U.S.  ] anti-terror detention facilities have not helped to promote engagement either . 
Nevertheless , there may come a time when we might need to defend ourselves against this assault on [LOC U.S.  ] credibility and intentions . 
We are not at that point yet , but the trials of [PER Bordaberry  ] and [PER Blanco  ] may make it necessary to respond . 
After all , our core interests in the region ( fostering economic growth , stability and democracy and fighting narcotics ) greatly depend on our reputation .
