( C ) Summary: A [LOC U.S.  ] interagency delegation met in [LOC Reykjavik  ] 3/30-31 with senior [MISC Icelandic  ] officials to describe the operational framework for the defense of [LOC Iceland  ] following the upcoming realignment of [ORG Naval Air Station Keflavik  ] ( [ORG NASKEF  ] ) . 
The [MISC Icelandic  ] delegation expressed keen interest in [LOC U.S.  ] proposals for enhanced security cooperation and pressed for additional details in the interest of generating a defense plan that could shortly be explained to the [MISC Icelandic  ] people . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] promised a [ORG EUCOM  ] briefing in April on a new plan for the defense of [LOC Iceland  ] , and assured the [ORG Icelanders  ] that the departure of fighter jets would not create a gap in coverage . 
Although the [ORG Icelanders  ] reiterated their disappointment at the [LOC U.S.  ] pullout , the tone was essentially cordial and cooperative , with no indication that the [ORG Icelanders  ] would seriously consider abrogation of the 1951 [ORG Defense Agreement  ] . 
That said , the [MISC Icelandic  ] trust that the [LOC U.S.  ] team sought to shore up is fragile , and maintaining a collaborative atmosphere will depend on our ability to come through with a reassuring and detailed [ORG EUCOM  ] plan . 
As the [ORG Icelanders  ] pointed out , we have yet to delve into the murky depths of base closure issues - another challenge State and [LOC DOD  ] must come to grips with shortly . 
End summary. -------------- [LOC U.S.  ] proposals -------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The Ambassador led a team from the [ORG Departments of State and Defense  ] that briefed senior [MISC Icelandic  ] foreign affairs and public safety officials in meetings held in [LOC Reykjavik  ] March 30-31 , two weeks after the [LOC U.S.  ] announcement that [ORG NASKEF  ] would close at the end of the fiscal year . 
Assuring the [ORG Icelanders  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to [MISC Icelandic  ] defense under the 55-year-old bilateral [ORG Defense Agreement  ] remained solid , the [LOC U.S.  ] briefers discussed concrete ways in which the [LOC U.S.  ] would counter 21st century threats minus a permanent on-island presence: -- Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense [PER James Townsend  ] provided the historical context for the shift in force posture as the [LOC U.S.  ] in [LOC Iceland  ] seeks to replace " a one-dimensional response to a threat that no longer exists . 
" -- [ORG Defense Intelligence Agency Senior Intelligence  ] Officer [PER James Danoy  ] enumerated mechanisms available for bilateral intelligence sharing and offered to help [LOC Reykjavik  ] " plug in " to the [ORG NATO  ] intelligence structure . 
-- [ORG Brigadier General Richard Mills  ] , [ORG EUCOM  ] Deputy Director for Plans and Operations , described [ORG European Command  ] 's contemporary mission and capabilities , laying out the ability of an expeditionary [ORG EUCOM  ] to respond rapidly and decisively to threats to [LOC Iceland  ] . 
-- [ORG Brigadier General  ] [PER Thomas Coon  ] , Mobilizations Assistant to the Director , [ORG Operational Plans and Joint Matters  ] , [ORG HQ USAF  ] , discussed how the [ORG Air Force  ] can support [ORG EUCOM  ] and [ORG NATO  ] in providing warfighting capabilities for [LOC Iceland  ] appropriate to the changing strategic environment . 
-- Responding to [LOC Iceland  ] , s request for information , Lt. Colonel [PER Troy Edgell  ] , [ORG Country Program  ] Director , [ORG Defense Security Cooperation Agency  ] , explained search and rescue ( [ORG SAR  ] ) procurement options via direct commercial sale and Foreign Military Sale as well as estimated [MISC Icelandic  ] requirements and costs . 
-- [ORG State Department Iceland Desk  ] Officer [PER John Maher  ] reviewed the recent history and potential growth of [LOC U.S.-Iceland  ] non-defense security cooperation. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) At the conclusion of the 3/31 session , EUR DAS [PER Mark Pekala  ] presented a 32-point distillation of concrete offers of strengthened cooperation made by the briefers , including: -- strategic intelligence partnership ( including through [MISC Icelandic  ] access to [ORG NATO  ] intel networks ; bilateral expert talks ; joint intelligence assessments ; intelligence officer training ; and a formal bilateral intelligence exchange agreement ) ; -- exercises , ship visits , short-term deployments , and combat air patrols from bases outside [LOC Iceland  ] ; -- [MISC Icelandic  ] orientation visits to [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG NATO  ] defense headquarters and installations ; -- [MISC Icelandic  ] participation in the Foreign Military Sales program to enable cost-effective procurement of [ORG SAR  ] assets ; -- non-military security training , e.g. on contraband enforcement , [MISC Internet  ] forensic investigations , transnational money laundering , natural disaster response , and emerging and pandemic disease response ; -- enhanced [ORG Coast Guard  ] exchanges and training , and partnering the [ORG U.S. Coast Guard  ] 's [LOC New England  ] region with [LOC Iceland  ] . 
( Note: This point amplified a presentation by [ORG U.S. Coast Guard  ] Commandant ADM [PER Thomas Collins  ] , who had met with [ORG Iceland Coast Guard  ] Director [PER Georg Larusson  ] and [ORG Ministry of Justice Deputy Permanent  ] Secretary [PER Stefan Eiriksson  ] at [ORG Keflavik  ] March 28 . 
End note . 
) ------------------ [MISC Icelandic  ] concerns ------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [MISC Icelandic  ] side was noncommittal on specific [LOC U.S.  ] suggestions and made none of its own . 
It did affirm its willingness to review an umbrella defense plan for [LOC Iceland  ] that [ORG European Command  ] expects to have ready by the end of April . 
Ambassador [PER Albert Jonsson  ] , Advisor to [LOC Iceland  ] 's Minister for Foreign Affairs and chair of the [MISC Icelandic  ] delegation , urged the [LOC U.S.  ] side to provide substantive and readily understandable proposals that the [ORG GOI  ] could put forward to the [MISC Icelandic  ] public as evidence that [LOC Washington  ] continues to guarantee [LOC Iceland  ] 's security . 
He also requested that the [LOC U.S.  ] provide , in the course of upcoming follow-up meetings: -- a clear picture of the size and shape of the [LOC U.S.  ] military footprint that will remain on the [LOC Agreed Area  ] at the end of September ( adding that some [LOC U.S.  ] presence would be important both practically and politically ) ; -- a timetable for bilateral discussions between now and the base closure ; -- information on how the [LOC U.S.  ] intends to maintain and monitor its military infrastructure on the [LOC Agreed Area  ] after September 30 ; -- information on how the [LOC U.S.  ] intends to carry out its responsibilities as host nation for the [ORG NATO  ] infrastructure on the base ; -- an answer as to whether the Navy special communications facility at [LOC Grindavik  ] will remain . 
( The [LOC U.S.  ] side responded that the tentative plan is to convert to a contractor-run facility . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [MISC Icelandic  ] MFA [ORG Defense Department  ] Director [PER Jon Egill Egilsson  ] asked the [LOC U.S.  ] to establish a mechanism for resolving base transition issues , including the timing of the handover of facilities on the [LOC Agreed Area  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] delegation promised responses to these [MISC Icelandic  ] concerns at the next round of consultations. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment: Over the course of two days of discussion , [PER Jonsson  ] went from complaints of [LOC Iceland  ] , s abandonment by the [LOC U.S.  ] to a more constructive acknowledgement that the [LOC U.S.  ] takes its responsibilities for [LOC Iceland  ] , s defense seriously and is deliberately working through the issues of responding decisively and quickly to potential threats . 
This counts as a significant step forward insofar as it clears the air for discussion of specific ways in which the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Iceland  ] can work together as modern strategic partners . 
That said , the [MISC Icelandic  ] trust has been bruised , and maintaining a collaborative atmosphere will depend on our ability to come through with a reassuring and detailed [ORG EUCOM  ] plan . 
We will also have to keep the pressure on the [ORG Icelanders  ] to become active partners in the areas of cooperation that the team outlined for them . 
Moreover , as [PER Jonsson  ] , s questions underscore , we have yet to delve into the murky depths of base closure issues - another challenge State and [LOC DOD  ] must come to grips with shortly .
