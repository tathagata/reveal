( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma  ] , President of the ruling [ORG African National Congress  ] ( [ORG ANC  ] ) party , is a controversial but not well understood personage who emerged from obscurity to where he now occupies the apex of [MISC South Africa’s  ] political pyramid . 
He is deeply loved and revered by his closest constituencies ; he is mistrusted by opposition parties ; and is hated by those here who believe he is “wrong for [MISC South Africa.”  ] Zuma’s nearly five decades of involvement with the [ORG ANC  ] , has brought him to this moment . 
[PER Zuma  ] is now poised to become the fourth post-apartheid President of [LOC South Africa  ] , following [PER Nelson Mandela  ] , [PER Thabo Mbeki  ] , and [PER Kgalema Motlanthe.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG National  ] and Provincial elections held on April 22 , 2009 resulted in the [ORG ANC  ] winning its fourth consecutive governing majority ( 65.9% ) . 
Under the [MISC South African  ] constitution , the [ORG Parliament  ] elects the state president ; thus the [ORG ANC  ] majority in [ORG Parliament  ] elected [PER Jacob Zuma  ] to be inaugurated in [LOC Pretoria  ] on May 9 , 2009 . 
This message weaves together various sources to provide a comprehensive look at the life and times of [PER Jacob Zuma  ] . 
Our goal is to dispel the caricatures that dominate the media and present a more realistic picture of the man who will soon lead the most dynamic emerging democracy in [LOC Africa  ] . 
This is the first in a series of three related cables . 
End Summary. ----------------- The [ORG Boyhood Years  ] ----------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Zuma  ] was born on April 12 , 1942 in the rural village of [LOC Inkandla  ] in the heart of [LOC Zululand  ] ( now , [PER Kwa-Zulu Natal  ] ) . 
One hundred or so years before Zuma’s birth , the [MISC Zulu War  ] leader [PER Shaka  ] led a bloody expansion of the [MISC Zulu  ] kingdom against other [MISC African  ] tribes , and fifty or so years before , the last [MISC Zulu War  ] was won by the [ORG British Empire  ] . 
Two centuries of colonial incursions into the heart of [LOC South Africa  ] and the advent of the [MISC Afrikaner Boers  ] into central and eastern territories reduced the [MISC Zulus  ] to dependency status in a racist system that placed all blacks at the bottom of a segregated system of governance . 
[PER Jacob Zuma  ] was born the first-born son of the second wife of a provincial policeman and had two full brothers and two full sisters . 
The first wife of his father had three boys and four girls . 
His father , whom he says he never saw , died while [PER Zuma  ] was very young. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The death of his father left his mother destitute and displaced her from her home in [LOC Inkandla  ] . 
She returned to her own village of [LOC Maphumulo  ] where she worked for low pay as a domestic . 
As the war ended , she relocated to a [LOC Durban  ] township and worked as a domestic to feed her children . 
Zuma’s childhood was spent between [LOC Durban  ] and the rural interior of [LOC Zululand  ] . 
In 1947 , the [ORG National Party  ] won the election and instituted apartheid and racial categories as the policy of the state . 
The [ORG Group Areas Act  ] , pass laws , [MISC Bantustans  ] , separate facilities and amenities were in place . 
The racial segregation of the colonial period became the law , and the authoritarian police state was prepared to enforce wit with violence . 
In reaction , the violent , chaotic relations between the state and the oppressed [MISC Africans  ] led to an atmosphere of periodic bloody riots , political suppression , torture , murder , strikes , townships in flames , Qsuppression , torture , murder , strikes , townships in flames , and widespread suffering. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Zuma  ] was forced to work odd jobs from a young age to supplement his mother’s meager income -- as a herd boy , a gardener , a domestic , in tea houses , and small shops . 
He faced the same problems of life of all [MISC Africans  ] in the apartheid state . 
In the rural , pastoralist cattle culture of the [MISC Zulu  ] , Zuma’s first job as a herd boy linked him to an ancient traditional occupation of [MISC African  ] boys throughout the continent . 
He once wrote , “I used to look after them ( the cows ) very well . 
That was the first time I was praised for a job well done.” <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Not unusual for the times , as an unregistered [MISC African  ] , [PER Zuma  ] only achieved schooling to [PER Form III  ] , or Fifth [LOC PRETORIA  ] 00000939 002.2 OF 003 Grade equivalent . 
However , friends and relatives recognized his hunger for learning and helped him with what they had learned . 
He claims to be self-taught and that he taught himself to read and write . 
In his teens , in 1955 , a cousin encouraged him to attend night school in [LOC Durban  ] . 
In this era , [MISC African  ] churches , trade unions , and civic organizations offered educational opportunities to their members that were otherwise lacking from the state . 
Throughout [LOC South Africa  ] and beyond , Zuma’s life exemplified the distinction between education and intelligence -- the former he lacked , the latter he had in abundance . 
In 1985 , in a biography penned for the [ORG Communist Party  ] , he said he was self-educated up to the [ORG Junior Certificate  ] level . 
Later in his life he said , “Education is education whether it is formal or not.” He continued , “I have done everything that the educated have done.” -------------------------- To Political Consciousness -------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG ANC  ] was established in 1912 as one of several civil agencies seeking to end racism and segregation and to protecting the human and civil rights of the [MISC African  ] majority . 
By mid-century , it had attracted the support of [MISC African  ] intellectuals and traditional leaders as well as the average neglected [MISC African  ] who was denied the rights of citizenship in the land of their birth . 
Zuma’s elder half brother from his father’s first wife was a secret member of the [ORG ANC  ] . 
A maternal uncle was a trade union activist . 
They talked to him about the struggle for equality and freedom , setting the spark for his developing political consciousness. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Zuma  ] actively took to politics , resistance , and activism as a young man of 17 years . 
He attended public and underground meetings where the goals of groups like the [ORG ANC  ] and the [MISC South African  ] [ORG Communist Party  ] ( [ORG SACP  ] ) were discussed . 
In 1958 , he hovered around the [ORG ANC Youth League  ] ( [ORG ANCYL  ] ) -- an organ made famous a decade earlier by the young revolutionary [PER Nelson Mandela  ] -- and in 1958 , [PER Zuma  ] joined the [ORG ANC  ] and its [ORG Youth League  ] . 
He said he was not an active participant , but he attended meetings and rallies . 
In 1959 , he joined the [MISC South African Council of Trade Unions  ] ( [ORG SACTU  ] ) with his brother and soon was involved in an anti-pass campaign in the [LOC Noxamana  ] district as well as in demonstrations opposing the [MISC Bantustan  ] policy . 
In these activities , he found a fraternity among like-minded groups that defined his life’s work. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In 1961 , the year [PER Nelson Mandela  ] was arrested and jailed , [PER Zuma  ] was 19 years old and committed to fighting apartheid . 
That year , in [LOC Durban  ] , he began courses with [ORG SACTU  ] on [MISC Marxism-Leninism  ] , the labor theory of value , and political discussions about colonialism , imperialism , the anti-colonial movement , and the nature of the struggle inside [LOC South Africa  ] . 
While a member of a political study group in 1962 , the year [PER Mandela  ] was sentenced to life in prison , [PER Zuma  ] was recruited into the militant armed wing of the [ORG ANC  ] -- [ORG Umkonto  ] wa Sizwe ( the [ORG Spear of the Nation  ] , aka “MK” ) . 
The following year , he was recruited into the [ORG SACP  ] , though in his words , he did “little party work.” It was Zuma’s associations with these organizations at this critical tipping point in [MISC South Africa’s  ] history that became the guiding commitment of his QAfrica’s history that became the guiding commitment of his life up until today. -------------------- Life in the Struggle -------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As an underground member of the banned [ORG ANC  ] and the [ORG SACP  ] , young [PER Jacob Zuma  ] was urged to go into exile , gain military training , and join the fight against apartheid . 
In June 1963 , the 21 year old [PER Zuma  ] was arrested with 45 other young comrades in [LOC Zeerust  ] , in the [MISC Transvaal  ] ( now [LOC North West Province  ] ) , as they were walking to [LOC Botswana  ] into self-imposed exile . 
He was detained for ninety days , then tried and sentenced to ten years in prison for “conspiracy to overthrow the government.” [PER Zuma  ] spent the next ten years incarcerated with many other political prisoners , including the senior [ORG ANC  ] leadership in prison such as [PER Nelson Mandela  ] , [PER Walter Sisulu  ] , [PER Govan Mbeki  ] , among other political prisoners at the infamous [LOC Robben Island  ] . 
While in [LOC Robben Island  ] , in what had become [LOC PRETORIA  ] 00000939 003.2 OF 003 the ANC’s graduate school , they discussed the [LOC U.S.  ] civil rights movement , the [MISC anti-Vietnam War  ] movement , the [MISC African  ] independence movement , and the global ideological contest of the [MISC Cold War.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Zuma  ] rarely discusses this period of his life in public , nor did his biography speak frankly about that experience , his relationships , and what he learned . 
He does say that many important people there engaged in serious political debates and disagreements , but he failed to say who they were or what they argued about . 
The only insight he provided says he held many responsible positions within [ORG ANC  ] structures at [LOC Robben Island  ] , he was a mentor for students , and at the end was Chairman of the Political Committee . 
In the culture of the revolutionary anti-apartheid movements , his presence at [LOC Robben Island  ] during [MISC Mandela’s  ] first decade there is the best possible “struggle credential” he could possibly have acquired to rise in the movement . 
Released from prison at the age of 32 in 1974 , [PER Zuma  ] immediately re-engaged the struggle with the [ORG ANC Natal  ] underground .
