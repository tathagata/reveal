Summary ---------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] continues to be a significant transit point for drugs entering [LOC Europe  ] ( especially cocaine ) , an important producer and exporter of synthetic drugs ( particularly Ecstasy - [ORG MDMA  ] ) , and a substantial consumer of most illicit drugs . 
The current [MISC Dutch  ] center-right coalition has made measurable progress in implementing a five-year strategy ( 2002-2006 ) against production , trade and consumption of synthetic drugs . 
According to the public prosecutor 's office , the number of Ecstasy tablets seized in the [LOC U.S.  ] that could be linked to the [LOC Netherlands  ] dropped to 0.2 million in 2004 from 1.1 million in 2003 and 2.5 million in 2002 . 
This number does not take into account the amount of Ecstasy seized in [LOC Canada  ] that is destined for the [LOC U.S.  ] Operational cooperation between [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] law enforcement agencies is excellent , despite some differences in approach and tactics . 
In July 2005 , ONDCP Director [PER John Walters  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] Health Minister [PER Hans Hoogervorst  ] signed an agreement to exchange scientific and demand reduction information . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] actively participates in DEA 's [LOC El Paso Information Center  ] ( [ORG EPIC  ] ) . 
The 100% controls at [LOC Schiphol  ] airport on inbound flights from the [LOC Caribbean  ] and some [MISC South American  ] countries have resulted in a dramatic decline in the number of drug couriers . 
[MISC Dutch  ] popular attitudes toward soft drugs remain tolerant to the point of indifference . 
The Government of the [LOC Netherlands  ] ( [ORG GONL  ] ) and the public view domestic drug use as a public health issue first and a law enforcement issue second . 
End summary. --------------------- II . 
Status of Country --------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
The central geographical position of the [LOC Netherlands  ] , with its modern transportation and communications infrastructure , one of the world 's busiest container port in [LOC Rotterdam  ] and one of [LOC Europe  ] 's busiest airports , makes the country an attractive operational area for international drug traffickers and money launderers . 
Production of Ecstasy and marijuana is significant ; there is also production of amphetamines and other synthetic drugs . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] also has a large ( legal ) chemical sector , making it an opportune location for criminals to obtain or produce precursor chemicals used to manufacture illicit drugs. ------------------------------------------ III . 
Country actions against drugs in 2005 ------------------------------------------ Policy Initiatives -------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
Major [MISC Dutch  ] government policy initiatives in 2005 include: <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
The [ORG National Crime Squad  ] ( [ORG Nationale Recherche  ] or [ORG NR  ] ) , which officially started functioning in January 2004 , had a very successful year in 2005 . 
Not only did it make the largest cocaine seizure ever in the [LOC Netherlands  ] , it also dismantled the largest Ecstasy laboratory ever found in the country ( see below for more details ) . 
Cannabis -------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
As announced in the 2004 Cannabis Letter , the [ORG Dutch Government  ] has given top priority to discouraging drug tourism and cannabis cultivation , particularly in the southern border regions . 
In November 2005 , [ORG Justice Minister Donner  ] sent the [ORG Second Chamber  ] an assessment of the government 's cannabis policy , highlighting the most important developments: - Maastricht shortly is expected to begin the trial project with special coffeeshop passes for its local residents . 
If successful , the experiment , which will limit the purchase soft drugs in [MISC Dutch  ] coffeeshops to [MISC Dutch  ] nationals , will be expanded ; - In October 2005 , [ORG Justice Minister Donner  ] proposed amending the [ORG Opium Act  ] to make it easier for local governments to close down premises where drugs are sold illegally . 
Currently , closure of such drug premises is possible with a judge 's order , but only if there is concrete evidence they are causing serious public nuisance ; - The public prosecutor 's office and the police in the southern provinces of [LOC Brabant  ] and [LOC Limburg  ] have started a pilot project targeting the criminal organizations behind illegal cannabis cultivation , rather than merely focusing on individual growers ; - In anticipation of parliamentary ratification of the bilateral law enforcement cooperation treaties with [LOC Germany  ] and [LOC Belgium  ] , practical measures have been taken to reduce drug trafficking in border regions . 
Cross-border surveillance has been intensified and license numbers of drug tourists are being exchanged ; - To implement the [ORG EU  ] framework decision on illegal drug trafficking of November 2004 , the Government currently is drafting a proposal raising the sentence for large-scale cannabis cultivation and illegal cannabis trafficking either or not in organized form from 4 to 6 years' imprisonment ; - The 2004 [ORG National Drug Monitor  ] , published by the [ORG Trimbos Addiction Institute  ] in April 2005 , showed that recent ( within the last-month ) cannabis use among young people aged 12-18 dropped from 11% in 1996 to 9% in 2003 . 
Lifetime prevalence ( ever-used ) of cannabis in this age group dropped from 22% to 19% over the same period . 
In 2004 , [ORG Trimbos  ] began a 3-year mass- media publicity campaign , subsidized by the [ORG Health Ministry  ] , to discourage cannabis use among young people ; - The average [ORG THC  ] content in [MISC Dutch-grown  ] cannabis ( Nederwiet ) was 20% in 2003-2004 , and appears to be stabilizing at between 17 and 20% . 
The [ORG State Institute for Health and Environment  ] ( [ORG RIVM  ] ) has been ordered to investigate acute health risks of cannabis with high [ORG THC  ] levels . 
Results of this study are expected in March 2006. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
A July 2005 study estimated the total number of coffeeshops in the [LOC Netherlands  ] at 737 at the end of 2004 , down from 754 in 2002 . 
Only 22% of the 483 [MISC Dutch  ] municipalities allow coffeeshops within their cities - 70% do not allow any at all . 
Half of all coffeeshops are located in the five largest cities . 
On average , coffeeshops are controlled four times per year , and criteria for operating such shops usually are well observed. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
In a November 28 , 2005 letter to the [ORG Second Chamber  ] , Health Minister [PER Hoogervorst  ] stated that legal sales of medicinal cannabis by pharmacies have largely failed . 
He said the policy to allow medicinal sales in pharmacies could only be effective if an official cannabis-based medicine were registered . 
[PER Hoogervorst  ] intends to end the experiment if the pharmaceutical industry fails to develop such a medicine within one year . 
Since March 2003 , doctors have been allowed to prescribe medicinal cannabis for their chronically ill patients . 
The [ORG Health Ministry  ] 's [ORG Bureau for Medicinal Cannabis  ] buys the cannabis from two official growers , controls quality and organizes the distribution . 
Cocaine Trafficking ------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
In July 2005 , the [ORG Justice Ministry  ] expanded prosecutions of [MISC South American  ] and [LOC Caribbean  ] cocaine couriers at [LOC Schiphol  ] airport . 
Previously , the government only prosecuted couriers carrying 3 kilos or more of cocaine ; couriers carrying smaller quantities were sent home . 
Under the new policy , couriers carrying 1.5 or more kilos are prosecuted . 
Government officials expect to prosecute all couriers , regardless of quantity carried , by January 2006 . 
This has become possible because of the dramatic decline in the number of couriers due to the stricter controls . 
During a [ORG Justice Ministry  ] budget debate in November 2005 , the [ORG Second Chamber  ] questioned the high amount of money spent annually on the 100% controls: 27 million euros by [ORG Justice  ] , and 6.5 million euros each by the [ORG KMAR  ] military police and Customs . 
In early 2006 , the [ORG Justice Ministry  ] will publish an assessment of the [LOC Schiphol  ] drug policy , including a long-term plan. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
In September 2005 , [ORG Justice Minister Donner  ] signed agreements with his [MISC Colombian  ] and [MISC Venezuelan  ] counterparts on intensified cooperation in combating cocaine trafficking in the regions. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
In June 2005 , the [ORG Justice Ministry  ] agreed to resume sharing the list of all blacklisted [LOC Schiphol  ] couriers with [ORG DEA  ] 's [ORG El Paso Intelligence Center  ] ( [ORG EPIC  ] ) after a two-month hiatus due to [MISC Dutch  ] concerns over privacy protections . 
To date , approximately 5,300 courier names have been provided to [ORG EPIC.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
In August 2005 , the [LOC Rotterdam  ] police seized 4,500 kilos of cocaine - the largest cocaine seizure ever in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
The cocaine , hidden inside two large steel cable spools , was worth an estimated 273 million dollars . 
The investigation involved close cooperation with [ORG DEA  ] offices in [LOC Spain  ] , [LOC Belgium  ] , and the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
Cooperation among [MISC Dutch  ] , [MISC German  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] police led to the seizure of 1,650 kilos of cocaine at the Port of [LOC Rotterdam  ] in November . 
The cocaine , with an estimated street value of 60 million dollars , was hidden in tins of asparagus and red peppers . 
Ecstasy --------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
In July 2005 , [ORG Justice Minister Donner  ] submitted to the [ORG Second Chamber  ] an interim evaluation of the Government 's 2002- 2006 Ecstasy action plan . 
The report , which covers the period up to 2004 , indicated positive effects , such as increased seizures , suspects , and completed investigations . 
( For more details , see para on cultivation/production . 
) <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
On November 29 , 2005 , the [ORG National Crime Squad  ] ( [ORG NR  ] ) and the [MISC FIOD-ECD  ] fiscal and economic investigation service dismantled the largest Ecstasy lab ever found in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
The professional lab was found in [LOC Nederweert  ] ( southern [LOC Limburg  ] province ) , and was estimated to have had a production capacity of 20 million Ecstasy tablets . 
The police also found more than 300 liters of [LOC PMK  ] and a small quantity of [ORG MDMA  ] powder and amphetamine . 
In addition , more than 50,000 liters of chemicals were discovered at a different location . 
Six people were arrested , all of them from [LOC Limburg  ] province . 
The investigation , which began in May 2005 , was carried out in close cooperation with [MISC German  ] and [MISC Belgian  ] authorities . 
This was the first Ecstasy lab discovered in 2005 ; previously , only amphetamine laboratories had been found this year . 
Heroin Experiment ----------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
In June 2005 , [ORG Ministers Donner  ] and [PER Hoogervorst  ] informed the [ORG Second Chamber  ] that projects providing free heroin to hard-core drug addicts would be expanded to another 15 municipalities , for which 7 million euros would be made available over the next few years . 
[LOC Amsterdam  ] , [LOC Rotterdam  ] , The [ORG Hague  ] , [ORG Utrecht  ] , [ORG Groningen  ] and [PER Heerlen  ] already have such projects , which include a total of 300 addicts . 
In total , 980 addicts could be treated with the extra money . 
Accomplishments --------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
The new [ORG National Crime Squad  ] ( [ORG NR  ] ) has proved very effective in drug investigations , and resulted in closer cooperation with the [ORG DEA  ] . 
In July 2005 , the national police ( [ORG KLPD  ] ) assigned a liaison officer to [LOC China  ] to work on joint precursor chemical investigations . 
In addition to working directly with the [MISC Chinese  ] , the [LOC Netherlands  ] is an active participant in the [LOC INCB/PRISM  ] project 's taskforce . 
[ORG Law Enforcement Efforts  ] ----------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
Overall the [ORG Health Ministry  ] coordinates drug policy , while the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] is responsible for law enforcement . 
Matters relating to local government and the police are the responsibility of the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] . 
At the municipal level , policy is coordinated in tripartite consultations among the mayor , the chief public prosecutor and the police. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
The [ORG Dutch Opium Act  ] punishes possession , commercial distribution , production , import , and export of all illicit drugs . 
Drug use , however , is not an offense . 
The act distinguishes between hard drugs that have unacceptable risks ( e.g. , heroin , cocaine , Ecstasy ) , and soft drugs ( cannabis products ) . 
Trafficking in hard drugs is prosecuted vigorously and dealers are subject to a prison sentence of up to 12 years . 
When trafficking takes place on an organized scale , the sentence is increased by one-third ( up to 16 years ) . 
Sales of small amounts of cannabis products ( under five grams ) are tolerated ( i.e. , not prosecuted , even though technically illegal ) in coffeeshops operating under regulated conditions ( no minors on premises , no alcohol sales , no hard drug sales , no advertising , and not creating a public nuisance ) . <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
The [ORG Dutch National Police  ] ( [ORG KLPD  ] ) and the [ORG National Prosecutors  ] office continue to give high priority to combating the illegal drug trade . 
The new [ORG National Crime Squad  ] ( [ORG Nationale Recherche  ] - [ORG NR  ] ) , a branch of the [ORG KLPD  ] , became operational on January 1 , 2004 ; two of the [ORG NR  ] 's primary missions are investigating of smuggling and cross border trade in cocaine and heroin , and investigating the production and trade of synthetic drugs . 
As part of the bilateral Next Steps law enforcement negotiations , [ORG DEA  ] has obtained increased access to the [ORG NR  ] office in The [ORG Hague  ] , which focuses on cocaine investigations , and is working toward a similar relationship with the [ORG NR  ] office in [LOC Helmond  ] , which focuses on synthetic drugs . 
In September 2004 , [ORG DEA  ] assigned an additional special agent to The [ORG Hague Country Office  ] , increasing the office 's manpower to six , the largest it has ever been. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
In April 2005 , the [MISC Dutch  ] participated in the [ORG International Drug Enforcement Conference  ] ( [ORG IDEC  ] ) in [LOC Santiago  ] , [LOC Chile  ] . 
This conference , involving approximately 50 nations , meets to share drug intelligence , identify joint targets and assist in coordinating international drug trafficking investigations . 
In July 2005 , the [ORG KLPD  ] assigned a liaison officer to [LOC Beijing  ] , [LOC China  ] to facilitate joint cooperation on precursor chemical investigations . 
In November 2005 , the [MISC Dutch  ] hosted the [ORG Synthetic Drug Enforcement Conference  ] ( [ORG SYNDEC II  ] ) , which focused on ways to increase international cooperation on synthetic drug and precursor chemical investigations. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
All foreign law enforcement assistance requests continue to be sent to the [ORG DIN  ] ( [ORG International Network Service  ] ) , a division of the [ORG NR  ] . 
The [ORG DIN  ] has assigned two liaison officers to assist [ORG DEA  ] and other [LOC U.S.  ] law enforcement agencies . 
Since the reorganization into the [ORG NR  ] , the [ORG DIN  ] has allowed [ORG DEA  ] and other liaison officers to contact one of the five [ORG NR  ] offices directly with requests . 
In addition , [ORG DEA  ] has been allowed to contact regional police offices on a case-by- case basis . 
This policy has permitted better coordination during ongoing enforcement actions , such as controlled deliveries and undercover operations . 
Under [MISC Dutch  ] law enforcement policy , prosecutors still control most aspects of an investigation . 
[MISC Dutch  ] police officers must get prosecutor concurrence to share police-to-police information directly with foreign liaison officers . 
This can hamper the quick sharing of information , which could be used proactively in an ongoing investigation . 
However , the quick sharing of police- to-police information is improving as a result of the increased access for [ORG DEA  ] agents with [ORG NR  ] units . 
This improved information sharing led to the seizure of approximately 4,500 kilograms of cocaine and the dismantling of a [MISC Colombian  ] cocaine transportation cell operating in the [LOC Netherlands  ] and [LOC Spain  ] in September 2005 . 
[MISC Dutch  ] law enforcement has also become much more willing to undertake controlled delivery operations with [ORG DEA  ] . 
In fiscal year 2004 , the [MISC Dutch  ] did not accept any requests from [ORG DEA  ] for controlled delivery operations . 
In FY 2005 , the [MISC Dutch  ] and [ORG DEA  ] conducted 10 inbound controlled deliveries of cocaine . 
This trend is continuing with three controlled delivery operations attempted so far in FY 2006 . 
Most of these controlled deliveries are small amounts of cocaine ( less than five kilograms ) contained in parcels being sent from [LOC South America  ] or the [LOC Caribbean.  ] <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
The 100% controls on inbound flights from the [LOC Caribbean  ] and some [MISC South American  ] countries continue at [LOC Schiphol Airport  ] . 
Currently couriers with more than 1.5 kilograms of cocaine are prosecuted . 
The [ORG Dutch Ministry of Justice  ] anticipates prosecuting all cocaine couriers , regardless of quantity , at [LOC Schiphol  ] beginning in January 2006 . 
The manpower required to conduct these 100% controls remains a major monetary expense and logistical challenge for the authorities at [LOC Schiphol  ] . 
The program negatively affects the number of flights targeted for outbound checks , and as a result , the number of outbound drug couriers going to the [LOC United States  ] arrested at [LOC Schiphol  ] remains low . 
Corruption ---------- <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] government is committed to fighting national and international corruption . 
It does not encourage or facilitate illicit production or distribution of narcotic or psychotropic drugs or other controlled substances , or the laundering of proceeds from illegal drug transactions . 
No senior official of the [MISC Dutch  ] government engages in , encourages or facilitates the illicit production or distribution of such drugs or substances , or the laundering of proceeds from illegal drug transactions . 
Press reports of low-level law enforcement corruption appear from time to time but the problem is not believed to be widespread or systemic . 
In November 2005 , 140 officers of the special [ORG Schiphol CargoHarc  ] drug team staged a preventive security control action of the airport 's baggage basement , searching for drugs and other potential criminal activities . 
The action did not result in any arrests . 
Agreements and Treaties ----------------------- <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] is party to the 1988 [ORG UN Drug Convention  ] , the 1971 [ORG UN Convention  ] on [ORG Psychotropic Substances  ] , the 1961 [ORG Single Convention  ] on [ORG Narcotic Drugs  ] , and the 1972 Protocol amending the [ORG Single Convention  ] . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] is a member of the [ORG UN Commission  ] on [ORG Narcotics Drugs  ] and the major donors group of the [ORG UNODC  ] . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] is a leading member of the [ORG Dublin Group  ] of countries coordinating drug-related assistance . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] ratified the [ORG UN Convention  ] on [ORG Transnational Organized Crime  ] in 2004 , and ratified the protocols on trafficking in persons and migrant smuggling in <a id='par2005' href='#par2005'>¶</a>2005 . 
Cultivation and Production -------------------------- <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
Although commercial ( indoor ) cultivation of hemp is banned , about 80 percent of the [MISC Dutch  ] cannabis market is [MISC Dutch-grown  ] marijuana ( [MISC Nederwiet  ] ) . 
A 2004 national police report of the [MISC Dutch  ] drug market estimated the [LOC Netherlands  ] has between 17,000-22,000 cannabis plantations producing about 68,000-99,000 kilos of [MISC Nederwiet  ] . 
In 2004 , 2,261 hemp plantations were dismantled , up from 1,867 in 2003 . 
Although the [MISC Dutch  ] government has given top priority to the investigation and prosecution of large-scale commercial cultivation of [MISC Nederwiet  ] , tolerated coffeeshops appear to create the demand for such cultivation . 
To end the controversial policy of allowing front-door cannabis sales in coffeeshops but banning back-door deliveries , a [ORG Second Chamber  ] majority urged the Government in October 2005 to approve a trial program regulating cannabis cultivation . 
Proponents , including the [LOC Mayors  ] of [LOC Amsterdam  ] and [LOC Maastricht  ] , argued that the measure would end large-scale home cultivation , in which organized crime plays an important role . 
Justice Minister [PER Donner  ] and Interior Minister [PER Remkes  ] strongly opposed the experiment on the grounds that it would violate international treaties to which the [LOC Netherlands  ] is committed. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] remains one of the largest producers of synthetic drugs , although the [ORG National Crime Squad  ] ( [ORG NR  ] ) has noted a production shift to [LOC Eastern Europe  ] . 
According to the [ORG NR  ] , there also appears to be a shift from [MISC Ecstasy  ] to amphetamine production . 
According to a July 2005 report by the [ORG National Crime Squad  ] ( [ORG NR  ] ) , 197 [MISC Ecstasy  ] suspects were arrested in 2004 , down from 214 in 2003 . 
The [ORG NR  ] seized 11,120 liters of chemical precursors compared to 11,453 liters in 2003 . 
The [ORG NR  ] completed 60 criminal investigations in 2004 and 40 in 2003 . 
The Fiscal and [ORG Economic Investigation Service  ] ( [MISC FIOD-ECD  ] ) completed 23 investigations in 2004 and 19 in 2003 . 
The total number of [MISC Ecstasy  ] tablets with an alleged [MISC Dutch  ] connection confiscated by [LOC U.S.  ] authorities continued to drop from almost 2.3 million tablets in 2002 , and 1.1 million in 2003 , to about 0.2 million in <a id='par2004' href='#par2004'>¶</a>2004 . 
The number of registered [MISC Ecstasy  ] tablets seized in the [LOC Netherlands  ] totaled 5.6 million in 2004 , compared to 5.4 million in 2003. <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
According to the same [ORG NR  ] report , 2004 drug seizures around the world that could be related to the [LOC Netherlands  ] involved more than 10 million [ORG MDMA  ] tablets ( 2003: 12.9 million ) and more than 1,000 kilos ( 2003: 870 kilos ) of [ORG MDMA  ] powder . 
[ORG MDMA  ] ( powder and paste ) seizures in the [LOC Netherlands  ] in 2004 dropped to 303 kilos from 435 kilos in 2003 . 
The number of dismantled production sites in the [LOC Netherlands  ] for synthetic drugs dropped to 29 in 2004 from 37 in 2003 . 
Of the 29 production sites , 13 were for amphetamine and 11 for [MISC Ecstasy  ] production , and 5 were meant for [MISC Ecstasy  ] tableting . 
Drug Flow/Transit ----------------- <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] remains an important point of entry for drugs to [LOC Europe  ] , especially cocaine . 
According to a November 2003 report by the [ORG National Crime Squad  ] , an estimated 40,000- 50,000 kilos of cocaine are smuggled annually into the [LOC Netherlands  ] , of which about 20,000 kilos enter via [LOC Schiphol  ] and the remainder via seaports and road from [LOC Spain  ] ( [MISC Dutch  ] cocaine use is estimated at 4,000-8,000 kilos annually ) . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] government has stepped up border controls to combat the flow of drugs , including the successful [ORG Schiphol Action Plan  ] . 
Cocaine seizures in the [LOC Netherlands  ] dropped to 12,387 kilos in 2004 , of which about 8,155 kilos were seized at [LOC Schiphol  ] . 
The government has expanded the number of container scanners in the port of [LOC Rotterdam  ] and at [LOC Schiphol  ] airport . 
Controls of highways and international trains connecting the [LOC Netherlands  ] to neighboring countries have also been intensified . 
Money Laundering ---------------- <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] participates in the [ORG FATF  ] . 
Forty separate anti-money laundering measures recommended by [ORG FATF  ] have been integrated in the financial sector . 
Additionally , legislation making money laundering a separate , stand-alone , offense became effective in 2002 . 
( Septel ) Asset Seizures -------------- <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have signed the [ORG Strasbourg Convention  ] and have drawn up national legislation to enable courts to confiscate the proceeds of drug-related crime . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and the [LOC Netherlands  ] have an asset seizure agreement . 
Extradition and [ORG Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and the [LOC Netherlands  ] have fully operational extradition and mutual legal assistance agreements ( MLAT ) . 
Some defense attorneys , however , have argued that suspects who may be accused in the [LOC United States  ] of terrorist offences should not be extradited because of the way they may be treated in the [LOC U.S.  ] Courts have been receptive to this argument . 
Demand Reduction ---------------- <a id='par31' href='#par31'>¶</a>31 . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] has a wide variety of demand and harm- reduction programs , reaching about 80 percent of the country 's 26,000-30,000 opiate addicts . 
The number of opiate addicts is low compared to other [ORG EU  ] countries ( 2.6 per 1,000 inhabitants ) ; the number has stabilized over the past few years ; the average age has risen to 40 ; and the number of overdose deaths related to opiates has stabilized at between 30 and 50 per year . 
Needle supply and exchange programs have kept the incidence of [MISC HIV  ] infection among intravenous drug users relatively low . 
Of the addicts known to the addiction care organizations , 75 percent regularly use methadone. <a id='par32' href='#par32'>¶</a>32 . 
According to the 2004 [ORG National Drug Monitor  ] , the out- patient treatment centers registered some 29,173 drug users seeking treatment for their addiction in 2003 , compared to 27,768 in 2002 . 
The number of cannabis addicts seeking treatment rose to 4,485 in 2003 from 3,701 in 2002 , but the number of opiate addicts seeking treatment dropped from 16,043 in 2002 to 15,195 in 2003 . 
Statistics from drug treatment services show a sharp increase in the number of people seeking help for cocaine addiction , from 6,103 in 2000 to 9,216 in 2003 . 
About 65 percent of addicts seeking help for cocaine problems are crack cocaine users. <a id='par33' href='#par33'>¶</a>33 . 
Drug use among students ages 12-18 , 1999 and 2003 ( percent reporting life-time ( ever ) use and last-month use ) Life-time use Last-month use ------------- -------------- 1999 2003 1999 2003 Cannabis 20.0 19.0 9.0 9.0 Cocaine 2.8 2.2 1.2 0.8 Heroin 0.8 1.1 0.4 0.5 Amphetamine 2.8 2.2 1.1 0.8 Ecstasy 3.9 2.9 1.4 1.2 ( [ORG Source: National Drug Monitor  ] 2004 , [ORG Trimbos Institute Prevention  ] ---------- <a id='par34' href='#par34'>¶</a>34 . 
Drug prevention programs are organized through a network of local , regional and national institutions . 
Schools are targeted in efforts to discourage drug use , while national campaigns are conducted in the mass media to reach the broader public . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] requires school instruction on the dangers of alcohol and drugs as part of the health education curriculum . 
The [ORG Netherlands Institute of Mental Health and Addiction  ] ( the [ORG Trimbos Institute  ] ) has developed a project in the field of alcohol and drugs in the context of teaching healthy living in classrooms . 
About 75 percent of [MISC Dutch  ] secondary schools participate in the project . 
In 2004 , the [ORG Health Ministry  ] and the [ORG Trimbos Institute  ] launched a three-year cannabis information campaign warning young people in the 12-18 age group about the health risks .

[LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] law enforcement agencies maintained excellent operational cooperation , with principal attention given to countering the [LOC Netherlands'  ] role as a key source country for MDMA/Ecstasy entering the [LOC U.S.  ] The [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy in The [LOC Hague  ] has made the fight against the [MISC Ecstasy  ] threat one of its highest priorities . 
[MISC Dutch  ] law enforcement has dramatically improved its acceptance of controlled delivery operations with the [ORG DEA  ] , but continues to resist use of criminal infiltrants in investigations of drug traffickers . 
They are also reluctant to admit the involvement of large , international drug organizations in the local drug trade and do not use their asset forfeiture rules often . 
The fourth bilateral law enforcement talks , which were held in [LOC Washington  ] in April 2005 , resulted in additional agreements to the Agreed [MISC Steps  ] list of action to enhance law enforcement cooperation in fighting drug trafficking. <a id='par36' href='#par36'>¶</a>36 . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and the [LOC Netherlands  ] cooperate closely on law enforcement activities throughout the [MISC Kingdom of the Netherlands  ] .

We expect [MISC U.S.-Dutch  ] bilateral law enforcement cooperation to intensify in 2006 . 
The bilateral Agreed [MISC Steps  ] process will continue to promote closer cooperation in international investigations , including Ecstasy and money laundering cases . 
In particular , increased access for [ORG DEA  ] agents to [ORG NR  ] drug units is expected to result in enhanced police-to-police information sharing and coordination .

The [MISC Dutch  ] synthetic drug unit , which now is part of the [ORG National Crime Squad  ] , will continue to make concrete progress . 
The stationing of the [MISC Dutch  ] liaison officer in [LOC China  ] in July 2005 is expected to increase cooperation among the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC China  ] and the [LOC Netherlands  ] on precursor chemicals . 
We have also noticed improved and expedited handling of extradition requests. ------------- <a id='parV' href='#parV'>¶</a>V .
