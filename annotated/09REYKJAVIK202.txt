REYKJAVIK 176 Classified By: [ORG CDA  ] SAM WATSON FOR REASONS 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: Recent actions by the government of [LOC Iceland  ] ( [ORG GOI  ] ) , including a proposal to introduce a significant energy tax in the 2010 budget bill ( reftel B ) , have raised concerns about the current environment for foreign investors . 
Implementing significant tax increases ex-post-facto , for example , could disadvantage [MISC American  ] companies currently operating in [LOC Iceland  ] and significantly hinder [LOC Iceland  ] 's ability to attract needed foreign direct investment ( [ORG FDI  ] ) . 
Over the past few weeks , the Charge d'Affaires ( [ORG CDA  ] ) has conveyed such concerns to various high-ranking members of the [ORG GOI  ] including: representatives in the offices of the Prime Minister and President as well as the [ORG Ministers  ] of [ORG Economic Affairs , Environment  ] , Finance , [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] and [ORG External Trade  ] , and Industry . 
[ORG GOI  ] officials appear to understand the message and assured [ORG CDA  ] that [LOC Iceland  ] wants to take steps necessary to attract [ORG FDI  ] while also taking into consideration the nation 's fiscal challenges . 
Now the [ORG GOI  ] has , in fact , walked back the proposed energy tax and is engaging industry leaders in the process . 
END SUMMARY . 
The [ORG Aluminum Industry  ] --------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The aluminum industry has been one of the more vocal opponents of several recent [ORG GOI  ] actions and expressed concern that the [ORG GOI  ] wants to kick it out of the country . 
In recent months , government decisions have resulted in the cessation of plans to build a smelter in [LOC Bakki  ] and a delay in construction of a new smelter in [LOC Helguvik  ] . 
Plans to expand a third smelter in [LOC Straumsvik  ] are also being called into question . 
In addition , the first draft of the 2010 budget bill proposed implementing an energy tax of one [MISC ISK  ] per kWh ( 0.8 cents ) for electricity usage . 
This proposed tax has generated anger among many businesses , but particularly the aluminum industry because it chose to locate in [LOC Iceland  ] for the low power costs and it accounts for about 80% of the country 's electricity consumption . 
Executives from the two [MISC American-owned  ] aluminum smelters , [ORG Alcoa  ] and [ORG Century Aluminum  ] , expressed concern to [ORG CDA  ] that such action could violate their existing investment agreements and significantly reduce the companies' profitability . 
They estimate the tax at one [MISC ISK  ] per kWh would create an additional expense of 13.2 billion [MISC ISK  ] ( $106 million ) per year . 
Equally troubling , said aluminum representatives , is that they first learned about the proposed tax in the newspaper . 
Communication with the government , they complained , has been virtually non-existent since the new government ( with the pro-environment anti-aluminum Left Greens as a partner ) took control earlier this year. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG GOI  ] officials across the board , including the Minister of Environment [PER Svandis Svavarsdottir  ] , have told [ORG CDA  ] that they do not want the aluminum companies to leave [LOC Iceland  ] . 
All recognize the importance of this sector as one of the country 's largest employers and largest export industries . 
( Note: the aluminum industry accounts for almost 42 percent of exported goods and 29 percent of overall export revenues for [LOC Iceland  ] . 
End note . 
) Their size and importance is one reason the aluminum industry should not be excluded from rebuilding the country , said Minister of Industry [PER Katrin Juliusdottir  ] . 
Minister of Finance , [PER Steingrimur Sigfusson  ] , also acknowledged that it would be healthy for some aluminum projects to go forward as they would create additional jobs and revenue for the state . 
( Note: the Minister of Finance was referring to continuation of projects already under way - construction of a new smelter for [LOC U.S.  ] company [ORG Century Aluminum  ] and expansion of the [MISC Swiss-Canadian  ] [ORG Alcan  ] smelter . 
End note . 
) Justification for Tax Increase ------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The Minister of [ORG Economic Affairs  ] , [PER Gylfi Magnusson  ] , told [ORG CDA  ] that increasing tax revenue is essential to close the fiscal gap and stimulate the economy . 
He noted that the tax base has eroded in the last year , especially in the corporate sector . 
Aluminum companies argue that the proposed energy tax of one [MISC ISK  ] per kWh ( 0.8 cents ) targets the industry unfairly and will force the businesses to cut back on operations . 
( Note: this tax would apply to all consumers of electricity , not just the aluminum industry . 
Aluminum companies , however , would shoulder the majority of the tax burden since they utilize about 80% of the nation 's electricity . 
End note . 
) Minister of Industry [PER Juliusdottir  ] , however , asserted that the [ORG GOI  ] will not allow taxes to suffocate industries . 
She and other [ORG Ministers  ] told [ORG CDA  ] that the one [MISC ISK  ] per kWh ( 0.8 cents ) mentioned in the first draft of the budget had merely been an example , but was too high . 
As of November 9 , the [ORG GOI  ] is proposing a tax of 12 aurar ( 0.1 cents ) per kWh . 
( Note: Reykjavik households pay about seven to eight [MISC ISK  ] ( about six cents ) per kWh for electricity , and the aluminum companies pay undisclosed lower amounts . 
Energy prices for aluminum firms differ based on agreements signed with the government . 
End note . 
) Finance Minister [PER Sigfusson  ] reiterated that all must share the burden of rebuilding the economy , and while aluminum companies may not be happy about it the [ORG GOI  ] hopes the final solution will be considered fair . 
Foreign Minister [PER Skarphedinsson  ] assured [ORG CDA  ] that he was working to broker a compromise that would enable the firms to continue to operate in [LOC Iceland  ] and not close off potential future investment into the country . 
Future Direction ---------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOI  ] recognizes the importance of creating a more comprehensive , standardized environment to attract [ORG FDI  ] . 
Minister of Industry [PER Juliusdottir  ] told [ORG CDA  ] that she intends to create a clearer , more general framework for [ORG FDI  ] rather than negotiating with companies on a case-by-case basis . 
Investors should know what to expect , she said , regarding the legal environment , financial environment and taxation . 
Simultaneously , Minister of Finance [PER Sigfusson  ] is working on creating a long-term vision for the country 's future development . 
He acknowledged the need to harmonize incentives and the duration of investment agreements , and is considering introducing possible deductions for new investment and incentives for start-up periods . 
Last week , [PER Sigfusson  ] introduced two bills to parliament providing incentives for [MISC Icelandic  ] high tech and research and development companies . 
Comment ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG GOI  ] officials understand the importance of [ORG FDI  ] in rebuilding the nation 's economy . 
Though the government has been slow to implement changes to create an attractive investment climate , it recognizes that steps need to be taken to attract , or keep , investment . 
Plans to create a clearer , comprehensive framework for [ORG FDI  ] and to introduce incentives are two examples . 
In addition , as [ORG CDA  ] stressed in meetings with the [ORG Ministers  ] , it is important that key industry players be included in process . 
The government appears to have accepted the notion as several aluminum representatives , who earlier approached the [ORG Embassy  ] in frustration after being kept out of the discussions , recently thanked the [ORG Embassy  ] for getting them a seat at the table and nudging the government away from the initial tax proposal . 
The reduction of the proposed energy tax from one [MISC ISK  ] ( 0.8 cents ) to 12 aurar ( 0.1 cents ) resulted from consultative talks between the [ORG GOI  ] and the [ORG Association of Icelandic Employers  ] , of which the aluminum companies are the largest members . 
While current plans and proposals are still subject to change , the ideas under consideration and initiation of dialogue are steps in the right direction for [LOC U.S.  ] firms .
