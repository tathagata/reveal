( C ) [MISC Chilean  ] President [PER Michelle Bachelet  ] 's June 23-24 visit to [LOC Washington  ] represents an opportunity to broaden and deepen the " equal partnership " we enjoy with one of the hemisphere , s most successful democracies . 
[LOC Chile  ] is off to a strong start with the [ORG Obama Administration  ] . 
The Vice President , s March visit to [LOC Chile  ] powerfully signaled [LOC Washington  ] 's interest in engaging with [LOC Chile  ] and the region , while Presidents [PER Bachelet  ] and [ORG Obama  ] worked effectively together at the [MISC Summit of the Americas  ] . 
Meanwhile , in early June , [LOC Chile  ] played a constructive role in backing the [LOC U.S.  ] resolution on [LOC Cuba  ] 's conditional re-entry into the [ORG OAS  ] . 
President [PER Bachelet  ] is keenly interested in forging even stronger bonds with the [ORG Obama Administration  ] . 
The visit will offer an opportunity to review regional developments with a trusted partner and deepen cooperation on new issues ranging from renewable energy to assistance for [LOC Haiti  ] and [ORG Central America.  ] --------------------------------------------- --- Sky High Approval Ratings for President [PER Bachelet  ] --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [LOC Chile  ] 's first female president , [PER Michelle Bachelet  ] , is wildly popular , enjoying the highest approval rating ever ( 76% ) of any [MISC Chilean  ] president . 
Under talented Finance Minister [PER Andres Velasco  ] , [LOC Chile  ] has responded effectively to the global financial crisis , drawing down on [LOC Chile  ] 's sovereign wealth funds to finance a [ORG USD  ] 4 billion economic stimulus program featuring new jobs , labor subsidies for youth workers , and targeted tax cuts . 
Despite her economic success , [PER Bachelet  ] views her legacy primarily in the social sphere . 
Her initiatives have expanded [LOC Chile  ] 's privatized pension scheme to vulnerable lower-income populations , offered free day care and basic nutrition for low-income families , expanded access to health care , and strengthened public education. -------------------------------------------- A Tight Race Ahead: December 2009 Elections -------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Despite President [PER Bachelet  ] 's popularity , the ruling center-left [ORG Concertacion  ] coalition faces a tight race in December 's presidential and parliamentary elections . 
The President is constitutionally precluded from immediate re-election , and candidates from the two main political coalitions are at a loss as to how to portray themselves . 
[MISC Chileans  ] are tired of 20 years of [ORG Concertacion  ] rule , some inefficiency and mismanagement in government , and the same faces dominating [MISC Chilean  ] politics . 
On the other hand , President [PER Bachelet  ] is enormously popular , her policies are generally well-regarded , and [MISC Chileans  ] are grateful that the financial crisis has not hit their country harder . 
Billionaire entrepreneur [PER Sebastian Pinera  ] , representing the center-right [ORG Alianza  ] coalition , has a 10 to 15 point lead over likely [ORG Concertacion  ] candidate [PER Eduardo Frei  ] , a Senator and former President ( 1994-2000 ) . 
Upstart challenger [PER Marco Enriquez-Ominami  ] , a 36-year old legislator , is bucking the [ORG Concertacion  ] establishment to run a surprisingly successful independent candidacy , but it is more style than substance in our estimation . 
Either of the two leading candidates would be strong partners for the [ORG Obama Administration.  ] ------------------------------------- A Bruised Economy Poised for Recovery ------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Chile  ] is fortunate to be in a strong economic position to face the global economic downturn . 
The country traditionally runs budget surpluses ( 5.2% of GDP in 2008 ) , has virtually no public debt , and has over [ORG USD  ] $20 billion in offshore sovereign wealth funds , much of it from record copper revenues . 
One of world , s most open economies , [LOC Chile  ] boasts trade agreements with 58 countries . 
Thanks to strong economic growth and targeted initiatives , poverty has dropped from 40% of the national population in 1990 to 14% in 2006 . 
Nonetheless , the global economic downturn has significantly impacted [LOC Chile  ] , s real economy , with unemployment rising to double digit levels and the economy set to contract by 1% this year . 
[ORG SANTIAGO  ] 00000566 002 OF 003 ------------------------------------------- A Strong and [ORG Dynamic Bilateral Relationship  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Chile  ] have forged a vibrant bilateral partnership over the years , with strong institutions in both countries ensuring continued cooperation from the bottom up as well as from the top down . 
The new [ORG Chile-California Partnership  ] for the 21st Century , launched by President [PER Bachelet  ] and Governor [PER Schwarzenegger  ] in June 2008 , highlights the economic and geographic similarities between [LOC Chile  ] and [LOC California  ] and fosters collaboration in agriculture , energy efficiency , environmental resource management , and education . 
Bilateral military and law enforcement ties are among the very best in the Hemisphere . 
Under the [ORG U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement  ] , annual bilateral trade has nearly tripled in five years to $20 billion , with [LOC Chile  ] our fifth largest trading partner in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
Weak intellectual property protection is among the very few strains in an otherwise thriving trade and investment relationship. --------------------------------------------- ----------- [ORG Clean Energy  ] , Health , and Education -- [ORG Shared Priorities  ] --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC U.S.  ] [LOC Chile  ] cooperation is set to expand into several [ORG Obama Administration  ] priorities -- clean energy , health and education . 
-- [LOC Chile  ] , s renewable energy endowments -- solar , wind , and geothermal -- are among the best in the hemisphere . 
A strong proponent of the Energy and [ORG Climate Partnership  ] for the [ORG Americas  ] initiative , [LOC Chile  ] will sign a Memorandum of Understanding with the [ORG U.S. Department of Energy  ] to strengthen [LOC Chile  ] 's new renewable energy center and help launch solar energy pilot projects in northern [LOC Chile  ] . 
-- Improving health care is a key part of President [PER Bachelet  ] 's legacy . 
She has expanded coverage to those most in need , developing health care facilities in poorer neighborhoods and improving coverage for dozens of the most frequent illnesses . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Chile  ] are now exploring ways to deepen cooperation in providing health care to third countries . 
With infant and maternal mortality rates similar to developed countries , [LOC Chile  ] has focused its assistance in [MISC South American  ] countries to lower the mortality rates where it is highest -- [LOC Bolivia  ] , [LOC Paraguay  ] , and [LOC Ecuador  ] . 
[LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Chilean  ] experts could expand further [LOC Chile  ] 's effective assistance to help reduce infant and maternal mortality rates in [LOC Central America  ] and [LOC Haiti.  ] --President [PER Bachelet  ] has sought with less success to improve [LOC Chile  ] 's public education system . 
However , she has launched important initiatives and worked with us to expand post-graduate studies in the [LOC United States  ] . 
Under the [ORG Equal Opportunities Scholarship Program  ] launched in 2007 , up to 100 talented and less advantaged [MISC Chileans  ] with limited [MISC English  ] are able to study [MISC English  ] and pursue PhD programs at [LOC U.S.  ] universities each year . 
This initiative is funded in part by a $6 billion GOC endowment that helps finance a broader expansion of graduate education , much of it focused on [LOC U.S.  ] universities. ----------------------------------- Possible [PER Bachelet  ] Discussion Topics ----------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) President [PER Bachelet  ] or other members of her delegation may raise the following topics -- that loom large in the [MISC Chilean  ] context -- during her visit with President [PER Obama  ] or other USG officials: --Regional overview . 
[PER Bachelet  ] may wish to present her views on regional trends in the two months following the [LOC Trinidad  ] summit . 
[LOC Chile  ] may offer to weigh in with [LOC Bolivia  ] and [LOC Ecuador  ] to promote more moderate , pro [LOC U.S.  ] policies. --Haiti/Central [LOC America  ] . 
[PER Bachelet  ] may raise the potential for triangular [LOC U.S.  ] [LOC Chile  ] cooperation in heath , law enforcement , and agriculture with other partners in the hemisphere including [LOC Haiti  ] and [ORG Central America.  ] --Global economic recovery . 
[LOC Chile  ] , s strong economic institutions , sound fiscal policies , and intellectual leadership give its voice weight in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
[PER Bachelet  ] [ORG SANTIAGO  ] 00000566 003 OF 003 may wish to provide [LOC Chile  ] 's input on the global economic recovery , and could ask to join the [MISC G-20  ] . 
-- AH1N1 Flu Virus . 
[LOC Chile  ] is the fourth country with the most registered AH1N1 cases , and the flu virus is spreading rapidly in the current wet winter climate . 
[ORG CDC  ] is working closely with its [MISC Chilean  ] counterparts to monitor the outbreak . 
[PER Bachelet  ] may discuss the flu outbreak and seek more anti-viral medicine , [LOC Tamiflu  ] , from the large [LOC U.S.  ] stockpile. --Black Liquor/Intellectual property . 
[LOC Chile  ] is seeking early elimination of a tax credit received by [LOC U.S.  ] paper companies for mixing a pulp by-product with diesel fuel . 
The [MISC Chilean  ] pulp and paper industry has decried the measure as a subsidy that makes their companies uncompetitive . 
We have been working with [LOC Chile  ] , s trade ministry to see if progress on this issue could be combined with advances in fulfilling [LOC Chile  ] , s intellectual property commitments .
