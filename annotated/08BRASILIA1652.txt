( C ) SUMMARY . 
The [MISC Ukrainian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Brasilia  ] is urging the [ORG USG  ] to reconsider its earlier position and now support the [MISC Ukrainian-Brazilian  ] space launch venture that will operate out of [ORG Alcantara  ] , allowing [LOC U.S.  ] satellite firms to benefit from these facilities . 
While the [MISC Ukrainians  ] noted some possible commercial and other benefits to the [LOC United States  ] , they stressed that the principal reason for the [ORG USG  ] to agree to this request is to help keep the [MISC Russians  ] out of the space launch field in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Post would appreciate [LOC Washington  ] 's guidance on how to respond to the [MISC Ukrainians  ] about this request . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [MISC Ukrainian  ] Defense Attache in [LOC Brasilia  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , requested a meeting with [ORG Embassy  ] staff to discuss space cooperation . 
Accordingly , on December 12 Assistant Air Attache [PER Mark Harrington  ] and Science Counselor [PER Richard Driscoll  ] met with [MISC Ukrainian  ] Ambassador [PER Volodymyr Lakomov  ] , [PER Oleksandr Serdyuk  ] , the General Director for [ORG Alcantara Cyclone Space  ] ( a [MISC Ukrainian-Brazilian  ] joint venture ) , and the [PER Rustam Akhunov  ] , First Secretary at the [MISC Ukrainian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] . 
The [MISC Ukrainians  ] want [ORG USG  ] support for the [LOC Alcantara  ] project . 
They noted that when [LOC Ukraine  ] had raised the subject earlier with the [ORG USG  ] that the response had been that we would not support ( though not necessarily oppose it ) . 
Now , [LOC Ukraine  ] would like the [ORG USG  ] to revisit that decision. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Serdyuk  ] outlined three principal reasons why the [ORG USG  ] should be supportive of the Ukraine-Brazil project . 
First , he said that [LOC Ukraine  ] could use its influence with the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congress  ] to obtain approval for the long-stalled [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] space cooperation agreement regarding [LOC Alcantara  ] . 
When asked to elaborate , he said there are many in the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Congress  ] who are friendly towards [LOC Ukraine  ] and he could win them over to support ratification of the agreement with the [LOC United States  ] . 
Second , he noted that [LOC Ukraine  ] was working with a [LOC U.S.  ] firm , [ORG Orbital Science  ] , hinting that if this project ever got off the ground that the [LOC U.S.  ] firm [ORG Orbital Science  ] could benefit commercially . 
Also , he said [LOC U.S.  ] satellite firms may find it much less expensive to use the [LOC Alcantara  ] facility than other options . 
He estimated a cost savings of up to 30 percent . 
Third , the [MISC Ukrainians  ] repeatedly emphasized that if this space cooperation activity with [LOC Brazil  ] did not start making some headway that the [MISC Brazilians  ] would turn to the [MISC Russians  ] waiting in the wings .

) [ORG ALCANTARA  ] UPDATE <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [MISC Ukrainians  ] briefed [ORG Embassy  ] officers on developments at [LOC Alcantara  ] . 
[PER Serdyuk  ] highlighted the ideal location of this launch facility , which was at 2.3 degrees [LOC South  ] and so , less expensive for launching satellites into geostationary orbits . 
The [MISC Ukrainians  ] have a launcher , the [ORG Cyclone  ] 2 , which can carry a payload of up to 1,600 kilograms or 5.3 tons into orbit . 
[LOC Ukraine  ] will provide the launch vehicles in this joint venture ; [LOC Brazil  ] will provide basic infrastructure , such as seaport , airport , and roads . 
They both would work on construction of the launch site . 
Following a serious accident at the [LOC Alcantara  ] site on August 22 , 2003 , which put the joint venture on hold for years , both sides are now trying to move forward . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has been grappling with a land title problem because a local community descended from runaway slaves ( called a quilombo ) has claimed the original site . 
[PER Serdyuk  ] reported that the [MISC Brazilian  ] government has decided to construct a new launch site in a nearby locale , abandoning the initial site . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] side of activities at [LOC Alcantara  ] is handled by [ORG CTA  ] , which is an entity of the [MISC Brazilian  ] Air [MISC Force.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [MISC Ukrainians  ] are aiming to launch their first commercial payload from the new [MISC Brazilian  ] site in 2011 , which would be an [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001652 002 OF 002 [MISC Argentine  ] satellite , and expect another [MISC Argentine  ] satellite in 2012 , as well as some demand from [LOC Brazil  ] Telecom . 
COMMENT <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [MISC Ukrainians  ] want to know if the [ORG USG  ] will reconsider its earlier decision and agree to support the Ukraine-Brazil joint venture by allowing them to launch [LOC U.S.  ] satellites . 
While the [MISC Ukrainians  ] highlighted the benefits to the [LOC United States  ] , their principle argument was that if the [ORG USG  ] doesn't take this step , then the [MISC Russians  ] will fill the void and become the chief partner for [LOC Brazil  ] on space cooperation . 
As noted in REFTEL , [LOC Brazil-Russia  ] space launch cooperation has high level political support . 
[MISC Ukrainian  ] protestations notwithstanding , it is unlikely that [LOC Brazil  ] sees cooperation with [LOC Ukraine  ] and [LOC Russia  ] as an either/or proposition. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) Post would appreciate [LOC Washington  ] 's guidance on how to respond to the [MISC Ukrainian  ] request for [ORG USG  ] support or involvement in the [MISC Ukrainian-Brazilian  ] space launch joint venture .
