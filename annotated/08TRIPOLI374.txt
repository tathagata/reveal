REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) , ( e ) 1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Summary:  ] A senior [ORG National Security Council  ] official asked what the [ORG USG  ] 's views were on the possibility of [LOC U.S.-Libya  ] civilian nuclear cooperation and on sales of lethal military equipment to [LOC Libya  ] . 
Building a nuclear reactor for peaceful uses , principally power generation and water desalination , is a key [ORG GOL  ] priority and [LOC Libya  ] would prefer that a [LOC U.S.  ] company and/or the [ORG USG  ] provide technical guidance and/or undertake construction efforts . 
The official stressed that the [ORG GOL  ] is anxious to resolve outstanding bilateral political irritants ( terrorism-related claims in [LOC U.S.  ] courts , the [MISC Lautenberg Amendment  ] ) before the current [LOC U.S.  ] administration 's term expires to ensure greater bilateral cooperation and [LOC U.S.  ] commercial activity in [LOC Libya  ] . 
It was not clear that the requests for the [ORG USG  ] 's views on civilian nuclear cooperation and lethal military equipment sales had been fully coordinated with other elements of the [ORG GOL  ] . 
Please see guidance request at para 8 . 
End summary . 
[ORG GOL  ] WANTS NUCLEAR REACTOR PLANT FOR CIVILIAN PURPOSES 2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In a meeting with the [ORG CDA  ] on May 7 , Dr. [PER Hind Siala  ] , Director of Foreign Liaison and [ORG International Cooperation  ] at [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Security Council  ] ( [ORG NSC  ] ) , asked what the [ORG USG  ] 's views were on the possibility of [LOC U.S.-Libya  ] civilian nuclear cooperation . 
[PER Siala  ] said building a nuclear reactor for peaceful uses , to include power generation and water desalination , is a [ORG GOL  ] priority . 
According to [PER Siala  ] , the [ORG GOL  ] would strongly prefer that [LOC U.S.  ] companies , in concert with the [ORG USG  ] , provide technical guidance and/or undertake construction . 
If [LOC U.S.  ] companies and/or the [ORG USG  ] are not interested in participating in such a project directly , the [ORG GOL  ] wants assurances that the [ORG USG  ] would approve [LOC Libya  ] offering an international tender for construction of a civilian reactor by third-country parties . 
CLAIMS [LOC U.S.  ] NUCLEAR COOPERATION WOULD NOT CONTRADICT PARALLEL EFFORTS WITH [LOC FRANCE  ] & [LOC RUSSIA  ] 3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [ORG CDA  ] noted media reports claiming the [ORG GOL  ] had signed civilian nuclear cooperation agreements with [LOC France  ] during President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's visit to [LOC Tripoli  ] in July 2007 , and with [LOC Russia  ] during President [PER Putin  ] 's visit in April . 
( Note: As reported ref A , at the [ORG GOL  ] 's insistence , [LOC Libya  ] and [LOC Russia  ] signed a memorandum of understanding committing them to finalization of a formal cooperation agreement on civilian uses of nuclear energy by the end of 2008 . 
The [ORG GOL  ] hoped to sign the formal agreement during [PER Putin  ] 's visit ; however , no language was agreed to before the visit and [LOC Russia  ] refused to sign without further consultations . 
[MISC Russian  ] contacts here claimed the formal agreement - if signed - would only establish a general framework for future cooperation and would not/not be keyed to any specific projects . 
End note . 
) [PER Siala  ] averred that [LOC U.S.-Libya  ] civilian nuclear cooperation would complement , not contradict , parallel efforts with [LOC France  ] and [LOC Libya  ] . 
Conceding she is not fully briefed on [LOC Libya  ] 's nuclear aspirations , she did not know how many reactor plants the [ORG GOL  ] envisages building ; however , she reiterated that desalination was a primary goal . 
USG'S POSITION ON POSSIBILITY OF LETHAL MILITARY EQUIPMENT SALES SOUGHT 4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Siala  ] next raised the possibility of [LOC U.S.  ] sales of lethal military equipment . 
Noting that the issue had been raised during [ORG NEA  ] Assistant Secretary [PER David Welch  ] 's visit in August 2007 , she stressed that " time is pressing " from the [ORG GOL  ] 's perspective . 
[LOC Libya  ] understood that difficult bilateral issues such as outstanding terrorism-related claims in [LOC U.S.  ] courts remained and that building trust took time ; however , if there were " other political issues " that would prevent the [LOC U.S.  ] from selling [LOC Libya  ] lethal military equipment in the future , the [ORG GOL  ] would prefer to know now so that it can pursue other options . 
[ORG GOL  ] ANXIOUS TO RESOLVE OUTSTANDING POLITICAL ISSUES BEFORE YEAR'S END 5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Drawing a line between concerns about potential nuclear and military cooperation and efforts to find a comprehensive settlement of terrorism-related claims in [LOC U.S.  ] courts , [PER Siala  ] stressed the importance of resolving political issues before the current [LOC U.S.  ] administration 's term expires to [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000374 002 OF 002 facilitate greater bilateral cooperation . 
Reiterating points we 've heard before , she noted that [MISC European  ] and other companies are heavily involved in [LOC Libya  ] ; the [ORG GOL  ] would like to see more [LOC U.S.  ] companies active here . 
Section 1083 of the 2008 [ORG National Defense Authorization Act  ] ( the so-called " [MISC Lautenberg Amendment  ] " ) greatly complicated the business environment in [LOC Libya  ] for [LOC U.S.  ] companies , whose assets were potentially at risk of attachment . 
Expressing concern that a new [LOC U.S.  ] administration might have different views about reengagement with [LOC Libya  ] , she underscored the need to push ahead quickly with efforts to resolve claims cases and exempt [LOC Libya  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] companies from application of the [MISC Lautenberg Amendment  ] . 
[PER Siala  ] solicited the [ORG CDA  ] 's views on the effectiveness of the [ORG Livingston Group  ] , a lobbying organization hired to help burnish [LOC Libya  ] 's reputation in [LOC Washington  ] , and asked about the status of proposed negotiations on outstanding claims . 
6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) On cooperation , [PER Siala  ] proposed the further and expanded exchange of senior visitors , even as efforts to resolve the claims and [MISC Lautenberg  ] issues continue . 
Emphasizing our agreement with that approach , the [ORG CDA  ] noted difficulties post had encountered in trying to bring in [LOC U.S.  ] visitors for educational and cultural programs , referencing comments by [ORG MFA  ] officials to the effect that such visits were inappropriate since [LOC U.S.-Libya  ] relations were not " fully normalized " ( ref B ) . 
Expressing surprise , [PER Siala  ] agreed to inform [ORG National Security Adviser  ] [PER Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi to see if the [ORG NSC  ] could help alleviate those problems . 
7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Comment: Although  ] she was clearly conveying points at the behest of her boss , [PER NSA Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi , it struck us that the requests for the [ORG USG  ] 's views on civilian nuclear cooperation and lethal military equipment sales had not been fully coordinated with other elements of the [ORG GOL  ] ( the [ORG MOD  ] and [ORG MFA  ] equivalents , for example ) that usually have a voice on those issues . 
We suspect that [PER Muatassim  ] may be seeking to explore the parameters of areas in which he can push for expanded bilateral cooperation . 
The questions nonetheless underscore the expectation in certain quarters of the [ORG GOL  ] that bilateral cooperation will expand very rapidly - including in sensitive issue areas - if a comprehensive settlement of outstanding terrorism-related legal claims and the [MISC Lautenberg Amendment  ] issue can be achieved . 
Bearing in mind the [ORG GOL  ] 's disappointment that assumptions about the depth of engagement immediately after its decision in December 2003 to abandon WMD aspirations and renounce terrorism were not met , we will need to temper its current expectations and carefully coordinate our response to requests for expansion of cooperation into sensitive areas . 
End comment .

( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Guidance request: [ORG Request Department  ] guidance on whether and how Post should further respond to the request for the [ORG USG  ] 's views on possible civilian nuclear cooperation and lethal military equipment sales .
