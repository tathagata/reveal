( [ORG U  ] ) Summary: In a move apparently designed to resuscitate his party 's hopes of surviving 2007 parliamentary elections , Halldor [PER Asgrimsson  ] announced 6/5 that he would resign both as [MISC Icelandic  ] Prime Minister and as [ORG Progressive Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) Chairman . 
The dates for his departure remain unclear while the governing [ORG PP-Independence Party  ] ( [ORG IP  ] ) coalition ponders options for shuffling the cabinet and while [ORG PP  ] stalwarts duke it out for leadership of a party in crisis . 
One thing is sure: FM [ORG Geir Haarde  ] will be [LOC Iceland  ] 's next PM . 
[LOC Iceland  ] 's foreign policy will likely continue on its current liberal internationalist course , but a new Foreign Minister - as yet unnamed - could potentially appoint a new defense negotiator to replace [PER Albert Jonsson  ] . 
End summary. ----------------------------- Problems for the [MISC Progressives  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Following a mysterious press leak and several days of feverish speculation , Prime Minister [PER Halldor Asgrimsson  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) told a press conference June 5 that he would resign his government post in the coming days and his party chairmanship at the next [ORG Progressive Party  ] conference . 
He announced that the [ORG PP Vice Chair  ] , Minister of Agriculture [PER Gudni Agustsson  ] , would also give up his party post ; and touted [PER Finnur Ingolfsson  ] , a former [ORG PP  ] minister of industry who now runs an insurance company , as his ( [PER Asgrimsson  ] 's ) preferred party successor as well as a potential Minister of [LOC Finance.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While [PER Asgrimsson  ] , PM since September 2004 , thus symbolically accepted responsibility for his party 's poor performance in May 27 municipal elections ( reftel ) , his noble gesture backfired in some quarters , as: -- [PER Agustsson  ] , who remains popular especially with the farmers who make up the [ORG PP  ] 's base , had second thoughts about stepping down , indicating he instead might prefer to succeed [PER Asgrimsson  ] as leader ; -- [PER Ingolfsson  ] came under intense criticism from opposition politicians and media who recalled his reputation for cronyism and corruption while in public office in the 1990s ; and -- [ORG PP  ] rank-and-file objected to [PER Asgrimsson  ] 's attempt effectively to choose his successor personally rather than permit selection by the membership at large. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Ingolfsson  ] evidently read the tea leaves and , within days , announced he would not seek leadership in the [ORG PP  ] . 
Intense speculation continues in [LOC Reykjavik  ] as to whether [PER Agustsson  ] is rightly [PER Asgrimsson  ] 's heir . 
Minister of Industry and [LOC Commerce  ] [PER Valgerdur Sverrisdottir  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) said publicly that she thought not , thus incurring the wrath of self-appointed party unifiers but articulating the worries of the many who view [PER Agustsson  ] , with his archaic [MISC Icelandic  ] and equine policy focus , as not up to the job . 
Other contenders for the chairmanship include Minister of Health [PER Siv Fridleifsdottir  ] , who is also a former Environment Minister and known to be fiercely ambitious ; and [ORG MP Jonina Bjartmarz  ] , an experienced lawyer repeatedly passed over by [PER Asgrimsson  ] for ministerial slots - a history that led to a [ORG PP  ] gender gap . 
[PER Bjorn Ingi Hrafnsson  ] , [PER Asgrimsson  ] 's protege and new [ORG Reykjavik City Council  ] Chairman , is considered not yet ripe for the party chairman 's job. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) A decision on [PER Asgrimsson  ] 's [ORG PP  ] successor will go to a party conference originally scheduled for spring 2007 , moved to fall 2006 as the party contemplated last month 's disappointing results , and now tentatively scheduled for this summer as the party scrambles to restore order to its feuding ranks. ------------------------------ Opportunities for [LOC Independence  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In accord with the IP-PP 2003 coalition agreement , [PER Asgrimsson  ] 's resignation puts the [ORG IP  ] Chairman , now FM [ORG Geir Haarde  ] , in the PM 's chair . 
As ministers have been tied up the week of June 5 hosting a [ORG Council of Baltic Sea States  ] summit , the Government announced that the consequent cabinet reshuffle would not take place until the week of June 12 . 
[ORG Reykjavik  ] 's rumor mill has meanwhile gone to work speculating on the likely replacement for [ORG Haarde  ] at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) FM possibilities include: -- Minister of [ORG Justice  ] and Ecclesiastical Affairs [PER Bjorn Bjarnason  ] , a former Minister of Education and son of a previous Foreign and Prime Minister ( [PER Bjarni Benediktsson  ] , who negotiated the bilateral 1951 [ORG Defense Agreement  ] on behalf of [LOC Iceland  ] ) . 
[PER Bjarnason  ] is a committed Atlanticist and acknowledged security expert but has been among the angriest members of the [ORG GOI  ] about what he perceives as [LOC U.S  ] . 
" unilateralism " in announcing the closure of [ORG Naval Air Station Keflavik  ] . 
-- Minister of Education [PER Thorgerdur Katrin Gunnarsdottir  ] , who is vice chair of the [ORG Independence Party  ] . 
[PER Gunnarsdottir  ] has limited foreign affairs experience but is said to get along a lot better personally with [ORG Haarde  ] than does [PER Bjarnason  ] . 
-- Minister of Finance [PER Arni Mathiesen  ] , a former Minister of [ORG Fisheries  ] and another son of a cabinet minister . 
Though respected for his brains and seriousness , [PER Mathiesen  ] is actually a veterinarian by profession . 
-- Minister of [ORG Fisheries Einar K. Gudfinnsson  ] , known for his strong support of commercial whaling . 
Presumably none of these would owe the same debt of gratitude as [ORG Haarde  ] did to former [ORG IP  ] Chairman ( and Prime Minister and Foreign Minister ) [PER David Oddsson  ] . 
Thus liberated , the new FM might feel free to replace [PER Oddsson  ] 's close friend [PER Albert Jonsson  ] as defense negotiator . 
[PER Jonsson  ] told the Embassy June 7 that he expects to stay on as [LOC Iceland  ] 's chief defense negotiator until he replaces [PER Helgi Agustsson  ] as [LOC Iceland  ] 's Ambassador to the [LOC United States  ] in November 2006. van Voorst</pre></code>
