End Summary . 
[ORG ASEAN  ] 's Problematic Newer Members --------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Regional stability will be enhanced the more [MISC ASEAN  ] is able to " get its act together , " Minister [PER Mentor Lee Kuan Yew  ] told visiting [ORG EAP  ] DAS [PER Christensen  ] and the Ambassador during an October 16 meeting . 
However , [MISC ASEAN  ] should not have admitted [LOC Burma  ] , [LOC Cambodia  ] , [LOC Laos  ] and [LOC Vietnam  ] as members in the 1990 's , [PER Lee  ] argued . 
The older members of [MISC ASEAN  ] shared common values and an antipathy to Communism . 
Those values had been " muddied " by the new members , and their economic and social problems made it doubtful they would ever behave like the older [MISC ASEAN  ] members. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER MM Lee  ] was most optimistic about [LOC Vietnam  ] . 
He characterized the [MISC Vietnamese  ] as " bright , fast learners " who will contribute to [MISC ASEAN  ] 's development . 
[LOC Vietnam  ] also does not want to see [LOC China  ] 's influence in [LOC Southeast Asia  ] become too great . 
[LOC Cambodia  ] has not recovered yet from its difficult history and the political system is too personalized around Prime Minister Hun Sen. [PER MM Lee  ] dismissed [LOC Laos  ] as an outpost for [LOC China  ] , saying [LOC Laos  ] reports back to [LOC China  ] on theQproceedings from all [MISC ASEAN  ] meetings . 
[LOC Burma  ] 's [MISC Generals:  ] " Dense " and " Stupid " -------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Turning to [LOC Burma  ] , [PER MM Lee  ] expressed his scorn for the regime 's leadership . 
He said he had given up on them a decade ago , called them " dense " and " stupid " and said they had " mismanaged " the country 's great natural resources . 
He asserted that [LOC China  ] had the greatest influence over the regime and had heavily penetrated the [MISC Burmese  ] economy . 
[LOC China  ] was worried that the country could " blow up " which would endanger its significant investments , pipelines , and the approximately two million [MISC Chinese  ] estimated to be working in the country . 
[LOC India  ] was worried about [LOC China  ] 's influence in [LOC Burma  ] and was engaged with the regime in an attempt to minimize [LOC China  ] 's influence . 
[LOC India  ] lacked [LOC China  ] 's finer grasp of how [LOC Burma  ] worked , however . 
Resolving the Crisis in [LOC Burma  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER MM Lee  ] thought one possible solution to the crisis in [LOC Burma  ] would be for a group of younger military officers who were less " obtuse " to step forward and recognize that the current situation was untenable . 
They could share power with the democracy activists , although probably not with [PER Aung San Suu Kyi  ] , who was anathema to the military . 
It would be a long process . 
He said that [LOC Burma  ] 's ambassador in [LOC Singapore  ] had told [ORG MFA  ] that [LOC Burma  ] could " survive any sanctions " due to its natural resources . 
[PER Lee  ] said dealing with the regime was like " talking to dead people . 
" SBY as Envoy ? ------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Asked about the possibility of [ORG ASEAN  ] naming a [LOC Burma  ] envoy , [PER MM Lee  ] said an envoy could not be from [LOC Singapore  ] , because [LOC Singapore  ] is seen as too close to the [LOC United States  ] . 
He suggested that [MISC Indonesian  ] President [PER Yudhoyono  ] could potentially be an interlocutor . 
As a former general , SBY [LOC SINGAPORE  ] 00001932 002 OF 003 might be able to meet with Senior General [PER Than Shwe  ] and get him to listen . 
Furthermore , SBY is " keen to play the role of peacemaker , " but the challenge would be getting someone who is not too close to the [LOC United States  ] to ask him to do it . 
[PER MM Lee  ] said that [LOC Vietnam  ] was a possibility . 
[PER Chen Shui-bian:  ] The Gambler --------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER MM Lee  ] told DAS [PER Christensen  ] his September 11 speech to the [ORG U.S.-Taiwan Business Council  ] set the right " balance " and made it clear to both sides where the [LOC United States  ] stands . 
He criticized President [PER Chen Shui-bian  ] for being a " gambler . 
" [PER Chen  ] had discredited himself with his corruption scandals and the only card he had left was promoting [LOC Taiwan  ] independence ; with nothing left to lose , [PER Chen  ] was ready to " go for broke . 
" [PER MM Lee  ] asserted that [PER Chen  ] feared a post-election criminal investigation regardless of whether the [ORG KMT  ] or [ORG DPP  ] won and had to " consolidate his position . 
" [PER Chen  ] wanted to secure his legacy and avoid becoming a mere " footnote " in [LOC Taiwan  ] history. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Lee  ] said he had told [PER Frank Hsieh  ] and [PER Su Tseng-chang  ] in separate meetings earlier this year that [LOC Taiwan  ] would gain nothing from pursuing independence and would pay a great cost if it did . 
They responded that if [LOC Taiwan  ] did nothing , it would be reunified with the mainland ; they did not want to be a part of the [LOC PRC  ] under any circumstances . 
[PER Lee  ] said he understood their negative history with the [ORG KMT  ] but found their " antipathy , hatred , and revulsion " toward [LOC China  ] to be " unbelievable . 
" A Role for [LOC Japan  ] ---------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [LOC Japan  ] should speak out to restrain [LOC Taiwan  ] from making provocative moves towards independence , [PER MM Lee  ] said . 
He asked what [LOC Japan  ] had agreed to do in response to the proposed referendum on joining the [ORG UN  ] under the name [LOC Taiwan  ] . 
DAS [PER Christensen  ] noted that [LOC Japan  ] has expressed its opposition privately with President [PER Chen  ] , but did not agree to make any public statements opposing the referendum . 
[PER MM Lee  ] suggested that [LOC Japan  ] might be willing to make a public statement now with [PER Yasuo Fukuda  ] serving as prime minister . 
[PER Fukuda  ] has close ties to the [ORG KMT  ] and his father even risked [LOC China  ] 's ire to attend former President [PER Chiang Ching-kuo  ] 's funeral in 1988 , according to [PER Lee  ] . 
Dealing with a Rising [LOC China  ] --------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The more fundamental issue was how to deal with a rising [LOC China  ] , [PER MM Lee  ] observed . 
The intellectual resources of the [LOC United States  ] were being " sucked away " by the problems in the [LOC Middle East  ] , making it difficult for the [LOC United States  ] to focus on [LOC China  ] . 
Over the next several decades , [LOC China  ] wants to concentrate on its internal economic development and to avoid a conflict over [LOC Taiwan  ] , [PER Lee  ] averred . 
However , if [LOC Taiwan  ] declared independence , [LOC China  ] would have no choice but to respond with force because its leaders have left themselves no " loopholes . 
" [LOC China  ] hopes that the [LOC Taiwan  ] issue will be resolved on its own over the next fifty years when [LOC Taiwan  ] 's economy becomes " totally embedded " into [LOC China  ] . 
He pointed to the case of [LOC Hong Kong  ] , where the economy has been booming in recent years due to its greater access to [LOC China  ] 's market and the influx of tourists from the [LOC PRC  ] . 
[ORG ASEAN  ] and [LOC China  ] --------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [LOC China  ] 's strategy for [LOC Southeast Asia  ] was fairly simple , [PER MM Lee  ] claimed . 
[LOC China  ] tells the region , " come grow with me . 
" At the same time , [LOC China  ] 's leaders want to convey the impression that [LOC China  ] 's rise is inevitable and that countries will need to decide if they want to be [LOC China  ] 's friend or foe when it " arrives . 
" [LOC China  ] is also willing to calibrate its engagement to get what it wants or express its displeasure . 
In the case of [LOC Singapore  ] , [LOC China  ] took " great umbrage " over then-Deputy Prime Minister [PER Lee Hsien Loong  ] 's July 2004 visit to [LOC Taiwan  ] . 
[LOC China  ] froze bilateral talks , and the proposed bilateral [MISC Free Trade Agreement  ] ( [ORG FTA  ] ) has not progressed . 
However , [LOC China  ] did not " squeeze " any of [LOC Singapore  ] 's investors and [LOC China  ] remains the largest [LOC SINGAPORE  ] 00001932 003 OF 003 destination for [LOC Singapore  ] 's FDI . 
[PER MM Lee  ] urged the [LOC United States  ] to pursue more FTAs with [ORG ASEAN  ] , or at least key members of [ORG ASEAN  ] , which would give the region more options . 
He said [LOC Malaysia  ] 's unwillingness to bend on its " bumiputera " policy had been an impediment to a [MISC U.S.-Malaysia FTA.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) DAS [PER Christensen  ] has cleared this message .
