He warned that [ORG Al Qaeda  ] would put up a fight in [LOC Mosul  ] and the [MISC Iranians  ] were “not going to go quietly into the night.” [PER Maliki  ] , [PER McCain  ] told the group , was weak but getting better . 
In [LOC Anbar  ] province , he added , there was a demand for elections .

[PER McCain  ] said he was very worried . 
He said it was like “Chicago in the 20’s” and “could go at any time.” The [MISC Iranians  ] were there and the [MISC Iraqis  ] were likely to find “the going to be extremely difficult.” “Just because its quiet , ” said [PER McCain  ] , “doesn’t mean it’s good . 
It is quiet for all the wrong reasons.” Pledge on Troops ---------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER Cameron  ] and [PER Hague  ] told the [MISC Senators  ] that the [MISC Conservatives  ] would never take a policy position that would undermine [MISC British  ] policies where troops are involved . 
[PER Hague  ] noted the [MISC Conservatives  ] largely share the [ORG Labour  ] foreign policy agenda . 
[PER Cameron  ] said Prime Minister [PER Brown  ] did not have the political support to increase the [MISC British  ] troop presence in [LOC Iraq  ] , saying “that moment has passed.” [PER Hague  ] seconded Cameron’s assessment . 
[PER Cameron  ] asked [PER McCain  ] whether the [MISC British  ] plans for a further draw-down should not go forward , given that HMG could not both maintain a presence in [LOC Iraq  ] and build up its role in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
In response , [PER McCain  ] thanked [PER Cameron  ] and for [MISC Britain’s  ] contribution in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER McCain  ] said he understood the Prime Minister intended to withdraw [MISC British  ] troops prior to the next election . 
[PER Hague  ] confirmed [PER Brown  ] politically could not do otherwise. “I understand that , ” said [PER McCain  ] , “the [MISC British  ] people have my gratitude for all that you have done.” [LOC Israel  ] ------ [LOC LONDON  ] 00000929 002 OF 002 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER McCain  ] told [PER Cameron  ] that Israel’s Prime Minster [PER Ehud Omert  ] was “still paying the price for [PER Lebanon.” Cameron  ] asked whether Quartet Leader [PER Tony Blair  ] was optimistic . 
[PER McCain  ] said he admired [PER Blair  ] for his steadfastness , but what [PER McCain  ] had noticed in international relations was the tendency of statesmen to be optimistic once they become negotiators . 
[LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER McCain  ] told [PER Cameron  ] he saw an increasing , and increasingly damaging role , for [LOC Iran  ] in regional affairs . 
This included an increase in activity in [LOC Iraq  ] and in arming [ORG Hezbollah  ] . 
[PER McCain  ] said he advocated gathering [LOC Europe  ] to “cut off all credit” to [LOC Iran  ] . 
Not just [LOC Europe  ] , but other like-minded nations such as [LOC Japan  ] , should be encouraged to take collective action on such matters , he said . 
[PER Hague  ] responded that he and the [MISC Conservatives  ] had been pushing for this for the last two years . 
[PER Hague  ] and [PER Cameron  ] alleged that the release of the [ORG National Intelligence Assessment  ] had set back this effort . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] ------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER Cameron  ] told [PER McCain  ] that he and his party focused on [LOC Afghanistan  ] as the key foreign police issue . 
This was due , not least , to the timeline for when the [MISC Conservatives  ] might come into office ( 2010 or 2009 at the earliest ) and the fact that [MISC British  ] troops were meant to be out of [LOC Iraq  ] by then . 
[PER Cameron  ] also raised [LOC Pakistan  ] , noting that 60,000 individuals travel to [LOC Pakistan  ] from the [LOC UK  ] each year and that this has implications for the UK’s own significant domestic “terror threat.” [PER Cameron  ] said he was interested in exploring the idea of whether [ORG ISAF  ] and Enduring Freedom operations could be combined , as well as whether an increase in military presence was required or an enhanced civilian presence was more important . 
[PER McCain  ] replied that [LOC Afghanistan  ] is complicated by the uncertainty in [LOC Pakistan.  ] “We all like [PER Karzai  ] , ” he said , “but his is a very weak government.” [PER Cameron  ] said [ORG NATO  ] troop capacity was “patchy” and there appeared to be perpetual problems with shortages of air transport support . 
[PER McCain  ] said he was worried about [LOC Pakistan.  ] “If they don’t cooperate and help us , I don’t know what we are going to do , ” he said . 
He added , “Waziristan hasn’t been ruled for 2,000 years.” On a positive note , [PER McCain  ] praised the fighting capacity of [MISC Afghans  ] , whom he called “great fighters.” [PER Cameron  ] said each year he met with [PER Karzai  ] , and each year he had the sense [MISC Karzai’s  ] sphere of influence was shrinking. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 .
