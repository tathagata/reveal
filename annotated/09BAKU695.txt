[MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX Focus  ] on [PER Mesbah-Yazdi  ] --------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , said that for several years he has been researching the life , ideology , and political activities of [PER Ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi  ] , on whom he now considers himself an expert.XXXXXXXXXXXX . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) XXXXXXXXXXXXsaid that [PER Mesbah-Yazdi  ] likes to work behind the scenes , and as a result his significance in current [MISC Iranian  ] politics ( [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ) is widely underestimated . 
Kaymars said that , like [PER Khomeini  ] , [PER Mesbah-Yazdi  ] sometimes cites [PER Plato  ] , and notably The [MISC Republic  ] ( as interpreted by him ) as a " philosophical " guide . 
According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER Mesbah-Yazdi  ] is deeply " anti-liberal democratic , " regarding liberal democracy and its trappings as a charade leading to a wrongly-guided state based on selfishness , immorality , and diversion from morally and politically " right " paths.XXXXXXXXXXXX asserted that [PER Mesbah-Yazdi  ] has been quietly expanding his influence with [ORG Revolutionary Guard  ] and [ORG Basij  ] figures for years , and was the single most important player in the election fraud , and also played a key role in many other regime pre- and post- election actions . 
" You can't understand what 's been going on in [LOC Iran  ] without understanding ( the beliefs and activities of ) [PER Mesbah-Yazdi  ] , " he claimed . 
" [LOC Iran  ] is Being Transformed " -------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] contended that an historic transformation is currently going on in [LOC Iran  ] , unifying wide ranges of classes and ages . 
He described the transformation as a process with three " critical phases . 
" Phase One , immediately after the election , was characterized by shock , anger , and " people [ORG BAKU  ] 00000695 002 OF 003 sobbing in the streets . 
" He explained that before the election , many [MISC Iranians  ] had argued that there was at least some democracy in the system , and that if left alone the regime would by itself evolve into a more democratic and liberal state . 
Even system opponents and self-declared skeptics felt that evolutionary change within the system was possible . 
According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the blatantly stolen election and the cynical , repressive aftermath were " blows to the face " that largely demolished this view. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Kaymars called [PER Ayatollah Khameini  ] 's June 19 sermon " the second transformational point . 
" He asserted that after [PER Khameini  ] 's public anointment of [MISC Ahmedinejad  ] , and references to his " divinely inspired " election victory , " [LOC Tehran  ] exploded . 
" He compared public reaction in the days after the election to the 1999 [LOC Tehran  ] student demonstrations ( in which he also participated ) . 
He explained that in 1999 , " we hoped ( in vain ) for [MISC South Tehranis  ] to join us , " but in June and July 2009 " [MISC South Tehranis  ] were everywhere . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In contrast to 1999 , he continued , for many days " everybody " protested and/or shouted slogans from the rooftops: &North [PER Tehranis  ] , [MISC South Tehranis  ] , students , bazaaris , were chanting death to [PER Khameini  ] , death to the dictator , we are unified , 8 and other protest slogans . 
" A lot of people were in the streets ( in the days after the sermon ) , and a lot of shooting occurred , " he said . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] " <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , " Phase Three " began with [PER Rafsanjani  ] 's re-galvanizing sermon on July 17 , and is currently ongoing . 
" Don't be misled by the current calm surface , " he warned , " a lot of political activity is happening . 
" [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
He nonetheless acknowledged [PER Rafsanjani  ] 's " cleverness " and strength of personality , and said he remains important in the near term for intra-regime political maneuvering , and for " funneling money " to support the opposition . 
[PER Khameini  ] " Not Close to [PER Ahmadinejad  ] " ----------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] observed that Supreme Leader [PER Khameini  ] is not personally close to [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , or even strongly in favor of him , but is caught between the " rock " of [LOC Rafsanjani/Moussavi  ] and the " hard place " of [PER Mesbah-Yazdi  ] , [PER Ahmadinejad  ] , and their [ORG Revolutionary Guard  ] allies . 
He claimed that [PER Khameini  ] has limited political maneuverability , and is primarily focused on protecting his and his son [PER Mojtaba  ] 's future . 
He asserted that opposition efforts are underway to split [PER Khameini  ] from the [MISC Mebah-Yazdi  ] group , and scapegoat the latter for legal and human rights abuses . 
Opposition Use of Foreign Media and the [MISC Internet  ] --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] asserted that most [MISC Iranians  ] are repulsed and embarrassed by the show trials , and despite nagging historical " default " suspicion of [LOC Britain  ] , " no one believes that foreign countries were behind the protests . 
" He said that [MISC Iranians  ] have no confidence in domestic media , and claimed that [PER Mousavi  ] and his allies are effectively using foreign media and the internet to propagandize and get their word out . 
He said that , " even in villages , at least one person in every family is internet-literate , " and claimed that [MISC Iranians  ] have become adept at successfully playing " hide and seek " with the authorities , " and are becoming more so . 
" He added that [ORG BBC  ] and [ORG VOA  ] are widely watched , and are also playing " a very important role " in delivering and spreading opposition-based and other information . 
[ORG BAKU  ] 00000695 003 OF 003 Narcotics and [ORG Drug Addiction  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 .

In addition to the widespread availability of cheap opiate derivatives , he noted that the addictive , &high8 producing pain-killer Tramadol ( [ORG AKA  ] &Zydol8 ) is very popular and can be purchased without a prescription at any pharmacy , at the price of ten pills for 50 cents .
