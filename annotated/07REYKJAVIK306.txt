( [ORG SBU  ] ) Pol Chief passed reftel points as well as President [PER Bush  ] 's Oct. 24 remarks and the [LOC White House  ] fact sheet on [LOC Cuba  ] policy to the [ORG Icelandic Ministry for Foreign Affairs  ] on 25 October . 
MFA Minister-Counsellor for [ORG International Organization Affairs  ] [PER Nikulas Hannigan  ] was appreciative of the additional information regarding new USG initiatives to support democracy activists in [LOC Cuba.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) With regard to the [MISC Cuban-sponsored  ] [ORG UN General Assembly  ] resolution against the [LOC U.S.  ] embargo , [PER Hannigan  ] noted that this is one area in which the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Iceland  ] have traditionally disagreed . 
While the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] shares [LOC U.S.  ] concern for the human rights situation in [LOC Cuba  ] -- and will strongly consider submitting an explanation of vote expressing same -- it disagrees with the embargo as a good tactic for achieving progress in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
As a result , the MFA sees little reason to alter its historical pattern of voting for the resolution .
