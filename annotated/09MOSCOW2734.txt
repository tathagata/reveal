Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) During Foreign Secretary [PER Miliband’s  ] November 1-2 visit , he put an end to the “period of standoff , ” but had little concrete to show for his visit . 
In pushing a new framework for cooperation , he set aside the most contentious issues and focused primarily on the international agenda during his meetings with [MISC Russian  ] FM [PER Lavrov  ] -- START Follow-on , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Middle East  ] peace , and non-proliferation -- resulting in three joint statements . 
[PER Miliband  ] also met with [PER Gorbachev  ] and [MISC Russian  ] business leaders and political notables . 
[LOC Moscow  ] had some lingering hesitancy , with [PER Medvedev  ] and [PER Putin  ] declining meetings , due in part to concerns based on previous interaction between [PER Lavrov  ] and [PER Miliband  ] , and a desire to avoid giving [PER Miliband  ] a success that he could use in a potential run to head [ORG EU  ] foreign policy . 
End Summary . 
Ending the “Period of [LOC Standoff”  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On November 1-2 , [MISC British  ] Foreign Secretary [PER David Miliband  ] ended the five-year hiatus in bilateral visits . 
In his discussions with [MISC Russian  ] FM [PER Sergey Lavrov  ] , [PER Miliband  ] was able to set a new pattern for addressing contentious bilateral issues in the future , while forging ahead on the international agenda . 
While the [MISC Russian  ] press has hailed this as a “reset , ” it comes after the slow build up of bilateral contacts at all levels , and is therefore less of a breakthrough than a symbolic final hurdle. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) While the visit succeeded in reestablishing constructive dialogue , President [PER Medvedev  ] and PM [PER Putin  ] had rebuffed [MISC British  ] Embassy feelers for meetings with the Foreign Secretary . 
According to [MISC British  ] diplomats , the [MISC Russians  ] were unsure that the visit wasn’t going to be another round of “slapping them around the face.” The diplomats also credited [PER Medvedev  ] as the driving force in ending the “period of standoff.” <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) During his two-day stay , [PER Miliband  ] dined with [PER Lavrov  ] on Sunday , followed on Monday by working meetings with [PER Lavrov  ] and First Deputy PM [PER Igor Shuvalov  ] . 
[PER Miliband  ] also met with [PER Mikhail Gorbachev  ] , lunched with select eminent politicians and held separate round-tables with [MISC Russian  ] [ORG NGOs  ] and the [MISC British  ] business community ( including [ORG TNK-BP  ] ) . 
[PER Miliband  ] and [PER Lavrov  ] issued three joint statements regarding the 2010 [ORG Review Conference for Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  ] ( [ORG NPT  ] ) , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and the [LOC Middle East Peace Process ( MEPP  ] ) . 
International Agenda -------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) START Follow-On: [PER Lavrov  ] was reportedly upbeat regarding START follow-on negotiations . 
According to [MISC British  ] diplomats , [PER Lavrov  ] said the key issues involved conventional weapons on [MISC ICBMs  ] , verification , and the “numbers gap , ” which was being narrowed . 
Following this treaty , [PER Lavrov  ] suggested multilateral negotiations on further reductions involving the P5 , the [PER D3  ] ( [LOC Israel  ] , [LOC India  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] ) as well as “dormant” nuclear powers such as [LOC Japan  ] . 
He also called for close [MISC Russian-British  ] cooperation across the arms-control agenda: the [ORG NPT  ] , [MISC Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty  ] and [ORG Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty  ] . 
CFE was not discussed . 
The sides issued a joint statement on the [ORG NPT  ] , calling for efforts to ensure the 2010 review conference reinvigorated and strengthened it , and noting that an “agreement before the end of the year on a new legally binding treaty to further reduce [MISC Russian  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] strategic offensive weapons will be a major contribution to this shared endeavor.” The statement also said that both sides were committed to “ensuring the [ORG IAEA  ] has the necessary authority and capacity to assure compliance with non-proliferation obligations.” <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Iran: [PER Lavrov  ] claimed [LOC Russia  ] had no prior knowledge of the [LOC Qom  ] facility and said the [MISC S300  ] deal was in a “holding pattern.” Regarding the [ORG IAEA  ] negotiations , [PER Lavrov  ] agreed with [MISC Miliband’s  ] call for continued unity among the 5 plus 1 group and was ready to discuss the substance of a “freeze for freeze” deal . 
According to [MISC British  ] diplomats , [PER Lavrov  ] was slippery about sanctions , saying “we’re ready to consider applying sanctions if necessary , but it’s too early.” [PER Lavrov  ] reportedly added that if sanctions are agreed at the [ORG UNSC  ] , there shouldn’t be additional unilateral sanctions and sanctions should be limited to “officials” and the nuclear program . 
[LOC MOSCOW  ] 00002734 002 OF 003 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Afghanistan: [PER Lavrov  ] conveyed that [LOC Russia  ] wanted [ORG NATO  ] to stay and to succeed . 
He made the usual pitch for formal [ORG CSTO  ] consultations with [ORG NATO  ] and for [LOC Russia  ] to have a seat at the table of “troop contributing” countries . 
In the joint statement , the sides condemned the Taliban’s attempts to disrupt the [MISC Afghan  ] electoral process and destabilize the country . 
The statement “noted” the [MISC Afghan  ] government’s attempts to reintegrate former fighters , but said that the two governments remained committed to [ORG UNSCR  ] 1267 . 
The [LOC UK  ] and [LOC Russia  ] also made a non-specific commitment to explore opportunities for cooperation in counter-narcotics , which [MISC British  ] diplomats said will be pursued at the working level. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) MEPP: The joint statement urged “Israel to immediately end all settlement activities , including in [LOC East Jerusalem  ] , and to allow access to the [LOC Gaza  ] Strip.” The statement also endorsed the work of the [LOC U.S.  ] and the Quartet and restated support for the [MISC Russian  ] [LOC Moscow  ] conference proposal . 
[MISC British  ] diplomats , however , said that it was clear [ORG GOR  ] officials knew the conference would not happen soon. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) NATO/European Security: [PER Miliband  ] reaffirmed that [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] remained on the [ORG NATO  ] membership track and rejected [MISC Russia’s  ] concept of a “sphere of privileged interests.” [PER Lavrov  ] was on the defensive and sought to redefine privileged interests to mean closer bilateral relations , which [LOC Russia  ] sought to develop with a range of countries , not just those in the [ORG CIS  ] . 
[PER Miliband  ] rebuffed Lavrov’s calls for a new [MISC European  ] security treaty , saying he understood [LOC Russia  ] feels uncomfortable but that it was too early for a new treaty ; he urged [LOC Russia  ] to work this through the OSCE’s “Corfu process.” <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) WTO/Climate Change: Deputy PM [PER Igor Shuvalov  ] told [PER Miliband  ] that he had offered the [LOC U.S.  ] a return to the bilateral negotiating track to facilitate Russis’s WTO accession . 
[PER Shuvalov  ] proposed this during his September visit to [LOC Washington  ] , but claimed that the [LOC U.S.  ] refused . 
[PER Miliband  ] lobbied [PER Shuvalov  ] to increase [MISC Russia’s  ] carbon-reduction commitments from its current offer of 15 percent by 2020 . 
[PER Shuvalov  ] said the [MISC Russian  ] position was not cast in stone , but the [ORG GOR  ] did not want to be tied to targets that would then restrict the expected surge in [MISC Russia’s  ] economic growth in the coming decade . 
Bilateral Issues ---------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) In addition to the joint statements , some progress was made on bilateral economic ties . 
Foremost was the November 5 visit of Finance Minister [PER Aleksey Kudrin  ] to [LOC London  ] as part of the bilateral financial working group , during which [PER Kudrin  ] is expected to pitch the sale of Eurobonds to fill part of [MISC Russia’s  ] projected 2010 budget deficit . 
The sides had to “agree to disagree” on the more thorny bilateral issues that have poisoned the relationship for the past five years: the [MISC British  ] extradition request for [PER Andrey Lugovoi  ] related to the murder of former [ORG FSB  ] officer [PER Aleksadr Litvenenko  ] ( Nov. 1 was the third anniversary of the murder ) , and [MISC Russian  ] extradition requests for [MISC Russian  ] tycoon [PER Boris Berezovskiy  ] and [MISC Chechen  ] leader [PER Akhmed Zakayev  ] . 
Lingering in the background were the tit-for-tat expulsions of [MISC British  ] and [MISC Russian  ] diplomats over the “rock incident , ” the closure of the [ORG British Council’s  ] offices in [LOC St. Petersburg  ] and [LOC Yekaterinburg  ] , the handling of the [ORG TNK-BP  ] management dispute , and the prior harassment of [MISC British  ] diplomats by [MISC Nashi  ] youth activists at the presumed behest of [MISC Russian  ] officials . 
That said , [MISC British  ] diplomats noted that [PER Lavrov  ] and [PER Miliband  ] agreed to step up cultural relations ( especially in 2011 ) to make up for the decrease in [ORG British Council  ] programs . 
[MISC British  ] diplomats believed that there was an understanding that the [ORG British Council  ] would take the lead in these activities , but the technicalities were not discussed . 
Comment ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) While [LOC Russia  ] and the [LOC UK  ] found some common ground during [MISC Miliband’s  ] visit , there was a lingering hesitancy on the [MISC Russian  ] side , demonstrated by the lack of solid deliverables and the unavailability of the tandem , [PER Putin  ] and [PER Medvedev  ] . 
The [ORG GOR  ] could have gone further in offering the [LOC UK  ] transit ( either land or air ) to support [MISC British  ] operations in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but hedged . 
Although [MISC Miliband’s  ] visit followed many working-level and even senior-level meetings on the sidelines of international conferences , it was clear that the [ORG GOR  ] lowered expectations in the event the tone of the visit returned to that following the 2008 [MISC Georgian-Russian  ] war . 
The [MISC Russian  ] press added into the mix the possibility that [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00002734 003 OF 003 [PER Miliband  ] was in [LOC Moscow  ] to demonstrate that he could talk to “even the most difficult of partners , ” thereby burnishing his credentials for a future post with the [ORG EU  ] . 
If that was the case , the [ORG GOR  ] has done little to assist him .
