( [ORG SBU  ] ) Chancellor [PER Angela Merkel  ] nominated [PER Baden- Wuerttemberg  ] ( [ORG BW  ] ) Minister President [PER Guenther Oettinger  ] as [ORG EU  ] Energy Commissioner primarily to remove an unloved lame duck from an important [MISC CDU  ] bastion . 
The move was not the promotion of a valued colleague as [PER Merkel  ] 's allies sought to portray it . 
Rather , [PER Oettinger  ] 's increasing loss of party support in [ORG BW  ] compelled [PER Merkel  ] to push [PER Oettinger  ] out to protect her support base there . 
[PER Oettinger  ] is noted for a lackluster public speaking style , and some commentators have asserted that [PER Merkel  ] , who has often stood out at [ORG EU  ] meetings , wanted to appoint a [MISC German  ] Commissioner who would not outshine her. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Germany  ] has a time-honored tradition of sending unwanted politicians to the [ORG EU  ] Commission , although departing [ORG SPD EU Industry  ] Commissioner [PER Guenter Verheugen  ] proved his worth during his tenure . 
[PER Oettinger  ] has criticized [PER Merkel  ] for her policy stances ( on federal support to [ORG Opel  ] and on generous subsidies to the former eastern states , for instance ) and her purported lack of leadership while antagonizing other influential [MISC CDU  ] leaders . 
In addition to being a poor public speaker , he has a tendency to put his foot in his mouth . 
The best-known example was his ill-advised 2007 defense of a [MISC CDU  ] predecessor as an opponent of the [ORG National Socialist regime  ] , despite his documented pro-Nazi war record . 
Nonetheless , [PER Oettinger  ] is said by industry sources in [LOC Baden-Wuerttemberg  ] to be an efficient behind-the-scenes negotiator. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [PER Merkel  ] was criticized for choosing the energy portfolio , which many derided as too insignificant for [LOC Germany  ] . 
[PER Werner Langen  ] , [LOC CDU/CSU  ] caucus spokesman in the [ORG EU  ] Parliament , said the portfolio has " lost significance . 
" Prominent [LOC Green Member  ] of the [MISC European  ] Parliament , [PER Reinhard Buetikofer  ] characterized it as " not particularly influential , " and [PER Der Spiegel  ] called it a " makeshift job . 
" The [ORG EU  ] Energy Commissioner is responsible for issues such as supply security , energy R&D and efficiency , competition in the gas and electricity markets , infrastructure and low carbon technologies . 
However , key issues such as energy security and climate change are not in the portfolio ; nor will [PER Oettinger  ] take over the role of [ORG EU  ] Commission Vice President from [LOC Verheugen.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [PER Oettinger  ] has an academic background in law and economics and professional experience as a tax consultant and accountant . 
His political expertise is in media policy . 
His background in energy appears limited to public support for nuclear power and the extension of power plant operating licenses . 
His pro-nuclear stance is in stark contrast to many other [MISC German  ] politicians , who support the phase out of nuclear power . 
This endears him to the [ORG EU  ] , which is focused on diversification of energy sources and does not exclude nuclear energy . 
Nuclear power plants supply most of [ORG BW  ] 's energy while renewable energy and fossil fuels do not play a significant role . 
[PER Oettinger  ] has not expressed interest to date in energy issues other than nuclear . 
His priorities in his list submitted to the [ORG EU  ] Parliament in the run up to the January hearings of the candidate [ORG Commission  ] are reportedly vague. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Parliamentarians , skeptical of several members of the new [ORG Commission  ] , are likely to display particular interest in [PER Oettinger  ] 's views on binding energy efficiency targets and encouraging more competition in internal energy markets . 
Although [LOC Germany  ] has embraced a controversial domestic goal of increasing energy efficiency by 20% by 2020 , it has yet to translate the [ORG EU  ] energy efficiency directive into national law . 
[LOC Germany  ] has also steadfastly opposed liberalization of its power sector oligopoly ( what [LOC Brussels  ] calls " unbundling " ) although individual [MISC German  ] companies are slowly moving in that direction . 
[PER Oettinger  ] 's stance on the internal energy market will also be of particular interest to [MISC European  ] parliamentarians , who see [LOC France  ] , and particularly [MISC French  ] power giant [ORG EdF  ] , as a major barrier to opening up the market . 
[ORG EdF  ] is a major share-holder in [ORG BW  ] regional energy supplier [ORG ENBW  ] , which operates the state 's nuclear power plants -- and with which [PER Oettinger  ] is known to have warm relations .
