( [ORG SBU  ] ) On December 3 , Science Counselor and Science Officer met with the [ORG Brazilian Ministry of Exterior Relations'  ] Director of the [ORG Division for Disarmament and Sensitive Technology  ] , [PER Min  ] . 
[PER Santiago Mourao  ] , to deliver the points in REFTEL A concerning the effort to reach a consensus on the [ORG USG  ] non-proliferation proposal at the [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group  ] ( NSG ) before December 12 . 
[PER Mourao  ] said that the [ORG Government of Brazil  ] ( [ORG GOB  ] ) doesn't have a definitive response yet and hopefully would have one - a positive one - next week. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Mourao  ] said he was in frequent contact on this matter with [PER Richard Goorevich  ] of the [ORG National Nuclear Security Administration  ] ( [ORG NNSA  ] ) . 
He explained that the issue for the [ORG GOB  ] is how to make clear that the present [ORG Brazilian-Argentine  ] arrangement with the [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency  ] ( [ORG IAEA  ] ) , which references the [ORG Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials  ] ( [LOC Agencia Brasileiro-Argentina de Contabilidade e Controle de  ] [PER Materiais Nucleares  ] or [ORG ABACC  ] ) , is covered by the proposal on transfer of enrichment and reprocessing ( ENR ) technology . 
Presumably , [PER Mourao  ] is referring to the language in Paragraph 6 ( ii ) of the proposal to the [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group  ] ( NSG ) . 
He said in his mind that the language would cover the existing situation for [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] , but that others ( unidentified ) in the [ORG GOB  ] wanted to make the point absolutely clear . 
They want to leave no doubt that [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] do not have to make any changes to qualify. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Mourao  ] was focusing on methods to make definitely clear that the [ORG Brazil-Argentina ABACC  ] arrangement - as is - would be satisfactory . 
The [ORG GOB  ] was not seeking to make changes to the language of the proposal itself . 
He mentioned the possibility of getting something on the record to that effect as part of a President 's statement. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In addition , [PER Mourao  ] noted that Minister of Defense [PER Nelson Jobim  ] should be able to respond to inquiries about this matter during his December 4-5 visit to the [LOC United States  ] . 
However , [PER Mourao  ] doubted that [PER Min  ] . 
[PER Jobim  ] would have a different answer than the one [PER Mourao  ] gave . 
He did recognize that raising the issue with [PER Min  ] . 
[PER Jobim  ] would underscore the importance the [ORG U.S. Government  ] places on reaching a consensus by December 12 . 
[PER Mourao  ] said that the [ORG GOB  ] wanted to reach a consensus by then too. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) COMMENT . 
The [ORG GOB  ] from the highest levels on down is aware of the [ORG USG  ] desire to advance this proposal as quickly as possible . 
( See REFTEL B ) It appears that with some reassurances on the side ( i.e. , not directly in the language of the proposal ) about the implications of the language for the [ORG Brazil-Argentina ABACC  ] arrangement the [ORG GOB  ] should be on board . 
END COMMENT .
