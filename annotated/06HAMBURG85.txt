[LOC Hamburg  ] police continue to examine where [PER Kovtun  ] was and what he did while in [LOC Germany  ] , but are not yet able to confirm if [PER Kovtun  ] was transporting polonium or if he had been contaminated through contact with the substance prior to his arrival in [LOC Hamburg  ] on October 28 . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Pol/Econ Off and [PER FSN Investigator  ] met [LOC Hamburg  ] [ORG LKA  ] Criminal [ORG Investigation Department  ] ( [ORG CID  ] ) Officer and director of this special investigation [PER Thomas Menzel  ] December 14 . 
[PER Menzel  ] , who is also Director of the [LOC Hamburg  ] [MISC LKA Organized Crime Unit  ] , explained that the [LOC Hamburg  ] investigation started because officers on his team drawing from press reports recognized a connection between the [PER Litvinenko  ] case and the flight from [LOC Hamburg  ] to [LOC London  ] and began to investigate whether [PER Kovtun  ] or [PER Andrei Lugovoi  ] had been in [LOC Hamburg  ] . 
They discovered that [PER Kovtun  ] was a registered resident at the multi-family building at [ORG Erzberger Strasse  ] 4 in Hamburg’s Ottensen neighborhood and that he had flown to [LOC Hamburg  ] on October 28 on an [MISC Aeroflot  ] flight from [LOC Moscow  ] . 
[PER Menzel  ] reported [LOC Hamburg  ] authorities are working closely with the [ORG Federal Office of Criminal Investigation  ] ( [ORG BKA  ] ) and is receiving assistance from the [ORG Federal Central Support Unit  ] and the [ORG Federal Office of Radiation Protection  ] . 
[PER Menzel  ] stated that [PER Stuart Goodwin  ] from [ORG Scotland Yard  ] has been in [LOC Hamburg  ] since December 12 and that cooperation between the [MISC British  ] and [LOC Hamburg  ] police has been excellent . 
While the [ORG BKA  ] and various [MISC German  ] agencies are involved in the investigation , [PER Menzel  ] confirmed that [LOC Hamburg  ] is leading the inquiry. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The investigation’s main focus is to uncover Kovtun’s whereabouts between October 28 and November 1 and to discover any polonium-contaminated sites in the [LOC Hamburg  ] region . 
[PER Menzel  ] reported that the investigation has revealed: - [PER Kovtun  ] arrived in [LOC Hamburg  ] October 28 on the [MISC Aeroflot  ] flight from [LOC Moscow  ] and was picked up from the airport in a [ORG BMW  ] . 
He spent that night at the apartment of [PER Marina Wall  ] , his [MISC Russian/German  ] ex-wife , at [ORG Erzberger Strasse  ] 4 . 
[PER Kovtun  ] has two apartments in the [ORG Erzberger Strasse  ] building , his ex-wife’s residence and another apartment . 
Neighbors told police that he had not used the second apartment for years and it has been rented to other tenants . 
[LOC Wall’s  ] apartment has tested positive for polonium. - On October 29 , [PER Kovtun  ] spent the night at a house in [LOC Haselau  ] outside of [LOC Hamburg  ] , which is where police found the [ORG BMW  ] . 
Both the [LOC Haselau  ] residence and the [ORG BMW  ] are contaminated with polonium. - On October 30 , [PER Kovtun  ] kept an appointment with the [ORG Office of Foreigner Registration  ] in [LOC Hamburg-Altona  ] , where he signed a document . 
His signature has tested positive for radiation . 
After visiting several locations in [LOC Hamburg  ] , including a restaurant and gambling hall , [PER Kovtun  ] spent the night at the home of an [MISC Italian  ] acquaintance on [ORG Kieler Strasse  ] in [LOC Hamburg  ] . 
None of these locations have tested positive for polonium. - [PER Kovtun  ] again spent the night of October 31 at [LOC Wall’s  ] apartment on [ORG Erzberger Strasse  ] . 
He departed by taxi for the airport early on November 1 and flew to [LOC London  ] on the 6:40 am GermanWings flight. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Menzel  ] said the investigation is looking into several unanswered questions . 
[LOC Hamburg  ] police are trying to discover whether [PER Kovtun  ] visited [LOC Hamburg  ] prior to October 28 and where he was between November 1 and the date he arrived in [LOC Moscow  ] . 
They are also looking into whether [PER Lugovoi  ] or any of the other individuals involved in the [PER Litvinenko  ] case have been to [LOC Hamburg  ] in the recent past and have requested airlines to review their passenger lists . 
Other remaining questions concern whether there are any further contaminated locations in [LOC Hamburg  ] or other parts of [LOC Germany  ] . 
Investigators hope to find out more about [PER Kovtun  ] as an individual - what he did for a living , what his personal background was , and whether he had worked at the [MISC Russian  ] Consulate in [LOC Hamburg  ] in the past . 
Finally , [PER Menzel  ] was curious about a possible [MISC Italian  ] connection to the [PER Litvinenko  ] [LOC HAMBURG  ] 00000085 002.2 OF 002 case and noted that [PER Kovtun  ] had met with an [MISC Italian  ] national in [LOC Hamburg  ] and that [MISC Italians  ] played a role in the [LOC London  ] investigation as well. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG Federal Interior Minister Deputy DG for Counterterrorism Gerhard Schindler  ] discussed the status of the [MISC German  ] investigation during a meeting on other topics with EMIN December 14 . 
[PER Schindler  ] explained [MISC German  ] officials retraced Kovtun’s steps to and from his ex-wife’s home in [LOC Hamburg  ] . 
[PER Schindler  ] said [PER Kovtun  ] left polonium traces on everything he touched - vehicles , objects , clothes , and furniture . 
[MISC German  ] investigators concluded [PER Kovtun  ] did not have polonium traces on his skin or clothes ; [PER Schindler  ] said the polonium was coming out of his body , for example through his pores . 
[MISC German  ] authorities had tested the [MISC German  ] Wings airplane that had taken [PER Kovtun  ] from [LOC Hamburg  ] to [LOC London  ] ; no traces of polonium were found . 
[LOC Germany  ] had wanted to test the [MISC Aeroflot  ] plane that flew [PER Kovtun  ] to [LOC Germany  ] , and had prepared to ground it upon its next arrival in [LOC Germany  ] . 
[PER Schindler  ] said [MISC Russian  ] authorities must have found out about [MISC German  ] plans because “at the last minute” [MISC Aeroflot  ] swapped planes ; [PER Schindler  ] said he did not expect [MISC Aeroflot  ] to fly the other plane to [LOC Germany  ] any time soon. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 .
