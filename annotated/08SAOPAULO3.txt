SUMMARY: Assistant Secretary of State for the [ORG Bureau of Economic , Energy  ] , and [ORG Business Affairs  ] , [PER Daniel Sullivan  ] held a roundtable on biofuels developments on December 12 at the [ORG American Chamber of Commerce  ] in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
Biofuels interlocutors applauded the [ORG USG  ] 's progress on the [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] Memorandum of Understanding ( [ORG MOU  ] ) , but lamented that [LOC Brazil  ] 's private sector has been more active than the [MISC Brazilian  ] government on many biofuels initiatives . 
The assembled group told [PER A/S Sullivan  ] that the number one roadblock to furthering worldwide ethanol expansion is the lack of information for industry and consumers especially in how to utilize and commoditize ethanol . 
Post will continue working on ways to engage the private sector in advancing the [ORG MOU  ] . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
[PER Alfred Szwarc  ] , an adviser to the Board of the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Sugar Cane Industry Union  ] ( [ORG UNICA  ] ) , lamented that the [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] [ORG MOU  ] had not moved more quickly , but noted that he thought both sides had made significant progress on standardization , as well as some efforts at establishing the framework for making ethanol a commodity . 
[ Note: [ORG UNICA  ] is the leading sugarcane agribusiness association in [LOC Brazil  ] with 100 members , representing 50 percent of the total production of sugar cane , sugar , and ethanol . 
End Note . 
] [PER Szwarc  ] was part of a November scientific visit to the [LOC U.S.  ] and commended both sides on developing an ongoing scientific exchange , but noted there should be further advancement on including third party countries into the process . 
[PER A/S Sullivan  ] concurred that the most progress had been on issues where the two governments had a leading role and noted that public-private integration can potentially delay implementation , but underscored the importance of the private sector in expanding ethanol as a global commodity. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
Commercial Manager for [ORG Coimex Trading Company Manfred  ] Wefers outlined [ORG Coimex  ] 's role as a [MISC Brazilian  ] logistics company specializing in logistics , imports , exports , and infrastructure development . 
He briefed [PER A/S Sullivan  ] on [ORG Coimex  ] 's progress in building the world 's largest private container terminal which will include a liquid terminal for ethanol storage at [LOC Santos  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] 's largest port . 
He also outlined [ORG Coimex  ] 's plan to build a [LOC U.S.  ] port terminal for imports of ethanol either in [LOC Tampa  ] , [LOC Savannah  ] , or [LOC Jacksonville  ] . 
[ORG Coimex  ] is banking on the continued growth of ethanol consumption and sees the near absence of ethanol storage and filling containers in the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Southeast  ] as an opportunity . 
Wefers stated that these facilities could receive ethanol at a competitive price from [LOC Jamaica  ] and other [ORG Caribbean Basin Initiative  ] countries where [ORG Coimex  ] has production and dehydration facilities . 
In [LOC Jamaica  ] , [ORG Coimex  ] has worked with the [MISC Jamaican  ] government ( [ORG GOJ  ] ) to promote the use of gasoline blending to include five percent ethanol , which he said the [ORG GOJ  ] hopes to implement next year. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
[PER Plinio Nastari  ] , President of [ORG Datagro Publications Ltd.  ] , gave a brief regional overview for [PER A/S Sullivan  ] . 
He discussed his work in [LOC Central America  ] to encourage production , noting that [LOC El Salvador  ] has been very receptive , as well as some initial signs of interest in [LOC Honduras  ] and [LOC Guatemala  ] . 
[PER Sullivan  ] highlighted that [ORG CAFTA  ] countries exports of ethanol have increased by 400 percent because of the duty free access , and lauded [LOC El Salvador  ] 's efforts on implementing ethanol gasoline blending . 
[ Note: Datagro is recognized by many as the top industry newsletter for the sugar and ethanol sector in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[PER Nastari  ] is also President of [PER Plinio Nastari  ] Consulting ( [ORG PNCP  ] ) , which provides consulting services to sugar mills , trading companies , and the [MISC Brazilian  ] government .

[PER Nastari  ] urged [PER A/S Sullivan  ] to convey to [LOC Washington  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] needs to signal to these countries the potential market for ethanol production . 
He suggested three concrete ways the [LOC U.S.  ] could help in developing an ethanol market . 
First , he recommended the [ORG USG  ] support , through USAID or [ORG World Bank  ] , specific consulting projects that would put planned projects into action . 
Secondly , he underscored the need for the [ORG USG  ] to encourage private sector development of a liquid futures market for ethanol . 
Finally , he urged [PER A/S Sullivan  ] to support the inclusion of ethanol as an [ORG SAO PAULO  ] 00000003 002 OF 002 environmentally friendly product within the [ORG WTO  ] . 
6 . 
In response to [PER A/S Sullivan  ] 's request to define the largest roadblock to furthering ethanol expansion , [PER Nastari  ] said the lack of information and insufficient marketing left consumers and industry unaware of some basic facts regarding ethanol . 
As an example , he pointed out the fact that any car can use up to ten percent ethanol blend without any modifications to the engine . 
He also noted many potential producing countries erroneously compare sugar cane prices to ethanol prices instead of molasses to ethanol when making investment decisions . 
He noted molasses producers should be producing ethanol as well because the profit comparison for molasses and ethanol is much more advantageous for ethanol while with sugar it is not as advantageous. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
[PER Pedro Bentacourt  ] from [ORG General Motors  ] ( [ORG GM  ] ) highlighted that in the last five years [MISC Brazilian  ] sales of flex fuel cars totaled almost 2.5 million cars . 
He noted that [ORG GM Brazil  ] 's CEO is leading a subgroup within the industry to develop standardization and development of ethanol as a global commodity . 
[ORG GM  ] is very open to working with others , to the point of disclosing technology to improve market access , he said . 
[PER Bentacourt  ] agreed with [PER Nastari  ] that the biggest roadblock in addition to developing infrastructure and industry standards is accurate and widespread access to information . 
He said [ORG GM  ] developed a campaign in the [LOC U.S.  ] to encourage gas stations to expand capacity for ethanol pumps at its own expense , but the lack of infrastructure and understanding of the market is a big roadblock for them. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
COMMENT: Ethanol industry interlocutors provided a frank discussion for [PER A/S Sullivan  ] outlining their concerns about delays in implementation of the [ORG MOU  ] ; however , they agreed with the Assistant Secretary that the bilateral initiative is moving more quickly than SIPDIS anticipated . 
Their collective comments on the need to improve information and infrastructure in [LOC Brazil  ] ring true . 
Post will continue to engage the private and public sectors on biofuels issues and in advancing progress on the [ORG MOU  ] . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
This cable was coordinated with [PER A/S Sullivan  ] 's delegation .
