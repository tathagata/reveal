XXXXXXXXXXXX [PER Sesay  ] was questioned by the [LOC Sierra Leone Police  ] ( SLP ) August 5 , but the SLP had orders from the President to neither charge nor detain him . 
This runs counter to [MISC Koroma’s  ] public and private statements which have said he will hold anyone connected to the cocaine bust accountable , regardless of their connections . 
Also , following an Embassy offer August 1 , the [ORG GoSL  ] has accepted and offer for [ORG DEA  ] to assistance in the investigation , and possible help with the deportation of the accused . 
End Summary . 
Minister Fired -------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The repercussions of the July 13 cocaine bust at [LOC Lungi Airport  ] ( reftel A ) continue to be felt , with Minister of [ORG Transportation and Aviation  ] [PER Ibrahim Kemoh Sesay  ] relieved of his duties August 4 . 
According to a State House press statement , this action was taken to facilitate the investigation and provide “unfettered access to everyone and everywhere the investigations demand.” [PER Sesay  ] stated in a radio interview August 5 that he “expects to land on his feet” following the conclusion of the investigation , inferring that he will resume his ministerial duties at that time. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Sesay’s removal from power is not a surprise . 
Media reports have called for his resignation since the bust , in large part due to the arrest of his cousin ( Note: Media reports refer to them as brothers , but this reflects the [MISC African  ] tradition of brotherhood that extends beyond immediate family . 
End note ) , [PER Mohamed Sesay  ] . 
The media have reflected the public sentiment that , at the very least , the close familial relationship between the two makes it hard for the Minister to be impartial during the investigation . 
[PER Kemoh Sesay  ] has frequently declared his innocence and willingness to allow the investigation to occur without influence or interference. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX the President directly ordered SLP senior officers to refrain from arresting [PER Kemoh Sesay  ] . 
Instead , he was brought in for questioning and released on August 5 , with subsequent questioning expected August 6 . 
The SLP intend to convince the President to sanction his arrest , and in the meantime have [PER Kemoh Sesay  ] under constant surveillance . 
Since he is considered a flight risk , warnings were sent out to all exit points , including the airport . 
Despite these measures , known corruption at the borders makes it nearly impossible to prevent escape. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [PER Sesay  ] “brothers” are [ORG APC  ] stalwarts with close ties to the President . 
[PER Kemoh Sesay  ] was originally elected as a Member of Parliament in 1996 as an [ORG SLPP  ] party member , but switched allegiances to the [ORG APC  ] during the 2002 elections . 
He was elected [ORG MP  ] in the [LOC Port Loko District  ] in 2007 and resigned this position to become Minister . 
[PER Mohamed Sesay  ] , not considered competent or educated enough to be a politician , was one of the key financial backers of the 2007 Presidential campaign . 
His contributions during the election , according to rumor , earned the ministerial position for [PER Kemoh Sesay  ] and the Manager position of the national football team for himself . 
If the allegations are true , these positions were strategically selected and likely used to facilitate narcotics trafficking beyond this particular case . 
[ORG DEA  ] Help Accepted ----------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Following an official USG offer made by diplomatic note on 1 August , the [ORG GoSL  ] accepted [ORG DEA  ] assistance and held a joint DEA-GoSL meeting August 6 , chaired by [ORG Office of National Security General Kellie Conte  ] . 
[ORG Conte  ] and [ORG GoSL  ] officials made clear their fear that the traffickers could corrupt lover-level judiciary and police officials , and hoped that the [ORG DEA  ] could indict and remove the traffickers from [LOC Sierra Leone  ] as quickly as possible . 
The attendees at the meeting also agreed that an additional [ORG DEA  ] agent fluent in [MISC Spanish  ] should be sent to [LOC Sierra Leone  ] immediately . 
Post will report further developments regarding [ORG DEA  ] participation septel. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX His stance on [PER Kemoh Sesay’s  ] possible arrest contradicts previously reported information that he intends to see any guilty party brought to justice , regardless of their personal or professional connections . 
This is an unwelcome development , particularly given the importance of [MISC Koroma’s  ] personal integrity and commitment to rule of law in encouraging greater investor and donor confidence . 
On the other hand , [ORG DEA  ] involvement , particularly if it results in the removal of traffickers from [LOC Sierra Leone  ] quickly , helps the President retain his government’s reputation and commitment to the rule of law--before the traffickers use their resources to bribe their way past prison and police officials who make only few dollars a day . 
End comment .
