[PER Bono  ] said he hoped the Ambassador 's [ORG SIPDIS  ] arrival would help further the excellent [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] defense relationship .

[PER Bono  ] said that [LOC Spain  ] had made a decision " favorable to a [LOC U.S.  ] company , " but said he would not announce this decision immediately so that it would not appear to be a quid pro quo for the Tomahawks . 
The Ambassador pressed [PER Bono  ] on the [LOC Venezuela  ] weapons sale , making clear that this was still an issue of contention for the [ORG USG  ] . 
[PER Bono  ] insisted that the naval vessels and aircraft would be non-offensive and would probably not be delivered for another six years , during which time [PER Bono  ] expected [PER Chavez  ] would leave the scene . 
Further , [PER Bono  ] said that if [LOC Spain  ] found that [LOC Venezuela  ] were " pursuing a path against the principles of democracy , " the [ORG GOS  ] would not sell the vessels to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The Ambassador met with [PER Bono  ] at the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] , accompanied by [ORG DCM  ] , Political Counselor [PER Kathy Fitzpatrick  ] , DATT Captain [PER Kevin Little  ] , and [ORG ODC  ] commander Captain [PER Carlos Sotomayor  ] . 
[PER Bono  ] was accompanied by [ORG CHOD General Sanz  ] , Secretary General for [ORG Defense Policy Admiral Francisco Torrente  ] , Army Chief of [ORG Staff General  ] [PER Jose Antonio Garcia Gonzalez  ] , and MOD Chief of [ORG Staff Miguel Fernandez Palacios Martinez  ] . 
[PER Bono  ] said he was very appreciative of the [ORG USG  ] 's warm reception during his early May visit to the [LOC U.S.  ] , which he viewed as a clear signal that [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] defense relations could not be better . 
He was especially pleased with his meeting with Secretary [PER Rumsfeld  ] . 
With the Ambassador 's arrival , [PER Bono  ] said he hoped the excellent relations would continue at the same level. //BILATERAL ISSUES - [LOC CUBA  ] , 3U COMMERCIAL DISPUTE// <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Bono  ] expressed interest in the Ambassador 's [MISC Cuban  ] ancestry . 
The Ambassador shared his experiences growing up in [LOC Cuba  ] and as an immigrant to the [LOC U.S.  ] He said [LOC Cuba  ] was clearly an important issue for the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] , but only one of many that he would deal with during his tenure in [LOC Madrid  ] . 
The Ambassador noted that the most important point on [LOC Cuba  ] was that both the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] believed in a free [LOC Cuba  ] that would promote democratic values in the region . 
He cited the [ORG USG  ] 's disagreement with [LOC Spain  ] 's move to block [ORG EU  ] invitations to national day events , saying that while it appeared to be a minor issue , it sent the wrong message and demoralized the opposition. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Bono  ] raised the issue of the [LOC U.S.  ] commercial vessel , the " 3U . 
" He said the [ORG MFA  ] had requested that the MOD be prepared to board the 3U since it was conducting operations in [MISC Spanish  ] waters in disregard of [MISC Spanish  ] sovereignty . 
[ORG DCM  ] explained that there was a discrepancy between the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOS  ] views on this issue , since we believed the 3U was operating appropriately as a commercial vessel , while the [ORG MFA  ] insisted it was a scientific vessel and required [ORG GOS  ] authorization in order to proceed with its plans to lay cable through [MISC Spanish  ] waters . 
[ORG DCM  ] said that the [ORG USG  ] had duly requested authorization for the 3U through a note verbale , but that the issue remained in dispute . 
[PER Bono  ] made clear his desire that this issue not become a problem in bilateral defense relations. //BONO - [LOC SPAIN  ] COMMITTED TO DEFENSE COOPERATION// <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Bono  ] described the [ORG USG  ] 's unimpeded access to the [MISC Spanish  ] navy base at [LOC Rota  ] and the air base at [LOC Moron  ] as indications of [LOC Spain  ] 's commitment to defense cooperation , saying the [ORG USG  ] essentially could essentially operate from both bases as if they were its own . 
[PER Bono  ] raised the issue of stalled [ORG USAFE-Spanish Air Force  ] discussions on [LOC Spain  ] 's desire to use some [LOC Moron  ] air base ramp space to park its [ORG Eurofighter  ] aircraft , on the understanding that the [MISC Spanish  ] aircraft would vacate the space if the [LOC U.S.  ] needed full capacity for any contingency . 
The Ambassador said he was aware of the problem and would travel to [LOC Moron  ] the next day to see it for himself . 
He said the issue would be dealt with through appropriate channels. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Bono  ] discussed the upcoming deployment of [MISC Spanish  ] troops to [LOC Afghanistan  ] to co-lead the [ORG Herat FSB  ] , lead a PRT in western [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and provide additional security for the parliamentary elections in the fall . 
[PER Bono  ] said it would be useful if the [ORG USG  ] could provide airlift in the form of four [MISC C-17  ] aircraft to help transport [MISC Spanish  ] forces to the region . 
He said media coverage of such assistance would be an opportunity to showcase the high level of [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] defense cooperation . 
The Ambassador said we appreciated the value of promoting such cooperation and would convey his request to the [ORG Department of Defense.  ] //THANKS FOR THE [MISC TOMAHAWKS  ] , STILL NO [MISC S-80  ] ANNOUNCEMENT// <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Minister [PER Bono  ] said he had received a letter from Secretary [PER Rumsfeld  ] authorizing the transfer of [LOC Tomahawk  ] [ORG SIPDIS  ] missile technology to [LOC Spain  ] . 
The Ambassador said [LOC Spain  ] should be proud of that honor , since we had only shared that technology with two other allies , the [LOC UK  ] and The [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
[PER Bono  ] said he understood this and appreciated the [ORG USG  ] 's confidence in [LOC Spain.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked about the status of the [MISC S-80  ] submarine weapons system contract , in which two [LOC U.S.  ] firms are competing with [MISC French  ] and [MISC German  ] companies . 
[PER Bono  ] responded that [LOC Spain  ] had essentially made the decision already and that it would be favorable to a [LOC U.S.  ] company . 
However , [PER Bono  ] claimed that he wanted to put some distance between the [LOC Tomahawk  ] decision and the [MISC Spanish  ] decision on the [MISC S-80  ] so that the two issues would not appear linked . 
Also , [PER Bono  ] said he planned to attend the [MISC Bastille Day  ] parade in [LOC Paris  ] on July 14 and did not want to disappoint the [MISC French  ] government , which has pushed hard in support of a [MISC French  ] company on the [MISC S-80  ] contract , before that event. //VENEZUELA// <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The Ambassador raised [MISC Spanish  ] arms sales to [LOC Venezuela  ] , noting that we understood that [LOC Spain  ] had already made the commitment to transfer the vessels to [LOC Venezuela  ] , but that the [ORG USG  ] did not share the [ORG Zapatero  ] government 's apparent faith in the [PER Chavez  ] regime to use the weapons for non-offensive use . 
[PER Bono  ] said that he had discussed this issue with Secretary [PER Rumsfeld  ] , noting in that conversation that several countries sold weapons to [LOC Venezuela  ] , including the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Bono  ] asserted that he had explained the [LOC Venezuela  ] arms sale in detail and believed he had satisfied Secretary [PER Rumsfeld  ] 's concerns . 
The Ambassador said that , notwithstanding [PER Bono  ] 's conversation with Secretary [PER Rumsfeld  ] , there was still deep concern regarding this issue at the highest levels of the [ORG USG  ] . 
[PER Bono  ] said that the media had mischaracterized the nature of the items being sold to [LOC Venezuela  ] , insisting that they would be non-offensive transport aircraft and coastal patrol vessels . 
The Ambassador said the [ORG USG  ] would look very skeptically on any transfer of [ORG USG  ] technology to [LOC Venezuela  ] as part of this sale . 
[PER Bono  ] responded that since the vessels would be built as coastal patrol ships and not as military vessels , the would not carry any [LOC U.S.  ] technology of concern. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) On [LOC Venezuela  ] 's political direction and possible role in undermining regional stability , [PER Bono  ] asserted that [LOC Spain  ] had the same fundamental concerns as the [ORG USG  ] . 
He said that if [LOC Spain  ] determined that the [PER Chavez  ] government was " pursuing a path that is against the principle of democracy that both the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] share , " the [ORG GOS  ] would not sell the weapons to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[PER Bono  ] said that the actual transfer of the weapons would not take place for six years and he speculated that it was highly unlikely that [PER Chavez  ] would still be in power by that time .
