End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Polcouns  ] met with [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] politician [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] at the [MISC Catholic Bishops Conference  ] facility in [LOC Bogota  ] on May 14 . 
The [ORG GOC  ] was aware of the meeting , which was organized and attended by [ORG National Conciliation Commission  ] Secretary-General [PER Father Dario Echeverri  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [ORG FARC  ] Secretariat member [PER Jorge Torres Victoria  ] ( [PER Pablo Catatumbo  ] ) , his primary [ORG FARC  ] contact , had encouraged him to establish contact with the [ORG Embassy  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stressed that he did not bring a message from the [ORG FARC  ] for the [ORG USG  ] , but said he wanted to establish a " relationship " with the [ORG Embassy  ] that could prove useful in the future . 
He said [PER Catatumbo  ] is convinced that [ORG USG  ] participation in any eventual peace process with the [ORG GOC  ] would be key to success . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was authorized by the [ORG GOC  ] to transmit messages to the [ORG FARC  ] from July 2008 until March 2009 . 
[ORG FARC  ] PLAYING POLITICS WITH HOSTAGES ----------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said there is nothing humanitarian about the [ORG FARC  ] 's recent hostage releases . 
The [ORG FARC  ] released the hostages to regain some political visibility and relieve itself of the economic and security costs incurred in holding them . 
Several [ORG FARC  ] commanders have openly complained to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that the hostages are a growing burden due to [MISC Colombian  ] military pressure . 
He said the [ORG FARC Secretariat  ] realizes that [PER Uribe  ] will never agree to a humanitarian accord , but wants to continue with the releases to maximize the political impact . 
Still , he felt the [ORG FARC  ] will not free any more hostages unilaterally unless [PER Uribe  ] reverses his current stance and allows Senator [PER Piedad Cordoba  ] to participate . 
TIME NOT RIPE FOR PEACE TALKS ----------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] said conditions are not ripe for [MISC GOC-FARC  ] talks aimed at starting peace negotiations due to the on-going presidential election campaign and the deep distrust on both sides . 
Still , he said that at an appropriate moment in the future , a gesture from the [ORG USG  ] to the [ORG FARC  ] , such as allowing a representative of a [LOC U.S.  ] non-governmental organization to accompany a meeting between the [ORG GOC  ] and the [ORG FARC  ] , could provide an impetus to start talks. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he worked with then Peace Commissioner [PER Luis Carlos Restrepo  ] in early 2008 to develop and implement projects targeting the rural ( campesino ) population in [LOC Valle de Cauca  ] , with [ORG FARC  ] knowledge and consent . 
He noted that [PER Catatumbo  ] had even facilitated some of the [ORG GOC  ] 's meetings with campesino leaders . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also claimed he worked to develop a similar project in southern [LOC Tolima  ] , but said the effort stalled due to opposition from then Defense Minister [PER Juan Manuel Santos  ] , who argued that the project was " merely feeding the guerrillas . 
" In contrast , [PER Restrepo  ] believed that working with the campesinos was a way for the [ORG GOC  ] to build confidence and establish contact with the [ORG FARC  ] . 
[ORG FARC  ] LEADERSHIP NOT DIVIDED --------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] dismissed the notion that [ORG FARC Secretariat  ] leaders [PER Guillermo Saenz  ] ( [PER Alfonso Cano  ] ) and [PER Jorge Briceno  ] ( [PER Mono Jojoy  ] ) are rivals , claiming that [PER Jojoy  ] , [PER Cano  ] and [PER Catatumbo  ] are good friends . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] observed that [PER Jojoy  ] lacks [PER Cano  ] 's and [PER Catatumbo  ] 's educational background , but said [PER Jojoy  ] understands that the [ORG FARC  ] 's struggle is political , not military . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] said all three [ORG FARC  ] leaders wanted to drop the [ORG FARC  ] 's demand for a demilitarized zone as a condition for a humanitarian exchange long before [ORG Operation Check  ] ( [ORG Jaque  ] ) , but then [ORG FARC  ] leader [PER Marulanda  ] had refused. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Jojoy  ] accepts [PER Cano  ] 's leadership and supports his effort to develop a more active political strategy . 
He added that while [PER Cano  ] originally was perceived by rank-and-file [ORG FARC  ] as an intellectual rather than a fighter , his ability to survive constant [MISC Colombian  ] military pressure over the last year has begun to enhance his image among [ORG FARC  ] fighters .
