( C ) Summary: PM [PER Erdogan  ] and his ruling [ORG AK Party  ] seem to have a firm grip on power -- if for no other reasons that there is currently no viable alternative and inertia weighs heavily in politics . 
Nevertheless , [PER Erdogan  ] and his party face enormous challenges if they are successfully to embrace core principles of open society , carry out [ORG EU  ] harmonization , and develop and implement foreign policies in harmony with core [LOC U.S.  ] interests . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) As PM [PER Erdogan  ] strode through the [ORG EU  ] corridors of power Dec. 16-17 with his semi-pro soccer player 's swagger and phalanx of sycophantic advisors , he may have seemed a strong candidate for [MISC European  ] leader of the year . 
A regional leader to be reckoned with for a decade to come . 
The man who won [LOC Turkey  ] the beginning of accession negotiations with the [ORG EU  ] . 
Who broke loose three decades of frozen [MISC Turkish  ] policy on [LOC Cyprus  ] . 
Who drove major human rights reforms through parliament and through constitutional amendments . 
Whose rhetorical skill , while etched with populist victimhood , is redolent with traditional and religious allusions that resonate deeply in the heartland , deeply in the anonymous exurban sprawls . 
Who remains the highly popular tribune of the people , without a viable or discernible political rival...outside his own ruling AKP. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In short , [PER Erdogan  ] looks unbeatable . 
But is he ? 
And is he willing to give relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] the leadership and momentum they need from the [MISC Turkish  ] side ? <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Erdogan  ] has a two-thirds majority in parliament . 
Main opposition left-of-center CHP amounts to no more than a bunch of elitist ankle-biters . 
There is currently no serious , broad-based political alternative , owing to [PER Erdogan  ] 's rhetorical dominance and control of the debate on social questions close to the hearts of the center-right majority in [LOC Turkey  ] ; other party leaders' political bankruptcy ; and the stultifying effect of current party and election laws on entry for younger , untainted political aspirants . 
[ORG AKP  ] argues that the economy , at least from the perspective of macro indicators and continued willingness of emerging-market portfolio investors to buy the expectations and sell the facts , appears to have stabilized . 
Moreover , the authority of [ORG AKP  ] 's nationwide party machine is blurring with the [MISC Turkish  ] State 's executive power at the provincial and district level and with municipal functions to an extent not seen since the days of the one-party state . 
These factors seem set to continue for the foreseeable future. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Yet [PER Erdogan  ] and [ORG AKP  ] face politically fateful challenges in three areas: foreign policy ( [ORG EU  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Cyprus  ] ) ; quality and sustainability of leadership and governance ; and resolution of questions fundamental to creation of an open , prosperous society integrated with the broader world ( place of religion ; identity and history ; rule of law ) . 
[ORG EU  ] -- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) [PER Erdogan  ] indexed his political survival to getting a negotiation date from the [ORG EU  ] . 
He achieved that goal . 
The [ORG Wall Street Journal  ] and other [MISC Western  ] and [MISC Turkish  ] media have opined that the [ORG EU  ] owes [LOC Turkey  ] a fair negotiating process leading to accession , with the [ORG Journal  ] even putting the onus on the [ORG EU  ] by asserting that while [LOC Turkey  ] is ready the question is whether [MISC Europeans  ] are ready for [LOC Turkey.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) But there 's always a Monday morning and the debate on the ground here is not so neat . 
With euphoria at getting a date having faded in 48 hours , [PER Erdogan  ] 's political survival and the difficulty of the tasks before him have become substantially clearer . 
Nationalists on right and left have resumed accusations that [PER Erdogan  ] sold out [MISC Turkish  ] national interests ( [LOC Cyprus  ] ) and [MISC Turkish  ] traditions . 
Core institutions of the [MISC Turkish  ] state , which remain at best wary of [ORG AKP  ] , have once again begun to probe for weaknesses and to feed insinuations into the press in parallel with the nationalists' assertions . 
In the face of this [MISC Euro-aversion  ] , neither [PER Erdogan  ] nor his government has taken even minimal steps to prepare the bureaucracy or public opinion to begin tackling the fundamental -- some [LOC Turks  ] would say insidious -- legal , social , intellectual and spiritual changes that must occur to turn harmonization on paper into true reform . 
The road ahead will surely be hard. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) High-profile naysayers like main opposition CHP chairman Baykal , former Ambassador [PER Gunduz Aktan  ] , and political scientist [PER Hasan Unal  ] continue to castigate [PER Erdogan  ] . 
But theirs is a routine whine . 
More significant for us is that many of our contacts cloak their lack of self-confidence at [LOC Turkey  ] 's ability to join in expressions of skepticism that the [ORG EU  ] will let [LOC Turkey  ] in . 
And there is parallel widespread skepticism that the [ORG EU  ] will be around in attractive form in ten years. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The mood in [ORG AKP  ] is no brighter , with one of [PER FonMin Gul  ] 's MFA advisors having described to [LOC UK  ] polcounselor how bruised [LOC Turkey  ] feels at the [ORG EU  ] 's inconsistency during the final negotiations leading to Dec. 17 ( [ORG EU  ] diplomats in [LOC Ankara  ] have given us the other side of the story ) . 
[PER Gul  ] was noticeably harder-line than [PER Erdogan  ] in public comments in the lead-up to the [ORG Summit  ] , and was harder-line in pre-Summit negotiations in [LOC Brussels  ] , according to [LOC UK  ] polcounselor . 
There was noticeable tension between [PER Erdogan  ] and [PER Gul  ] in [LOC Brussels  ] according to " [MISC Aksam  ] " [LOC Ankara  ] bureau chief [PER Nuray Basaran  ] . 
She also noted to us that when negotiations seemed to have frozen up on Dec. 17 , [PER Erdogan  ] 's advisors got phone calls from [MISC Putin  ] advisors urging [LOC Turkey  ] to walk . 
[PER Basaran  ] says that at least some of [PER Erdogan  ] 's advisors urged him to do so. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [ORG AKP  ] 's lack of cohesion as a party and lack of openness as a government is reflected in the range of murky , muddled motives for wanting to join the [ORG EU  ] we have encountered among those AKPers who say they favor pursuing membership...or at least the process . 
Some see the process as the way to marginalize the [MISC Turkish  ] military and what remains of the arid " secularism " of [MISC Kemalism  ] . 
We have also run into the rarely openly-spoken , but widespread belief among adherents of the [MISC Turk-Islam  ] synthesis that [LOC Turkey  ] 's role is to spread [MISC Islam  ] in [LOC Europe  ] , " to take back [LOC Andalusia  ] and avenge the defeat at the siege of [LOC Vienna  ] in 1683 " as one participant in a recent meeting at [ORG AKP  ] 's main think tank put it . 
This thinking parallels the logic behind the approach of [PER FonMin Gul  ] ally and chief foreign policy advisor in the [ORG Prime Ministry  ] [PER Ahmet Davutoglu  ] , whose muddy opinion piece in the Dec. 13 [ORG International Herald Tribune  ] is in essence a call for one-way multi-cultural tolerance , i.e. , on the part of the [ORG EU.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Those from the more overtly religious side of [ORG AKP  ] whinge that the [ORG EU  ] is a [MISC Christian  ] club . 
While some assert that it is only through [MISC Turkish  ] membership and spread of [MISC Turkish  ] values that the world can avoid the clash of civilizations they allege the West is fomenting , others express concern that harmonization and membership will water down [MISC Islam  ] and associated traditions in [LOC Turkey  ] . 
Indeed , as [ORG AKP  ] whip [PER Sadullah Ergin  ] confided to us recently , " If the [ORG EU  ] says yes , everything will look rosy for a short while . 
Then the real difficulties will start for [ORG AKP  ] . 
If the [ORG EU  ] says no , it will be initially difficult , but much easier over the long run . 
" <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [ORG AKP  ] also faces the nuts-and-bolts issue of how to prepare for harmonization . 
In choosing a chief negotiator [PER Erdogan  ] will need to decide whether the risks that the man he taps will successfully steal his political limelight outweigh the political challenge his choice will face since it will be the [MISC Turkish  ] chief negotiator 's responsibility to sell the [ORG EU  ] position to a recalcitrant [MISC Turkish  ] cabinet . 
It is because the chief negotiator is likely to be ground down between [ORG EU  ] demands and a prickly domestic environment that some observers speculate [PER Erdogan  ] might give the job to his chief internal rival [LOC Gul.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) At the same time the government must reportedly hire a couple thousand people skilled in [MISC English  ] or other major [ORG EU  ] languages and up to the bureaucratic demands of interfacing with the [MISC Eurocrats  ] who descend on ministries as harmonization starts . 
If the government continues to hire on the basis of " one of us " , i.e. , from the [MISC Sunni  ] brotherhood and lodge milieu that has been serving as the pool for [ORG AKP  ] 's civil service hiring , lack of competence will be a problem . 
If the government hires on the base of competence , its new hires will be frustrated by the incompetence of [ORG AKP  ] 's previous hires at all levels . 
Questions About [ORG AKP  ] Leadership and [ORG Governance  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Several factors will continue to degrade [PER Erdogan  ] 's and [ORG AKP  ] 's ability to effect fair and lasting reforms or to take timely , positive decisions on issues of importance to the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) First is [PER Erdogan  ] 's character. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) In our contacts in [LOC Anatolia  ] we have not yet detected that [PER Erdogan  ] 's hunger for absolute power and for the material benefits of power have begun to erode his grassroots popularity . 
Others disagree . 
Pollster and political analyst [PER Ismail Yildiz  ] has asserted in three lengthy expositions to us late in Dec. that the erosion has started . 
We note that ( 1 ) [PER Yildiz  ] expressed frustration to us that the [ORG AKP  ] leadership did not respond to his offer to provide political strategy services ; ( 2 ) he is currently connected to mainstream opposition figures ; and ( 3 ) he also runs a conspiracy-theory web site . 
So we treat his view cautiously . 
However , judging by his references and past experience in the [MISC Turkish  ] State , he appears to have maintained conncetions with the State apparatus and to have a network of observers and data collectors in all 81 provinces. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Inside the party , [PER Erdogan  ] 's hunger for power reveals itself in a sharp authoritarian style and deep distrust of others: as a former spiritual advisor to [PER Erdogan  ] and his wife [PER Emine  ] put it , " [PER Tayyip Bey  ] believes in [LOC God...but  ] doesn't trust him . 
" In surrounding himself with an iron ring of sycophantic ( but contemptuous ) advisors , [PER Erdogan  ] has isolated himself from a flow of reliable information , which partially explains his failure to understand the context -- or real facts -- of the [LOC U.S.  ] operations in [PER Tel Afar  ] , [LOC Fallujah  ] , and elsewhere and his susceptibility to [MISC Islamist  ] theories . 
With regard to [MISC Islamist  ] influences on [PER Erdogan  ] , [PER DefMin Gonul  ] , who is a conservative but worldly [MISC Muslim  ] , recently described [PER Gul  ] associate [PER Davutoglu  ] to us as " exceptionally dangerous . 
" [PER Erdogan  ] 's other foreign policy advisors ( [PER Cuneyd Zapsu  ] , [PER Egemen Bagis  ] , [PER Omer Celik  ] , along with [PER Mucahit Arslan  ] and chef de cabinet [PER Hikmet Bulduk  ] ) are despised as inadequate , out of touch and corrupt by all our [ORG AKP  ] contacts from ministers to MPs and party intellectuals. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER Erdogan  ] 's pragmatism serves him well but he lacks vision . 
He and his principal [ORG AKP  ] advisors , as well as [PER FonMin Gul  ] and other ranking [ORG AKP  ] officials , also lack analytic depth . 
He relies on poor-quality intel and on media disinformation . 
With the narrow world-view and wariness that lingers from his [MISC Sunni  ] brotherhood and lodge background , he ducks his public relations responsibilities . 
He ( and those around him , including [PER FonMin Gul  ] ) indulge in pronounced pro-Sunni prejudices and in emotional reactions that prevent the development of coherent , practical domestic or foreign policies. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [PER Erdogan  ] has compounded his isolation by constantly traveling abroad -- reportedly 75 foreign trips in the past two years -- with a new series of trips planned for 2005 to [LOC Russia  ] , " [LOC Eurasia  ] " , the [LOC Middle East  ] and [LOC Africa  ] . 
Indeed , his staff says 2005 is the " year of [LOC Africa  ] " , but they provide no coherent reason why . 
This grueling cycle of travel has exhausted him and his staff and disrupted his ability to keep his hand on the tiller of party , parliamentary group , and government . 
He has alienated many in the [ORG AKP  ] parliamentary group by his habit of harshly chewing out MPs . 
Moreover , we understand that [LOC MUSIAD  ] , an [MISC Anatolia-wide  ] group of businessmen influential in [MISC Islamist  ] circles who gave [PER Erdogan  ] key financial support as [ORG AKP  ] campaigned prior to the 2002 elections , is disaffected by [PER Erdogan  ] 's unapproachability . 
Judging by comments to us of insiders in the influential [MISC Islamist  ] lodge of [PER Fethullah Gulen  ] such as publicist [PER Abdurrahman Celik  ] , the lodge , which has made some inroads into [ORG AKP  ] ( Minister of Justice Cicek , Minister of [ORG Culture and Tourism Mumcu  ] ; perhaps 60-80 of 368 MPs ; some appointments to the bureaucracy ) , has resumed the ambivalent attitude it initially had toward [PER Erdogan  ] and [ORG AKP.  ] <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) Second is the coalition nature of [ORG AKP  ] , the limited number of ministers whom [PER Erdogan  ] trusts , and the efforts of some -- principally [PER FonMin Gul  ] but from time to time Cicek -- to undermine [PER Erdogan  ] . 
No one else in [ORG AKP  ] comes close to [PER Erdogan  ] in grassroots popularity . 
However , [PER Gul  ] 's readiness to deprecate [PER Erdogan  ] within [ORG AKP  ] and even to foreign visitors ( e.g. , [MISC Israeli  ] deputy PM [PER Olmert  ] ) and his efforts to reduce [PER Erdogan  ] 's maneuvering room with hard-line criticisms of [LOC U.S.  ] policy in [LOC Iraq  ] or [ORG EU  ] policy on [LOC Cyprus  ] have forced [PER Erdogan  ] constantly to look over his shoulder and in turn to prove his credentials by making statements inimical to good [MISC U.S.-Turkish  ] relations . 
We expect [PER Erdogan  ] to carry out a partial cabinet reshuffle early in 2005 , but he will be unable to remove the influence of [LOC Gul.  ] <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( S ) Third is corruption . 
[ORG AKP  ] swept to power by promising to root out corruption . 
However , in increasing numbers AKPers from ministers on down , and people close to the party , are telling us of conflicts of interest or serious corruption in the party at the national , provincial and local level and among close family members of ministers . 
We have heard from two contacts that [PER Erdogan  ] has eight accounts in [MISC Swiss  ] banks ; his explanations that his wealth comes from the wedding presents guests gave his son and that a [MISC Turkish  ] businessman is paying the educational expenses of all four [PER Erdogan  ] children in the [LOC U.S.  ] purely altruistically are lame. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( S ) Among the many figures mentioned to us as prominently involved in corruption are Minister of Interior Aksu , Minister of Foreign Trade Tuzmen , and [ORG AKP Istanbul  ] provincial chairman [ORG Muezzinoglu  ] . 
As we understand it from a contact in the intel directorate of [MISC Turkish  ] [ORG National Police  ] , a continuing investigation into [ORG Muezzinoglu  ] 's extortion racket and other activities has already produced evidence incriminating [PER Erdogan  ] . 
In our contacts across Anatolia we have detected no willingness yet at the grassroots level to look closely at [PER Erdogan  ] or the party in this regard , but the trend is a time bomb. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( S ) Fourth is the poor quality of [PER Erdogan  ] 's and [ORG AKP  ] 's appointments to the [MISC Turkish  ] bureaucracy , at party headquarters , and as party mayoral candidates . 
A broad range of senior career civil servants , including [PER DefMin Gonul  ] , former Undersecretary of Customs [PER Nevzat Saygilioglu  ] , former [ORG Forestry DirGen  ] [PER Abdurrahman Sagkaya  ] , and many others , has expressed shock and dismay to us at the incompetence , prejudices and ignorance of appointees such as [PER Omer Dincer  ] , an [MISC Islamist  ] academic whom [PER Erdogan  ] appointed Undersecretary of the [ORG Prime Ministry  ] , THE key position in the government/state bureaucracy . 
[PER Dincer  ] is despised by the [ORG TGS  ] . 
Many interlocutors also point to the weakness of [PER Erdogan  ] 's deputy party chairmen . 
The result is that , unlike former leaders such as [PER Turgut Ozal  ] or [PER Suleyman Demirel  ] , both of whom appointed skilled figures who could speak authoritatively for their bosses as their party general secretary and as Undersecretary of the [ORG Prime Ministry  ] , [PER Erdogan  ] has left himself without people who can relieve him of the burden of day-to-day management or who can ensure effective , productive channels to the heart of the party and the heart of the [MISC Turkish  ] state . 
Two Big Questions ----------------- <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) [LOC Turkey  ] 's [ORG EU  ] bid has brought forth reams of pronouncements and articles -- [PER Mustafa Akyol  ] 's [MISC Gulenist-tinged  ] " Thanksgiving for [LOC Turkey  ] " in Dec. 27 [ORG Weekly Standard  ] is one of the latest -- attempting to portray [MISC Islam  ] in [LOC Turkey  ] as distinctively moderate and tolerant with a strong mystical ( [MISC Sufi  ] ) underpinning . 
Certainly , one can see in [LOC Turkey  ] 's theology faculties some attempts to wrestle with the problems of critical thinking , free will , and precedent ( ictihad ) , attempts which , compared to what goes on in theology faculties in the [MISC Arab  ] world , may appear relatively progressive. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( C ) However , the broad , rubber-meets-the-road reality is that [MISC Islam  ] in [LOC Turkey  ] is caught in a vise of ( 1 ) 100 years of " secular " pressure to hide itself from public view , ( 2 ) pressure and competition from brotherhoods and lodges to follow their narrow , occult " true way " , and ( 3 ) the faction- and positivism-ridden aridity of the [ORG Religious Affairs Directorate  ] ( [ORG Diyanet  ] ) . 
As a result , [MISC Islam  ] as it is lived in [LOC Turkey  ] is stultified , riddled with hypocrisy , ignorant and intolerant of other religions' presence in [LOC Turkey  ] , and unable to eject those who would politicize it in a radical , anti-Western way . 
Imams are for the most part poorly educated and all too ready to insinuate anti-Western , anti-Christian or anti-Jewish sentiments into their sermons . 
Exceptionally few [MISC Muslims  ] in [LOC Turkey  ] have the courage to challenge conventional [PER Sunni  ] thinking about jihad or , e.g. , verses in the Repentance shura of the [MISC Koran  ] which have for so long been used to justify violence against " infidels " . <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( C ) The problem is compounded by the willingness of politicians such as [PER Gul  ] to play elusively with politicized [MISC Islam  ] . 
Until [LOC Turkey  ] ensures that the humanist strain in [MISC Islam  ] prevails here , [MISC Islam  ] in [LOC Turkey  ] will remain a troubled , defensive force , hypocritical to an extreme degree and unwilling to adapt to the challenges of open society. <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( C ) A second question is the relation of [LOC Turkey  ] and its citizens to history -- the history of this land and citizens' individual history . 
Subject to rigid taboos , denial , fears , and mandatory gross distortions , the study of history and practice of historiography in the [LOC Republic  ] of [LOC Turkey  ] remind one of an old [MISC Soviet  ] academic joke: the faculty party chief assembles his party cadres and , warning against various ideological threats , proclaims , " The future is certain . 
It 's only that damned past that keeps changing . 
" <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( C ) Until [LOC Turkey  ] can reconcile itself to its past , including the troubling aspects of its [MISC Ottoman  ] past , in free and open debate , how will [LOC Turkey  ] reconcile itself to the concept and practice of reconciliation in the [ORG EU  ] ? 
How will it have the self confidence to take decisions and formulate policies responsive to [LOC U.S.  ] interests ? 
Some in [ORG AKP  ] are joining what is still only a handful of others to take tentative , but nonetheless inspiring , steps in this regard . 
However , the road ahead will require a massive overhaul of education , the introduction and acceptance of rule of law , and a fundamental redefinition of the relation between citizen and state . 
In the words of the great ( [MISC Alevi  ] ) Anatolian bard [PER Asik Veysel  ] , this is a " long and delicate road . 
" <a id='par29' href='#par29'>¶</a>29 . 
( U ) [LOC Baghdad  ] minimize considered .
