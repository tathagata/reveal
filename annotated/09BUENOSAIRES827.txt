THE KIRCHNERS' OPTIONS IN POST-ELECTION [ORG ARGENTINA Classified By: Charge d' Affaires  ] Tom [PER Kelly  ] for reasons 1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary/Introduction . 
More than two weeks have passed since [LOC Argentina  ] 's ruling first couple lost badly in mid-term congressional elections . 
It has taken President [PER Cristina Fernandez  ] de [PER Kirchner  ] ( [ORG CFK  ] ) and her husband [PER Nestor  ] time to process the meaning of the debacle and respond . 
Though the [ORG GOA  ] has taken some significant steps over the past two weeks , including a Cabinet shuffle , the signals that the Kirchners and their associates have sent have been decidedly mixed . 
It may be another month before their new strategy is fully discernible. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) In the past two weeks , Mission personnel have talked to dozens of political analysts , economists , businesspersons , and politicians about the [LOC Kirchners'  ] likely course . 
Most analyses posit three possible scenarios: radicalization , reform , or the status quo . 
While there are serious , smart people who believe that the government will lurch simply left or right over the coming months , we , and most of our contacts , believe that the government will behave in the future much as it has in the past . 
We think a tepid move toward reform is more likely than radicalization because the country 's ascendant forces support the former , not the latter . 
At the same time , we doubt that [MISC Kirchner-led  ] reform will be ambitious . 
The best that can be expected from this weakened government is a " reform-lite " agenda that seeks to recapture political space without significant policy concessions . 
This cable examines the three scenarios in depth ; identifies evidence in support of each one , as well as indicators to watch for that might clarify the [LOC Kirchners'  ] future intentions ; and evaluates the scenarios' likelihood . 
A separate message will critically examine another possible political outcome - that [ORG CFK  ] will fail to reach the end of her term . 
End [LOC Summary/Introduction.  ] --------------------------- The Radicalization Scenario --------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In the first ( and least likely ) scenario , the Kirchners react by turning hard left , attempting to reverse their fortunes through a radicalization of their regime that would propel them unambiguously into the [MISC Bolivarian  ] camp led by [PER Hugo Chavez  ] . 
This approach is referred to locally as " deepening the model . 
" Key elements of this approach would include: -- [MISC Economy: Further  ] nationalization of private companies and/or intensified attempts to manage their behavior ; a partial default on sovereign debt instruments ; and a confirmation of Internal Commerce Secretary [PER Guillermo Moreno  ] as the executor of [ORG NK  ] 's dirigiste economic policy ; increased influence by labor unions . 
-- [ORG Governance: Abandonment  ] of the [MISC Peronist  ] party in favor of " transversality , " in which the Kirchners consort with any and all who offer their fealty ; use of the government budget and other means to punish [MISC Peronist  ] governors and other politicians deemed disloyal ; pursuit of restrictive media legislation ; increased resort to executive decrees . 
-- Foreign Policy: Closer identification with [PER Hugo Chavez  ] and his [MISC Bolivarian  ] allies ; increasing criticism of [ORG USG  ] policies. ------------------------------- Evidence of a Shift to the Left ------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) There is a significant group of observers ( including political analyst [PER Rosendo Fraga  ] and [ORG Deutsche Bank Managing  ] Director [PER Marcelo Blanco  ] ) who subscribe to this school of thought . 
They do not lack evidence . 
Erstwhile [PER Kirchner  ] allies in the private sector , including [ORG Bank Association  ] chief [PER Jorge Brito  ] and [ORG Argentine Industrialist Association  ] head [PER Hector Mendez  ] , tell us that they are disgruntled with the Kirchners and lack influence on them . 
Their loss seems to be union boss [PER Hugo Moyano  ] 's gain . 
He flexed his muscles last week , compelling the [ORG GOA  ] to withdraw a subcabinet nomination in the [ORG Health Ministry  ] that threatened his unions' financial interests and installing the son of his attorney as head of [PER Aerolineas Argentinas  ] ( septel ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) On the political front , [PER Nestor Kirchner  ] resigned his position as head of the [ORG Peronist Party  ] the day after the June 28 election . 
Since then , rumors have proliferated of a new " transversal " approach that elevates [PER Kirchner  ] loyalists and hard-line ideologues like " piquetero " street activists and [ORG BUENOS  ] AIR 00000827 002 OF 005 the " [MISC Carta Abierta  ] " intellectual group . 
[PER Kirchner  ] showed up last week at an open-air meeting of " [MISC Carta Abierta  ] , " his first public appearance since his June 29 resignation as Peronist-in-chief . 
Last week 's cabinet shuffle only strengthened the hands of the loyalists , with no new blood and the replacement of the reform-oriented [PER Sergio Massa  ] with Kirchnerista [PER Anibal Fernandez  ] as Cabinet [ORG Chief.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Some of the [ORG GOA  ] 's post-election foreign policy moves can also be read to support the radicalization thesis . 
The most obvious was [ORG CFK  ] 's spur-of-the-moment trip to [LOC Central America  ] ( via the [ORG OAS  ] in [LOC Washington  ] ) in a hastily conceived effort to restore Manual [PER Zelaya  ] to power in [LOC Honduras  ] . 
Only [LOC Ecuador  ] 's [PER Rafael Correa  ] and [LOC Paraguay  ] 's [PER Fernando Lugo  ] accompanied [ORG CFK  ] and [ORG OAS  ] Secretary General [PER Insulza  ] on the ill-fated Mission . 
Wittingly or not , she seemed to side with hasty [MISC Bolivarian  ] efforts to force the issue in [LOC Honduras  ] rather than to wait for mediation to take its course . 
A more careful leader , [LOC Uruguay  ] 's [PER Tabare Vazquez  ] , let it be known that he declined [ORG CFK  ] 's invitation to join her aboard [MISC Tango One.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) There was one other foreign policy-related event that may suggest a leftward turn . 
[PER Kirchner  ] congressional ally [PER Patricia Vaca  ] Narvaja recently wrote a letter to [LOC U.S.  ] Speaker of the [ORG House  ] [PER Nancy Pelosi  ] asking for the [ORG USG  ] to declassify all information at its disposal regarding the [MISC Argentine  ] military dictatorship . 
The [PER Kirchner  ] government has often seemed obsessed with refighting the " [MISC Dirty War  ] " of the 1970s and early 80s , and the request could be construed as a prelude to another rhetorical offensive against the [ORG USG  ] for its " support " of military regimes in the region . 
( Alternatively , it could be a routine request consistent with the government 's longstanding interest in settling [MISC Dirty War-related  ] human rights cases . 
) -------------------------------- The [MISC Verdict:  ] " Red [PER Dawn  ] " Unlikely -------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Despite all of the above , we view the radicalization scenario as the least likely of the three paths that the government will take , with a probability of less than five percent . 
Even if the Kirchners prefer this approach in their heart of hearts , circumstances in the wake of the election give them virtually no margin to implement it . 
Immediately after the election , many of the most powerful forces within the governing coalition began clamoring for more moderate policies , a more inclusive approach to governance , and ( especially ) a larger share of government finances . 
These Peronist governors and mayors fared far better than [PER Nestor  ] did , and they are in no mood to take orders from the Kirchners . 
As a source close to [LOC Buenos Aires  ] Governor [PER Daniel Scioli  ] told the [ORG CDA  ] , " There are no captive politicians after these elections . 
" The private sector is similarly emboldened . 
As [ORG Industrialist Association  ] ( [ORG UIA  ] ) chief [PER Hector Mendez  ] told us that " deepening the model won't happen . 
We just won't allow it . 
" Finally , the anti-Kirchner opposition is clearly ascendant . 
These groups will fight [ORG GOA  ] efforts to march [LOC Argentina  ] further to the left . 
Given the current political climate , they should have the votes to hold the Kirchners at bay even before the new [ORG Congress  ] is seated in December. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Nor do we believe that [LOC Argentina  ] 's foreign policy is becoming more [MISC Bolivarian  ] . 
The [ORG GOA  ] has become much less eager to criticize the [ORG USG  ] directly since [PER Barack Obama  ] became President . 
[ORG CFK  ] wears her affection for our Commander-in-Chief on her sleeve . 
In addition , as mentioned in the next section ( para 16 ) , there is new evidence of concrete [ORG GOA  ] efforts to support [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy objectives in multilateral fora , at least behind the scenes. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) There is another external factor that makes [LOC Argentina  ] 's embrace of [MISC Bolivarian  ] politics unlikely -- the growing influence of [LOC Brazil  ] here . 
The local [ORG IDB  ] rep , [MISC Brazilian  ] [PER Daniel Oliveira  ] , told econoff recently that " [LOC Argentina  ] has become as important to [LOC Brazil  ] as [LOC Mexico  ] is to the [LOC United States  ] . 
" With a [MISC US$31  ] billion trade relationship and more than [MISC US$10  ] billion in [MISC Brazilian  ] investment flowing into the [LOC Argentina  ] economy since 1997 , [LOC Brazil  ] is strongly engaged here , and is not shy about defending its interests . 
The local press has reported that [PER Lula  ] worked the phones in July 2008 to prevent the Kirchners from abandoning power in the wake of their failed attempt to push a tax increase on agricultural exports through [ORG Congress  ] . 
[PER Lula  ] and his associates will remain an important moderating influence on the [LOC Kirchners.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S/NF ) Although we think this scenario 's likelihood is [ORG BUENOS  ] AIR 00000827 003 OF 005 limited , it bears mention that it is also the most likely to lead to political crisis , confrontation , escalating violence , and [ORG CFK  ] 's failure to reach the end of her term . 
We explore how such a downward spiral might play out , and the likelihood of this calamitous scenario , in a separate report. ------------------------------------------- [ORG Scenario Two:  ] The Kirchners Embrace Reform ------------------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Some observers expect ( and many more hope ) that the Kirchners will reinvent themselves , pursuing a reform-minded agenda that mollifies Peronist governors , defangs the opposition , and wins over new foreign friends . 
A larger group believes that a rebellious Peronist establishment will put them on that course , whether they like it or not . 
Key policy features of such an approach would include: -- [PER Economy: Interventionist-in-Chief Guillermo Moreno  ] is dismissed , clearing the way for a normalization of the state statistical institute [ORG INDEC  ] ( and thus a return to methodological integrity in the national accounts ) ; [ORG GOA  ] makes deals with the [ORG Paris Club  ] and private bondholders left out of the 2005 debt swap deal and normalizes its relationship with the [ORG IMF  ] , starting with an [ORG Article IV Consultation  ] ; progress on outstanding [ORG ICSID  ] judgments against [LOC Argentina  ] . 
-- Governance: [ORG CFK  ] rules more inclusively , coordinating policies with governors and looking for common ground with the opposition in the current and next [ORG Congress  ] . 
Government rolls back agricultural export taxes as a down-payment on its new conciliatory approach . 
NK reduces his public profile . 
-- Foreign Policy: Concrete steps benefiting the [LOC United States  ] and non-Bolivarian governments in the hemisphere , coupled with distancing from [PER Chavez  ] and his allies. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Proponents of this scenario 's likelihood have plenty of recent evidence to back them up . 
There is clearly ferment in the government 's approach to economic policy , with a new Economy Minister on board , powerful ( and heretofore pro-Venezuelan ) Planning Minister [PER Julio De Vido  ] now reputed to be an advocate of pragmatic moderation , and prestigious , market-oriented advisors ( specifically , former [ORG Central Banker  ] and [ORG IMF  ] official [PER Mario Blejer  ] ) said to be poised to join the government . 
The government sacked its statist , corrupt Transportation Secretary [PER Ricardo Jaime  ] days after the election , and rumors abound that [PER Moreno  ] , the icon of " market repression " economics , has become such a political liability that his days in the government are numbered . 
Well-placed sources within the government confirm that change is in the air . 
Top [ORG Kirchner  ] aide [PER Carlos Zannini  ] indicated that the [ORG GOA  ] would focus almost exclusively on changes on the economic policy front this month , and influential [LOC Buenos Aires  ] Province Vice-Governor [PER Alberto Balestrini  ] told the [ORG CDA  ] last week that the [ORG GOA  ] would roll back agricultural export taxes on wheat and corn soon. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Nor is there any doubt that the political center of gravity has shifted dramatically in [LOC Argentina  ] since the election . 
Most of the country 's 16 Peronist governors have reportedly expressed their desire for market-oriented changes , at least privately . 
Some former allies , like ambitious Chubut Governor [PER Mario Das Neves  ] , have broken ranks with the Kirchners and openly criticize them . 
Even loyalist governors like [ORG Chaco  ] 's [PER Jorge Capitanich  ] have publicly called for straightening out [ORG INDEC  ] and other changes . 
Faced with this onslaught from ostensible allies , [ORG CFK  ] announced on July 9 ( as she has before ) that she would convoke the country 's main political and private sector leaders to a process of dialogue . 
The following week , she modified the proposed process to accommodate opposition demands. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOA  ] 's political position is further weakened by the prospect that it will suffer defections from its ranks in the current [ORG Congress  ] . 
Of course , the next [ORG Congress  ] that takes office December 10 will be more independent , with the government losing majorities in both chambers . 
This will make it easier for reform-minded groups to push the Kirchners into accepting elements of their agendas . 
As [PER Balestrini  ] told us , the [ORG GOA  ] will need to renegotiate and compromise in order to rule. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOA  ] has taken a few subtle foreign policy moves that could be construed as harbingers of a closer relationship with the [LOC United States  ] . 
After he received a call on the issue from Secretary [PER Clinton  ] , FM [PER Jorge Taiana  ] convinced [ORG CFK  ] to change the voting instructions of the [MISC Argentine  ] delegation to the [ORG International Atomic Energy Agency  ] , which enabled [MISC U.S.-supported  ] candidate [PER Yukiya Amano  ] BUENOS AIR 00000827 004 OF 005 to win election after a month-long impasse . 
In a more prosaic but perhaps symbolically important development , the [ORG CDA  ] received a warm note from [ORG CFK  ] expressing regret for her failure to attend the [ORG Mission  ] 's [MISC Independence Day  ] celebration and offering best wishes . 
We had never before received such a note from either [LOC Kirchner.  ] ------------------------------------- The [ORG Verdict: Don't Bet On  ] A [ORG New Leaf  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) While the reform scenario has gained credence over the past week , driven primarily by economic policy news and rumors , we remain skeptical that [PER Nestor  ] and [PER Cristina  ] will turn into a latter-day incarnation of [PER Ozzie  ] and [PER Harriet  ] , dispensing moderation and good sense wherever they turn . 
Neither [ORG Kirchner  ] seems inclined to admit error , even tacitly , by shifting course so abruptly . 
A senior official at the [ORG Central Bank  ] told us that [PER Nestor  ] will resist reformist policies because they would be interpreted as a sign of his weakness and even irrelevance . 
If changes come , he argues , they will come at a time of his choosing . 
A reformist path may also strike the Kirchners as politically risky , distancing them from their most fervent supporters in the working class , poor " villas , " and intelligentsia in deference to sectors that are at best disloyal and at worst openly hostile to them. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) The " forced reform " variant of this scenario seems somewhat more likely , but not by much . 
For it to work , one of two things must happen . 
Either the [MISC Peronist  ] governors will need to set aside their rivalries and effectively advocate for a more robust approach to reform than seems likely , or the bickering , often inept opposition will need to get its act together and engage the Kirchners as a united front . 
Much depends , for example , on whether dissident [MISC Peronists  ] coalesce behind Senator [PER Carlos Reutemann  ] , who has emerged as a frontrunner for the [MISC Peronist  ] presidential nomination in 2011 , and whether Vice President [PER Julio Cobos  ] can gain some traction in pulling together support from the [MISC Radicals  ] , [ORG Civic Coalition  ] , and Socialists . 
If either of these two groups works cooperatively over the coming two months , it is possible that positive changes can come to [LOC Argentina  ] before [ORG CFK  ] leaves office in 2011 . 
We don't think that will happen , however , and estimate the two reform scenarios' combined probability at no more than twenty percent. --------------------------------- Scenario Three: Muddling Through --------------------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) In the third scenario , the Kirchners do not definitively opt for reform or radicalization . 
Maintaining the short-term focus that has characterized their six years in power , they muddle through as best they can , trying to salvage their political futures or at least to reach the end of [ORG CFK  ] 's term in 2011 . 
There may be some positive changes in this scenario -- one analyst dubs it " reform-lite " -- but the electoral setback does not ultimately result in a dramatic course correction . 
In the words of economist [PER Nicolas Dujovne  ] , the Kirchners will pursue a strategy of " minimum reforms , but without collapse . 
" Under this scenario , the following might happen: -- [ORG Economy: Lots  ] of policy zigzagging without a clear direction ; [PER Moreno  ] stays , or leaves and is replaced with another hard-liner ; new , " reform-minded " Economy Minister Boudou changes little , like the [ORG Cabinet  ] 's previous reformist also-rans [PER Martin Lousteau  ] and [PER Sergio Massa  ] . 
-- [ORG Governance: Cooption  ] of some [MISC Peronist  ] governors and mayors , punishment of others considered to be disloyal . 
Stalemate on legislation in [ORG Congress  ] . 
Top-down dialogue process initiated without intention to compromise . 
-- Foreign Policy: Some private gestures to the [ORG USG  ] , but little movement towards resolution of long-term sources of friction ; no palpable distancing from [PER Chavez  ] 's camp or modification of the [ORG GOA  ] 's " independent " foreign policy. --------------------------------------------- --------- For Evidence That Nothing Has Changed , Buy a Newspaper --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) This status-quo scenario is the clear frontrunner among our contacts . 
There is fresh evidence to support it in every day 's harvest of newspapers . 
The two dominant news stories since the election , [ORG CFK  ] 's botched trip to [LOC Honduras  ] and the [ORG GOA  ] 's response to the H1N1 epidemic here , both BUENOS AIR 00000827 005 OF 005 suggest that the government 's improvisational style and closed decision-making process remain intact . 
This in turn will mean that [ORG GOA  ] policies are more likely to develop in response to the first couple 's whims than to a coherent design . 
It also means that the government bureaucracy is unlikely to save the Kirchners from the consequences of their impulses . 
For example , [ORG CFK  ] went ahead with her ill-advised trip to [LOC Washington  ] and [ORG Central America  ] earlier this month against the advice of her Foreign Ministry . 
She ended up achieving no more than [PER Nestor  ] did in December 2007 when he participated in the [MISC Chavez-organized  ] " bungle in the jungle " in [LOC Colombia  ] , in which [PER Nestor  ] and others sat helplessly in the jungle for days in the futile hope that the [ORG FARC  ] would deliver hostages to them. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) The opacity of decision-making at the [ORG GOA  ] 's apex means that the government will continue to meander hither and yon , regardless of whether or not it has definitively chosen a particular direction . 
The [ORG GOA  ] 's performance in dealing with H1N1 flu is a case in point . 
Although many public health officials in the [ORG GOA  ] are working around the clock to contain the challenging problem , the government 's lack of internal communication made it look hapless . 
For example , upon alighting on [MISC Argentine  ] territory after her [ORG Central American  ] jaunt , [ORG CFK  ] denounced " fear-mongering " media reports of 100,000 flu cases in [LOC Argentina  ] -- information that had come from her own health ministry . 
( The 100,000 number referred to all flu cases , not just H1N1 flu . 
) The poor coordination continues . 
Over the past weekend , the Mission found itself in the middle of an unsightly ( non-public ) dispute between the federal [ORG Ministry of Health and its  ] counterpart in the Province of [LOC Buenos Aires  ] ( governed by [ORG Kirchner  ] ally [PER Daniel Scioli  ] ) over the destination of [MISC CDC-donated Tamiflu  ] doses , with each accusing the other of bad faith and subterfuge. --------------------------------------------- ------ The [ORG Verdict: More of the Same  ] , But [MISC Good Can Happen  ] --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( C ) Like most of our contacts , we think that this untidy scenario is the most likely outcome . 
We don't expect the Kirchners to change , but given the magnitude of their defeat in the mid-terms , we don't expect the [MISC Peronist  ] establishment or the opposition to back down , either . 
The Kirchners may even be able to prevail if their rivals and opponents fail to unite . 
Prolonged stalemate on most of the " big " policy issues seems the most likely outcome of a collision between a closed , reform-adverse , and politically weakened regime and disparate political groups that believe that they have a mandate for reform. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( C ) This does not mean , however , that no positive change in this scenario is possible . 
The Kirchners could take steps for ulterior motives that turn out to have beneficial consequences . 
This has already happened in the post mid-term era , when Transportation Secretary [PER Ricardo Jaime  ] departed office soon after the election . 
One of our contacts characterized the [MISC Kirchners'  ] willingness to cut the notoriously corrupt official loose as the beginning of a purge designed to distance them from the shadiest elements of their regime in an effort to reduce the likelihood that they themselves could end up in prison . 
Whatever the reason , [PER Jaime  ] 's removal could lead to policy improvements in the transportation sector. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( C ) Nor does it mean that the [ORG USG  ] should ignore the [ORG Kirchner  ] regime or give up on it as hopeless . 
[ORG CFK  ] may not have a grand scheme in mind for her remaining two years in power , but she clearly would like to associate herself with President [PER Obama  ] 's star power . 
The intensity of this desire opens all kinds of opportunities for us , as it did in [LOC Argentina  ] 's decisive [ORG IAEA  ] vote . 
As the Kirchners struggle for political relevance or at least survival , they will be looking for success stories -- and we should be on guard for opportunities to induce them to do the right thing . 
Even if the [ORG Kirchner  ] government is unlikely to resolve every single outstanding bilateral issue to our satisfaction , we think that cultivation of the [ORG GOA  ] -- [ORG CFK  ] in particular -- can lead to beneficial outcomes for [LOC U.S.  ] interests bilaterally , regionally , and multilaterally .
