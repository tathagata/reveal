( C/NF ) SUMMARY . 
Individuals formerly close to President [PER Karzai  ] attribute blame for [ORG Karzai’s  ] recent unpredictable behavior to the influence of a trio of [ORG Palace  ] advisors . 
Critics say [ORG Palace  ] Chief of Staff [PER Mohammad Daudzai  ] , Education Minister [PER Farooq Wardak  ] , and Information and Culture Minister [PER Abdul Karim Khoram  ] provide misleading advice and conspire to isolate [PER Karzai  ] from more pragmatic ( and pro-Western ) advisors in a purposeful effort to antagonize [MISC Western  ] countries , especially the [LOC United States  ] . 
These three share a common link to the mujahideen-era [ORG Hezb-e-Islami  ] organization , stoking suspicions , particularly among non-Pashtuns , that their efforts are part of a larger conspiracy . 
But in a rumor-driven country such as [LOC Afghanistan  ] , assumptions can far outstrip reality . 
There is a wide consensus that these three currently have [ORG Karzai’s  ] ear , but allowances have to be made for [MISC Afghan  ] rumor mongering and [ORG Karzai’s  ] own conspirational outlook . 
[ORG Karzai’s Advisor Bubble  ] ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) Many [PER Karzai  ] supporters , some who have been with the president since his transitional administration and 2004 presidential campaign , have expressed frustration over their lack of direct access to [PER Karzai  ] . 
They say Chief of Staff [PER Daudzai  ] has restricted access to the president and prevented other [ORG Palace  ] staff from meeting alone with [PER Karzai  ] . 
When petitioners do receive meetings , [PER Daudzai  ] is always present . 
MPs also complain [PER Karzai  ] is less accessible than he was two years ago , and repeatedly ignores their meeting requests . 
Many former allies have either withdrawn their support for his re-election or have held off on publicly committing to his campaign ( reftel ) . <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) [ORG Palace  ] Chief of Policy [PER Sebghatullah Sanjar  ] said [PER Daudzai  ] feeds the president misinformation and highlights negative coverage of his government , turning [PER Karzai  ] against former allies and influencing his opinions of people he has not yet met . 
[PER Sanjar  ] said [PER Daudzai  ] began to cut off [ORG Karzai’s  ] one-on-one meetings with other [ORG Palace  ] staff in 2008 , though [PER Sanjar  ] succeeded in seeing the president without [PER Daudzai  ] twice in the last two months . 
[PER Sanjar  ] and others say [PER Daudzai  ] is [ORG Karzai’s  ] most influential advisor on Afghanistan’s foreign policy and reconciliation initiatives . 
Many believe [PER Daudzai  ] is steering the president into closer ties with [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , and [MISC Taliban  ] leaders. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Sanjar  ] describes [PER Karzai  ] as a “lonely and alone man” who suspects his inner circle is leading him in the wrong direction , but does not know who else to trust . 
The president pays significant attention to the mostly negative media coverage of his government , perpetuating his suspicions that enemies are “out to get him.” [PER Daudzai  ] and [PER Khoram  ] have convinced [PER Karzai  ] to take a harder line against his critics , regardless of whether they are traditional rivals or allies providing constructive criticism . 
[PER Sanjar  ] suggests this advice is a factor in [MISC Karzai’s  ] emotional reactions to civilian casualty incidents and his publicized dialogue with [LOC Russia  ] . 
Former Foreign Minister [PER Abdullah Abdullah  ] claimed [PER Daudzai  ] and [PER Farooq Wardak  ] know how to manipulate [ORG Karzai’s  ] thought process and tendency to make emotional decisions based on unvetted information . 
[PER Abdullah  ] also asserts that [PER Karzai  ] is increasingly paranoid , and prone to a conspirational outlook on life , leading him to blame all problems on others and unable to see his own role in mistakes. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) FM [MISC Spanta  ] objects to [MISC Daudzai’s  ] conduct on limiting access , including for [MISC Spanta  ] , and to [MISC Daudzai’s  ] policy influence . 
They have a cool relationship . 
[ORG Palace  ] Deputy Chief of Staff [PER Homayra Etemadi  ] affirms the observations of others on [MISC Daudzai’s  ] ill influence over [PER Karzai  ] . 
She distrusts her boss , and has recommended the Embassy consider carefully what kinds of information it shares with [PER Daudzai  ] . 
MFA Chief of Protocol [PER Hamid Sidiq  ] is convinced that [PER Daudzai  ] , who once served as Afghanistan’s ambassador to [LOC Tehran  ] , is working to advance Tehran’s interests ahead of the [ORG United States’  ] vis-a-vis the [ORG Palace  ] . 
[PER Sidiq  ] reported that [PER Daudzai  ] recently overruled an MFA decision to turn down a meeting request to [PER Karzai  ] by an 8-person delegation of [MISC Iranian  ] television officials . 
Earlier that day the [ORG Palace  ] had limited an official [MISC Canadian  ] delegation to five members to see [PER Karzai.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) Information Minister [PER Khoram  ] and Education Minister [PER Wardak  ] get their fair share of criticism as well . 
Social moderates like [ORG Lower House MP  ] [PER Shukria Barakzai  ] ( [LOC Kabul  ] , [PER Pashtun  ] ) , [ORG Upper House MP  ] [PER Rida Azimi  ] ( [ORG Parwan  ] , [MISC Tajik  ] ) , and former [PER Wardak Governor  ] [PER Abdul Jabbar Naeemi  ] blame [PER Khoram  ] for [MISC Karzai’s  ] increasingly conservative stands on social issues [LOC KABUL  ] 00000467 002 OF 002 and [PER Wardak  ] for the president’s hesitance to publicly criticize the [MISC Taliban  ] and other insurgent groups . 
[ORG United Front  ] members and other contacts are incensed that [PER Karzai  ] criticizes the [LOC United States  ] and other [ORG Coalition  ] partners after civilian casualty incidents , but only issues muted statements through his press office or the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] after deadly insurgent attacks , such as the Feb. 11 attacks on government ministries in [LOC Kabul  ] . 
The [ORG Hezb-e-Islami Connection  ] ---------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Daudzai  ] , [PER Khoram  ] , and [PER Wardak  ] were members of [ORG Hezb-e-Islami  ] ( [ORG HI  ] ) in the 1980s , during the mujahideen campaign against [MISC Soviet  ] forces . 
The majority-Pashtun HI’s later rivalry with the [MISC Tajik-centric  ] [PER Jamiat-e-Milli  ] and other resistance groups has left a legacy of ethnic-based tension among mujahideen today . 
None of the three advisors is a member of [ORG Hezb-e-Islami Afghanistan  ] , the political party that broke with [PER Gulbuddin Hekmatyar  ] in order to re-join [MISC Afghan  ] politics . 
However , many [MISC Tajiks  ] and other non-Pashtuns maintain their suspicions that every promotion or appointment of a former [ORG HI  ] member or current [ORG HIA  ] member is part of a conspiracy of “Pashtunization” of the government driven by [PER Daudzai  ] , [PER Wardak  ] , and [ORG Khoram.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) [ORG HIA  ] Chairman Arghandewal suspects [PER Daudzai  ] manipulates [ORG Karzai’s  ] political views , but denies any connection between his party and the three advisors . 
Arghandewal , who serves as a tribal advisor to the [PER Karzai  ] , has not had a one-on-one conversation with the president in more than nine months , rendering him an “advisor who does not give advice.” He said [ORG HIA  ] members are frustrated by the public’s association of them with the [MISC Daudzai-Wardak-Khoram  ] bloc , since the three have no current ties to the party and were only minor figures in the mujahideen years . 
Arghandewal , Hekmatyar’s chief financial officer for several years , said he may have met [PER Daudzai  ] or [PER Khoram  ] in passing during the 1980s , but only became aware of their [ORG HI  ] connections after their current rise to prominence . 
Conspiracy or Projection ? ---------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) In [LOC Afghanistan  ] , all criticism and personal attacks should be taken with a grain of salt and examined carefully for underlying and ulterior motives . 
That said , the criticism of [MISC Karzai’s  ] inner circle spans the ideological spectrum and includes detractors from all major ethnic groups . 
By all accounts , [MISC Karzai’s  ] access to one-time loyalists has been more limited over the past year . 
But those who feel loyalty to or pity for the embattled president may be projecting their frustrations away from [PER Karzai  ] and on to the nearest target , his advisors . 
Others , mostly ethnic northerners inclined to distrust any [LOC Pashtun  ] leader’s motives , see the [ORG Hezb-e-Islami  ] connections of [PER Daudzai  ] , [PER Wardak  ] , and [PER Khoram  ] as all the proof they need to substantiate their conspiracy theories . 
But [ORG Hezb-e-Islami  ] members tend to be among the most educated [MISC Afghan  ] mujahideen , and thus the fact that they may be in positions of technocratic power today - close to [PER Karzai  ] or not - is understandable in a government with a thin pool of competency to draw from. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C/NF ) For the impartial observer , it is difficult to determine whether these three advisors do indeed have their own agenda or whether [MISC Karzai’s  ] reliance on their counsel is a reflection of his own political leanings . 
What is clear , however , is that the characterizations of [MISC Karzai’s  ] emotional and psychological state by his [MISC Afghan  ] critics reported here are by and large consistent with our own observations and dealings with him .
