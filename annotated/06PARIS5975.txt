) An Unforgettable Scene ---------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) As the Ambassador was about to leave , [PER Sarkozy  ] went to the line of floor-to-ceiling windows that open from the interior minister’s office to the gardens of the interior ministry , and called over his nine-year old son , [PER Louis  ] , who was playing on the lawn ( [PER Sarkozy  ] lives with his family in apartments above his office ) . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] was clearly happy -- and proud -- to be in the company of his young son and seemed tickled to be able to introduce him to “the Ambassador of the [LOC United States.”  ] [PER Louis  ] appeared at the threshold with a small dog at his feet and a large rabbit in his arms . 
To shake hands with the Ambassador , [PER Louis  ] put down the rabbit -- and the dog started chasing the rabbit through [MISC Sarkozy’s  ] office , which led to the unforgettable sight of [PER Sarkozy  ] , bent over , chasing the dog through the ante-room to his office as the dog chased the rabbit , and [PER Louis  ] filled the room with gleeful laughter .
