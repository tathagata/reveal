Reason 1.4a and b <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: There is positive movement in [LOC Brazil  ] 's position regarding the proposed non-proliferation initiative at the [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group  ] concerning transfers of enrichment and reprocessing equipment and technology , according to the [ORG Ministry of Exterior Relations'  ] Director of the [ORG Division for Disarmament and Sensitive Technology Santiago  ] [PER Mourao  ] . 
He thought that acceptable language could be reached on [ORG Paragraph  ] 6 of the proposal , which included a requirement of an Additional Protocol for an ENR transfer , so long as an exception for [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] were included . 
He also noted that others were concerned about the use of a " black box " approach for transfers of installations in [ORG Paragraph  ] 7 , but - even though [LOC Brazil  ] would prefer something else - this would be acceptable . 
[ORG Paragraph  ] 7 is " not [LOC Brazil  ] 's fight , " he stated . 
END SUMMARY . 
COMPROMISE POSSIBLE ON [ORG PARAGRAPH  ] 6 AND ENR TRANSFERS <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Ministry of Exterior Relations'  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) Director of the [ORG Division for Disarmament and Sensitive Technology  ] ( [ORG DDT  ] ) [ORG Santiago  ] [PER Mourao  ] outlined the movement in [LOC Brazil  ] 's thinking about the proposal for a criteria-based approach to strengthening controls over transfers of enrichment and reprocessing ( ENR ) equipment and technology being considered by the [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group  ] ( [ORG NSG  ] ) . 
At a meeting on June 2 with [ORG Environment , Science & Technology  ] , and Health ( ESTH ) Counselor and ESTH Officer he said that he sees more flexibility with his government 's position . 
He commented that now he sees a willingness to reach a compromise from the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] , as well as unspecified others , which have been wary of the proposed language in [ORG Paragraph  ] 6 of the proposal including a criterion about an Additional Protocol for ENR transfers. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Mourao  ] said for [LOC Brazil  ] an acceptable compromise would be an agreement on [ORG Paragraph  ] 6 that had simple language , requiring an Additional Protocol and then creating a clear exception for [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] . 
He added that something along the lines of the [LOC Netherlands  ] proposal would be acceptable . 
QUESTIONS ABOUT [ORG PARAGRAPH  ] 7 , BUT " NOT BRAZIL'S FIGHT " <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Just as a solution seems in reach for [ORG Paragraph  ] 6 and ENR transfers , [PER Mourao  ] commented that he was seeing concerns raised by others about [ORG Paragraph  ] 7 and transfers of installations by means of a " black box " process . 
He noted that with all the focus on [ORG Paragraph  ] 6 , the [ORG NSG  ] members had not given that much attention to [ORG Paragraph  ] 7 . 
He opined that while he would have preferred to have something other than the " black box " approach , in the end [LOC Brazil  ] could live with it , provided that [ORG Paragraph  ] 6 is acceptable . 
For [LOC Brazil  ] , he added that it was essential that the [ORG NSG  ] abide by the decision taken in [LOC Oslo  ] to consider [ORG Paragraphs  ] 6 and 7 jointly , as a package. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In the end , [PER Mourao  ] concluded that [ORG Paragraph  ] 7 was " not [LOC Brazil  ] 's fight " . 
[LOC Brazil  ] didn't expect to be involved in transfers of installations . 
Thus , they could live with the language of [ORG Paragraph  ] 7 as long as the Additional Protocol language in [ORG Paragraph  ] 6 was acceptable. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) COMMENT . 
[PER Mourao  ] was the most optimistic the ESTH Counselor has seen about reaching a solution within the [MISC Brazilian  ] government . 
It appears that [LOC Brazil  ] can accept language in an international agreement requiring the use of an Additional Protocol , at least for ENR transfers , so long as [LOC Brazil  ] 's - and [LOC Argentina  ] 's - particular concerns are addressed . 
This represents a positive development in [LOC Brazil  ] 's approach to non-proliferation measures . 
[PER Mourao  ] also seemed upbeat about the [ORG NSG  ] reaching agreement on the proposal . 
END COMMENT .
