[PER Carol van Voorst  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C/NF ) Summary: [LOC Iceland  ] 's bid for one of two available [ORG WEOG  ] seats on the [ORG UN Security Council  ] in 2009-10 is rapidly drawing to a close . 
The campaign , hamstrung by a slow start and tepid support at home , has found its legs over the last year under the enthusiastic direction of Foreign Minister [PER Gisladottir  ] . 
[LOC Iceland  ] has campaigned on a strategy of " every vote counts , " but in recent months has taken particular aim at competitor [LOC Austria  ] . 
As a [ORG Security Council  ] member , [LOC Iceland  ] would be generally supportive of [LOC U.S.  ] priorities , though particular engagement would be necessary on questions of armed intervention . 
The small size of [LOC Iceland  ] 's foreign service and lack of depth on many issues would force [LOC Iceland  ] to look often to its friends and neighbors for advice . 
Lobbying in other [MISC Nordic  ] capitals will be of key importance should [LOC Iceland  ] win a [ORG UNSC  ] seat . 
End Summary . 
Getting a slow start at home and abroad --------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [LOC Iceland  ] is one of three candidates for two [ORG Western European  ] and [ORG Other Group  ] ( [ORG WEOG  ] ) seats on the [ORG UN Security Council  ] in 2009-10 , running against [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Austria  ] . 
[LOC Iceland  ] 's bid for a [ORG Security Council  ] seat did not begin to properly get organized until late 2006 under then-Foreign Minister [PER Valgerdur Sverrisdottir  ] . 
Previous FMs -- particularly [PER David Oddsson  ] from 2004-2005 -- did little to win support at home or get organized overseas for the effort . 
Should [LOC Iceland  ] fail to win a seat , many supporters of the bid will point the finger at [PER Oddsson  ] and the [ORG Independence Party  ] as a whole. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Reflecting the ambivalence inside the government , the [MISC Icelandic  ] public has also split on the issue . 
The campaign 's cost ( roughly $3.33 million from 2001 to 2007 , with an additional $800,000 budgeted through October 2008 ) is an easy target for those who think [LOC Iceland  ] should have a less activist foreign policy as well as critics of government spending , particularly on the left end of the spectrum . 
However , even some close to the Prime Minister 's [ORG Independence Party  ] and in favor of a robust foreign policy have told [PER PolOff  ] that they are dubious that [LOC Iceland  ] can effectively carry out the responsibilities of a [ORG UNSC  ] member . 
Under current FM [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] , who has made winning a [ORG UNSC  ] seat a priority , polls show support for [LOC Iceland  ] 's candidacy is only 46 percent , with 36 percent against . 
Every vote counts...but especially if we take them from [LOC Austria  ] ------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Valgerdur Sverrisdottir  ] made the campaign more of a priority than her predecessors during her 2006-2007 tenure as Foreign Minister , but it still gained little traction . 
Foreign Minister [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] took several bold moves immediately after her arrival in May 2007 at the ministry . 
Pledging to make the [ORG UNSC  ] campaign simultaneously cheaper and more effective , [PER Gisladottir  ] appointed a special envoy to head the effort and allowed her to assemble a dedicated team . 
FM [PER Gisladottir  ] also began a series of high-visibility trips to regions outside of the usual [MISC Nordics-U.S.-Europe  ] circuit: since May 2007 , she has gone to the [LOC Middle East  ] five times , and [LOC Africa  ] three times , as well as making visits to the [LOC Caribbean  ] and [LOC Afghanistan.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) Senior [ORG MFA  ] officials as well as working-level officers in the [ORG UNSC  ] campaign office have told post that in addition to the FM 's travel , the ministry as a whole is racking up frequent-flyer miles . 
Rather than targeting strategic countries to influence a whole regional bloc , the [MISC Icelandic  ] approach has been one of stumping for each and every vote -- a huge strain on a foreign service of only 205 people worldwide . 
In a July 2 meeting with Ambassador , Permanent Secretary [PER Gretar Mar Sigurdsson  ] allowed that the campaign " has been bloody hard for us , " as he described having to spend the better part of a week on a [LOC Pacific  ] islands trip to counter [LOC Micronesia  ] 's declaration of support for [LOC Austria.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC C/NF  ] ) [LOC Austria  ] is [LOC Iceland  ] 's main target in the campaign . 
Though Ministry officials declined to confirm this directly , the tone and content of [ORG MFA  ] pitches to Ambassador and visiting [ORG USG  ] officials indicate that they believe [LOC Turkey  ] is a sure winner , but [LOC Austria  ] 's dubious economic and energy ties to [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Russia  ] may create an opening for [LOC Iceland  ] . 
[LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear efforts are likely to be the most significant challenge to the [ORG UNSC  ] in 2009-2010 , [ORG MFA PermSec Sigurdsson  ] has argued to Ambassador and visiting [LOC U.S.  ] officials , and [LOC Iceland  ] has neither the problematic history of dealings with [LOC Iran  ] nor the economic exposure that [LOC Austria  ] does . 
Beyond substantive concerns , [MISC Icelandic  ] officials have also accused [LOC Austria  ] of unfairly leveraging [LOC Vienna  ] 's role as host to multiple [ORG UN  ] agencies , and were incensed by [ORG UN  ] Secretary General [PER Ban Ki-Moon  ] 's comments in May 2008 apparently supporting [LOC Austria  ] 's bid -- in their eyes , another sign of shady campaigning by [LOC Austria.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) The " every vote counts " perspective has also influenced [MISC Icelandic  ] performance on other foreign policy issues over the last year . 
Increased ties to the [LOC Middle East  ] have translated into contacts with both [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Iran  ] . 
Similarly , [LOC Iceland  ] has appeared reluctant to annoy [LOC Russia  ] on recognition of [LOC Kosovo  ] and the conflict with [LOC Georgia  ] . 
Though in both cases [LOC Iceland  ] eventually lined up with [ORG USG  ] views -- recognizing [LOC Kosovo  ] within a couple of weeks of independence and eventually calling in the [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador here regarding events in [LOC Georgia  ] -- there were some questions as to whether the [ORG UNSC  ] bid made the [ORG MFA  ] more gun-shy than it might otherwise have been . 
What would [ORG UNSC  ] member [LOC Iceland  ] do ? ---------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) [LOC Iceland  ] has made a principled case for a [ORG UNSC  ] seat based on its impeccable democratic credentials , support for the [ORG UN  ] system , and the idea that all [ORG UN  ] member states should have the chance to sit on the [ORG Security Council  ] . 
What it has not done is present a concrete picture of what kind of [ORG Security Council  ] member ( and chair ) it would be . 
Post 's analysis is that [LOC Iceland  ] would be generally in agreement with [ORG USG  ] priorities . 
Some disagreements do exist , and the FM 's discomfort with the use of military force would require strong engagement on questions of intervention . 
[LOC Iceland  ] 's initiatives would closely mirror the interests of FM Gisladottir: [LOC Iceland  ] would work for progress on the empowerment and security of women , the broader concept of human security , and possibly even environmental security concerns. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) In approaches to [ORG USG  ] officials , [LOC Iceland  ] has consistently appealed to the history of our bilateral relationship and our common membership in [ORG NATO  ] . 
Post believes that our close defense ties and the [LOC U.S.  ] treaty obligations as [LOC Iceland  ] 's first defender in war -- notwithstanding the withdrawal of [LOC U.S.  ] military forces from [LOC Iceland  ] in September 2006 -- and [LOC Iceland  ] 's voting record at the [ORG UN  ] would translate into a commonality of views on most issues . 
We have consistently been on the same side of human rights issues in the [ORG UNGA Third Committee  ] and the [ORG UN Human Rights Council  ] , and [LOC Iceland  ] has been a staunch supporter of [LOC U.S.  ] efforts on UNSCR 1820 on the security of women in conflic and the [ORG UNGA  ] declaration on Prisoners of Conscince. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C/NF ) Areas of disagreement do exist which may be exacerbated by [LOC Iceland  ] 's lack of amilitary and the Foreign Minister 's personal discmfort with the use of force . 
[LOC Iceland  ] shares a broad [MISC European  ] skepticism on [ORG USG  ] policy towards [LOC Cuba  ] , and has not voted our way on the [LOC Cuba  ] embargo resolution . 
Similarly , [LOC Iceland  ] has followed the [MISC Nordic  ] line on anti-Israel resolutions in recent years . 
On [LOC Iraq  ] , the previous [MISC Icelandic  ] government pledged its political support to the invasion of [LOC Iraq  ] in 2003 and later sent personnel in support of explosive ordnance disposal and the [ORG NATO  ] Training Mission-Iraq . 
However , FM [PER Gisladottir  ] campaigned in the 2007 elections on a pledge of " removing [LOC Iceland  ] 's name " from the [ORG Coalition of the Willing  ] and called back the lone [MISC Icelander  ] at [LOC NTM-I  ] . 
Beyond simple opposition to the [LOC Iraq  ] war , FM [PER Gisladottir  ] 's views are colored by the fact that [LOC Iceland  ] has no military , which she thinks gives [LOC Iceland  ] a unique moral role , as an honest broker and example , in world affairs . 
This does not translate into a complete opposition to armed intervention -- under [PER Gisladottir  ] , the [ORG MFA  ] has maintained financial and logistical support for [ORG NATO  ] operations in [LOC Afghanistan  ] -- but it means that [LOC Iceland  ] will need to be fully convinced that diplomatic efforts have run their course. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C/NF ) A final complication is the tiny size of [LOC Iceland  ] 's foreign service , which greatly limits both the information at hand as well as the ability to process that information . 
The [ORG International Organizations Department Head  ] noted wryly to PolOff that until now , [LOC Iceland  ] had the luxury of deciding which issues to follow , but that this will come to a swift end in October should [LOC Iceland  ] be voted in . 
The [ORG MFA 's Security Council  ] campaign office has carefully examined the [ORG UNSC  ] experience of [LOC Costa Rica  ] , another comparatively small state without an army . 
Much of the expense of the [ORG UNSC  ] campaign stems from the expansion of the permanent mission in [LOC New York  ] ; current plans are to double the size of the mission to 20 diplomats should [LOC Iceland  ] win election . 
Given that this is nearly 10 percent of [LOC Iceland  ] 's total diplomatic corps , the entire personnel transfer season for this year is on hold pending the vote results. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C/NF ) In practical terms , this means the Icelanders will look more than usual to their [MISC Nordic  ] colleagues for background and advice on key issues . 
A division of labor across issues already exists , according to [ORG MFA  ] contacts and the [MISC Norwegian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Reykjavik  ] , and the [MISC Norwegians  ] are expecting to be asked for quite a bit more help . 
This stems both from the traditionally close relationship between the two countries as well as the warm ties between FMs [PER Gisladottir  ] and [ORG Stoere  ] . 
Though [LOC Iceland  ] has formally abandoned a previous proposal to dual-accredit other [MISC Nordic  ] diplomats at the [ORG UN  ] , [MISC Nordic  ] ties and collaboration in [LOC New York  ] and capitals will be very close if [LOC Iceland  ] wins its bid . 
For the [ORG USG  ] , this will mean that engagement in other [MISC Nordic  ] capitals will take on new significance in influencing [LOC Iceland  ] 's position. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C/NF ) [MISC Comment: Despite  ] some policy differences and the challenges of working with such a short-staffed diplomatic corps , Post is confident that [LOC Iceland  ] would work closely and productively with us on the [ORG Security Council  ] . 
[LOC Iceland  ] is a member of [ORG NATO  ] with impeccable diplomatic credentials , and its default worldview is generally in line with [LOC U.S.  ] values and priorities .
