( [LOC C  ] ) The Ambassador met with [MISC Brazilian  ] presidential Foreign Policy Advisor [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] on June 25 to express our concern regarding the [MISC Bolivian  ] government 's lack of concrete assurances to protect our embassy in [LOC La Paz  ] . 
[PER Garcia  ] promised to raise the issue with the [MISC Bolivian  ] ambassador ( which he did immediately after meeting with the Ambassador ) and with higher levels in the [MISC Bolivian  ] government . 
He also said he would bring the request to President [PER Lula  ] 's attention . 
[PER Garcia  ] said that , in his view , [LOC Bolivia  ] is at a dangerous time and is in for a lengthy period of increased instability . 
He encouraged the [ORG USG  ] to offer the [MISC Bolivian  ] government gestures that clearly signal we are fully neutral between the [MISC Bolivian  ] government and opposition . 
[PER Garcia  ] also told the Ambassador that President [PER Lula  ] 's trip to [LOC Venezuela  ] was focused on commercial cooperation , that he did not see [PER Raul Castro  ] making any additional changes in response to the [ORG EU  ] lifting of sanctions , and that President [PER Bush  ] and President [PER Lula  ] should take up cooperation on biofuels at their meeting during the [LOC G-8  ] in [LOC Japan  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The Ambassador , accompanied by [MISC PolCouns  ] ( notetaker ) met with [ORG Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] on June 25 to deliver points ref a . 
[PER Garcia  ] was accompanied by advisors Ambassador [PER Marcel Biato  ] and [PER Elio de Almeida Cardoso  ] . 
After conveying condolences on the death of former first lady [PER Ruth Cardoso  ] , the Ambassador explained to [PER Garcia  ] our concerns with regard to the security of our embassy in [LOC Bolivia  ] and requested [LOC Brazil  ] 's assistance . 
( Note: The day before , [ORG Ministry of Foreign Relations Under Secretary for South America Enio  ] [PER Cordeiro  ] had called to follow-up his conversation with the Ambassador , ref b . 
[PER Cordeiro  ] said he had spoken with the [MISC Colombian  ] vice minister of foreign affairs regarding the security of the [LOC U.S.  ] embassy , and they had agreed that the best approach to the [MISC Bolivian  ] government would be through the [PER Papal Nuncio  ] . 
End note . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The Ambassador asked for [PER Garcia  ] 's assessment of the situation . 
[PER Garcia  ] said that the current problems stem in part from President [PER Morales  ] having come to office acting " as if it were a revolution . 
" His polemics have been a factor in instability , [PER Garcia  ] said , but the instability already existed , noting he had visited [LOC Bolivia  ] twelve times during President [PER Lula  ] 's first term , and had met with four presidents . 
[LOC Bolivia  ] 's institutional problems remain , and there has been no effort on either side to follow established procedures . 
The opposition is controlled by a " hard " element , on the one hand . 
On the other , the government has refused to differentiate between opposition hard-liners and " modern rightists " like [PER Tuto Quiroga  ] . 
So instead of resolving issues , [PER Garcia  ] said , each side has hardened their position , and they are beyond hearing each other. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) As a result , a new stalemate has developed . 
This will continue , [PER Garcia  ] predicted , even after the August 10 referendum--if the referendum happens at all . 
He explained that the questioning of the referendum 's legitimacy by the opposition provinces called into question whether it would even take place . 
[PER Garcia  ] said it is his personal opinion that [LOC Bolivia  ] faces enormous dangers now . 
The intention of the opposition , he believes , is to make the central government irrelevant , to " make it bleed , " so it will be brought down by " non-institutional means . 
" He said the government might in fact fall , but only " within the established timeframes . 
" Opposition efforts to force it out of power would not work . 
In any case , [PER Garcia  ] believes a long period of instability is going to ensue that , like a flammable gas in the air , could be set off by even a small spark . 
The fact is that [LOC Bolivia  ] is going through major social and political change , which is hard to control . 
[LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000880 002 OF 003 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia  ] said that many [MISC Brazilians  ] were surprised by [ORG Morales'  ] confrontational posture toward [LOC Brazil  ] early on , and it had required a great deal of patience to put the relationship back on track and establish a frank dialogue . 
[LOC Brazil  ] has told the [MISC Bolivian  ] government that it needs to tone down the rhetoric and resolve its disputes if it wants to make progress toward what [PER Morales  ] wants to achieve . 
The government has a reasonable macroeconomic situation , he said , but needs to make sure that the current economic growth is more than just a bubble . 
As a result , its ability to attract investment--and particularly to maximize its energy potential--is crucial . 
In the latter case , in particular , it will run into problems not only in filling contracts with [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] , but also in supplying its growing domestic needs. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) The Ambassador said that [LOC Bolivia  ] needs to understand that companies , including [MISC Brazilian  ] companies , will not invest when they see our embassy under attack . 
[PER Garcia  ] acknowledged the point , saying that he had pushed [ORG Petrobras  ] to go back into [LOC Bolivia  ] in part as a sign to other investors . 
The Ambassador asked if [PER Garcia  ] thought that the breakdown of stability and security in [LOC Bolivia  ] would hurt foreign companies there . 
He responded that many companies have a solid commitment and long-term perspective . 
Heavyweight investors know that the conflict " won't go beyond a certain point , " and whichever side wins out , [LOC Bolivia  ] will need investment . 
[ORG Petrobras  ] has not lost any money there , he concluded. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia  ] said he would deliver the message to the [MISC Bolivians  ] , noting that he would be meeting with the [MISC Bolivian  ] ambassador following the meeting with Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] . 
[PER Garcia  ] suggested that , " Maybe it is time ( for the [LOC United States  ] ) to have a frank discussion with [LOC Bolivia  ] , " adding that " [PER Tom  ] ( [PER Shannon  ] ) is well-respected in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
" He cannot see how conflict with the [LOC United States  ] is beneficial to [LOC Bolivia  ] , he said . 
The Ambassador suggested that it might serve as a distraction for the [MISC Bolivian  ] government 's domestic problems . 
[PER Garcia  ] took the point , but said that in the long run , they would gain in some ways but lose in others. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) " We bet on dialogue , " [PER Garcia  ] stressed , suggesting that a " mutual non-aggression pact " was in order . 
The Ambassador responded that public support for the security of our embassy would undoubtedly open other channels for dialogue , but stressed that security of our embassy cannot be open for discussion . 
[PER Garcia  ] agreed . 
But he cautioned that we should " not underestimate anti-Americanism in some circles . 
" ( " There 's an old joke we used to tell , " he said: " Why hasn't there ever been a coup in the [LOC United States  ] ? 
Because they don't have an [MISC American  ] embassy . 
" ) He said that the [LOC United States  ] needs to offer a sign that we are not on anyone 's side , something that would increase [MISC American  ] credibility vis-a-vis the [MISC Bolivian  ] government . 
Without wishing to be a mediator , he said , [LOC Brazil  ] is willing to help in whatever it can , recalling a similar commitment he made to [PER A/S Shannon  ] two years earlier . 
He suggested that [LOC Brazil  ] had a hand in encouraging [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] to lower his tone and become " less present " today on the issue . 
[PER Chavez  ] understood that his efforts were too invasive and ultimately counterproductive. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Coming back to the request , [PER Garcia  ] said the [MISC Bolivian  ] ambassador in [LOC Brasilia  ] was " very professional " and he would sound him out . 
He also committed to raising the request with President [PER Lula  ] , adding he knew that [PER A/S Shannon  ] had raised the issue with [MISC Brazilian  ] Ambassador [PER Patriota  ] in [LOC Washington  ] . 
( Note: In a readout on June 26 , Amb . 
[PER Biato  ] said that [PER Garcia  ] had had a long meeting with the [MISC Bolivian  ] ambassador and had made clear that it was important for the [MISC Bolivian  ] government to cease provoking the [LOC United States  ] and to make amends . 
[PER Garcia  ] had stressed that conflict could not be helpful to the [MISC Bolivians  ] . 
[PER Biato  ] reiterated that [PER Garcia  ] intended to raise the issue with President [PER Lula  ] and with " higher levels " in [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000880 003 OF 003 [LOC Bolivia  ] .

) <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked about President [PER Lula  ] 's priorities for his June 27 meeting with President [PER Chavez  ] . 
[PER Garcia  ] said that [PER Chavez  ] is seeking an import substitution model for [MISC Venezuelan  ] agriculture and development , and the two presidents will discuss ten projects that are still being developed in the areas of steel production , integrated circuits , television , and plastics , among others . 
In agriculture , the [MISC Venezuelans  ] are looking to work with [LOC Brazil  ] to develop either family farms or large-scale ( i.e. , 80,000 ha . 
) soy farms . 
They are also interested in dairy and poultry . 
The ultimate goal for [PER Chavez  ] , he said , is food security , and the [MISC Venezuelans  ] are trying to create the infrastructure for the entire food production chain , using both public and private investment . 
As an aside , [PER Garcia  ] said that [LOC Venezuela  ] 's new finance minister , [PER Ali Rodriguez  ] , " is different " in that he is knowledgeable and can talk directly to [LOC Chavez.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked what [PER Garcia  ] thought would come of the [ORG EU  ] decision to lift its sanctions . 
[PER Garcia  ] said he did not see [PER Raul Castro  ] giving any type of concession to foreign pressure , and that the [ORG EU  ] move was a sign that there is a perception [LOC Cuba  ] is changing . 
He noted that in [LOC Brazil  ] , both businesses and the press that had been critical of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [LOC Cuba  ] policy have changed their tune . 
Businesses are now interested in investing , and there is less criticism in the press. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The Ambassador raised biofuels , stressing that although many would like to divide [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC United States  ] on the issue , we would like to continue working together . 
He recalled that Civil Household Minister [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] had pressed for President [PER Bush  ] to attend the renewables conference that [LOC Brazil  ] plans to host in November , and asked what the objective would be . 
[PER Garcia  ] said that Presidents [PER Bush  ] and [PER Lula  ] should take the issue up again at the [LOC G-8  ] in [LOC Japan  ] . 
( Comment: It has become clear over the course of conversations with foreign ministry and presidency officials that [LOC Brazil  ] is still in the initial stages of planning the conference ; they have asked for [ORG USG  ] input on the agenda and objectives . 
End comment . 
) After [PER Garcia  ] departed to meet with the [MISC Bolivian  ] ambassador , the Ambassador stressed to [PER Biato  ] that [LOC Brazil  ] 's effort to distinguish between corn and cane ethanol was not productive , and that our focus should be on the future of biofuels . 
[PER Biato  ] stressed that President [PER Lula  ] was not intending to go to [LOC Rome  ] for the [ORG FAO  ] conference , but had done so in the end when the focus of criticism fell on ethanol . 
The draft speech he had taken with him to [LOC Rome  ] had been " toughened up " there . 
[PER Biato  ] said he could not predict how [PER Lula  ] would react to the idea of lowering the tone on this issue . 
( Comment: Other contacts , however , have told us they do expect [PER Lula  ] to back away from this line .
