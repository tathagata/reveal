Friendship can be a difficult issue that requires work , [PER Abdullah  ] said , but the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] have done it for 70 years over three generations. “Our disagreements don , t cut to the bone , ” he stated. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [LOC U.S.  ] CREDIBILITY IS CRITICAL: The [ORG Bush Administration  ] is now in the past , the [PER King  ] said . 
Both President Bushes were his friends , but the recent President [ORG Bush  ] didn , t take his advice on dealing with issues in the region , and they found their problems “compounded.” The [PER King  ] said , “we are ready to consult , provide guidance and to do whatever is necessary . 
We are people of the region and we know it well.” [PER Brennan  ] responded that President [PER Obama  ] wants to listen , and asked what advice the [PER King  ] would offer to President [PER Obama  ] . 
[PER Abdullah  ] said his one piece of advice was that restoring [LOC U.S.  ] credibility in the world was critically important . 
[PER Brennan  ] responded that this was an important issue for President [PER Obama  ] as well . 
[PER Brennan  ] said that under President [PER Obama  ] we will restore our credibility .

I’m concerned about his personal safety . 
[LOC America  ] and the world need such a president.” <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) THAT WITHOUT WHICH NO [MISC SAUDI  ] MEETING IS COMPLETE: [PER Abdullah  ] said “as a friend” that “it was a mistake” to limit access of [MISC Saudi  ] citizens to the [LOC U.S.  ] , since “this damages bilateral relations and the image of the [LOC U.S.  ] in [MISC Saudi  ] Arabia.” The [PER King  ] noted there were 60,000 [MISC Saudi  ] students abroad , about one third of whom were in the [LOC U.S.  ] , and “others would have gone” but for the difficulties in gaining access to the [LOC U.S.  ] The [PER King  ] noted that for many years very senior [MISC Saudi  ] officials , including Prince Saud al-Faisal , had studied in the [LOC U.S.  ] He then noted that [MISC Saudi  ] Ambassador to the [LOC U.S.  ] , [MISC Adel  ] al [PER Jubeir  ] ( who was interpreting for the [PER King  ] ) had studied in the [LOC U.S.  ] and was “half [MISC American”  ] as a result . 
He also said he was aware of , and appreciated , Ambassador Fraker’s efforts to improve the visa situation “even though there were people in [LOC Washington  ] who fought him.” Finally , he observed that anyone from [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] who studies in the [LOC U.S.  ] inevitably becomes a friend and advocate of the [LOC United States  ] and that we only hurt ourselves by cutting off this flow of students . 
DETAINEES <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) GUANTANAMO WILL BE CLOSED: [PER Brennan  ] explained that President [PER Obama  ] had made a commitment to close [ORG Guantanamo  ] to eliminate the potential propaganda benefits its existence provided to [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] , but also because it was the right thing to do . 
[PER Brennan  ] reassured the [PER King  ] , however , that President [PER Obama  ] would remain strong on counterterrorism . 
[PER Brennan  ] presented the [PER King  ] with a letter from President [PER Obama  ] addressing the issue of [MISC Yemeni  ] detainees at [LOC Guantanamo  ] .

Returning to the subject later in the conversation , [PER Brennan  ] warned that the [LOC U.S.  ] feared [LOC Yemen  ] could become another [MISC Waziristan  ] , and urged that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] needed to work together to keep [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] in [LOC Yemen  ] from growing even more dangerous . 
The [PER King  ] replied that having [LOC Somalia  ] next door to [LOC Yemen  ] only adds to the danger . 
[PER Brennan  ] said that the capabilities of the [ORG Ministry of the Interior  ] security forces had grown impressively over the past 10 years . 
[PER Brennan  ] added that counterterrorism and intelligence sharing cooperation between our countries had never been better and that [PER MbN  ] deserved the credit . 
In an unusual concession , made at the conclusion of their conversation , the [PER King  ] said , “be assured I am fully briefed on the work you are doing with Prince [PER Mohammed  ] bin [PER Nayef.”  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) HOW TO TRACK DETAINEES: “I’ve just thought of something , ” the [PER King  ] added , and proposed implanting detainees with an electronic chip containing information about them and allowing their movements to be tracked with [ORG Bluetooth  ] . 
This was done with horses and falcons , the [PER King  ] said . 
[PER Brennan  ] replied , “horses don , t have good lawyers , ” and that such a proposal would face legal hurdles in the [LOC U.S.  ] , but agreed that keeping track of detainees was an extremely important issue that he would review with appropriate officials when he returned to the [LOC United States  ] . 
[LOC IRAN  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 .

[PER Abdullah  ] asserted that [LOC Iran  ] is trying to set up [MISC Hizballah-like  ] organizations in [MISC African  ] countries , observing that the [MISC Iranians  ] don’t think they are doing anything wrong and don’t recognize their mistakes. “I said ( to [PER Mottaki  ] ) that’s your problem , ” recounted the [PER King  ] . 
[PER Abdullah  ] said he would favor [PER Rafsanjani  ] in an [MISC Iranian  ] election , were he to run . 
He described [LOC Iran  ] not as “a neighbor one wants to see , ” but as “a neighbor one wants to avoid.” He said the [MISC Iranians  ] “launch missiles with the hope of putting fear in people and the world.” A solution to the [MISC Arab/Israeli  ] conflict would be a great achievement , the [PER King  ] said , but [LOC Iran  ] would find other ways to cause trouble. “Iran’s goal is to cause problems , ” he continued , “There is no doubt something unstable about them.” He described [LOC Iran  ] as “adventurous in the negative sense , ” and declared “May [PER God  ] prevent us from falling victim to their evil.” [MISC Mottaki  ] had tendered an invitation to visit [LOC Iran  ] , but [PER Abdullah  ] said he replied “All I want is for you to spare us your evil.” Summarizing his history with [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Abdullah  ] concluded: “We have had correct relations over the years , but the bottom line is that they cannot be trusted.” <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 .

In the years since , the [PER King  ] noted , the channel had never been used. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) A DANGEROUS NEIGHBORHOOD: [PER Brennan  ] responded that the [MISC Saudis  ] lived in a dangerous neighborhood with [LOC Iran  ] across the [LOC Gulf  ] , with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] sharing a long border with [LOC Yemen  ] , and with a number of other troublesome countries nearby .
