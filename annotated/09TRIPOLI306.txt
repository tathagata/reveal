( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary . 
On April 12 , the President of [LOC Canada  ] 's [ORG Verenex Energy  ] , [PER Jim McFarland  ] , briefed the Ambassador on the difficulties he has encountered in attempting to sell his company to another foreign operator in [LOC Libya  ] , the [ORG China National Petroleum Company  ] ( [ORG CNPC  ] ) . 
The gist of the problem is that [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Oil Corporation  ] ( [ORG NOC  ] ) has blocked the transaction -- on questionable legal grounds , according to [PER McFarland  ] -- leaving [PER Verenex  ] in a state of limbo . 
Meanwhile , the [ORG NOC  ] has demanded what amounts to a pay-off in the event it permits the transaction to proceed . 
End of summary . 
2 . 
( U ) [PER Verenex  ] , a relatively small-scale oil producer that was awarded an exploration block in the [LOC Ghadames  ] area five years ago , is one of the few foreign companies that has made successful discoveries in [LOC Libya  ] . 
[PER Verenex  ] 's field has estimated reserves of 2.15 billion barrels and is expected to produce 50,000 barrels of oil per day and 50 million cubic feet of gas per day by early 2011 . 
3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In September 2008 , [PER Verenex  ] announced a corporate sale , opened confidential technical data of its [MISC Libyan  ] assets to 22 companies previously approved by the [ORG NOC  ] , and received bids for the sale . 
After five months , [PER Verenex  ] announced that it had entered into an agreement with the [ORG CNPC  ] to acquire [PER Verenex  ] for approx . 
USD 400 million . 
The deal , however , was subject to [ORG NOC  ] 's approval . 
4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER McFarland  ] said that before signing the agreement with [ORG CNPC  ] , [PER Verenex  ] was pressured by the [ORG NOC  ] to pay the [ORG NOC  ] a " bonus " equal to 10% of the value of the transaction with [ORG CNPC  ] . 
[ORG NOC  ] assured [PER Verenex  ] that the corporate sale would be quickly approved . 
But two weeks after [PER Verenex  ] announced the agreement with [ORG CNPC  ] , the [ORG NOC  ] 's chairman , [PER Shukri Ghanem  ] , announced that the [ORG NOC  ] might exercise its right of first refusal on the sale of [PER Verenex  ] -- without indicating when it might do so . 
So far , the [ORG NOC  ] has not formally informed [PER Verenex  ] of its intention to acquire the company , but has not approved the deal signed between [PER Verenex  ] and the [MISC Chinese  ] either , leaving [PER Verenex  ] in limbo . 
5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to [PER McFarland  ] , the [ORG NOC  ] 's legal basis for halting the deal is questionable . 
The [ORG NOC  ] 's pre-emptive right applies to the sale of the company 's [MISC Libyan  ] assets , not to the entire company , he said . 
[PER Verenex  ] 's strategy is to keep advocating the [ORG NOC  ] to approve the agreement signed with [ORG CNPC  ] . 
If , on the other hand , the [ORG NOC  ] chooses to proceed with its option to purchase [PER Verenex  ] , it could delay the sale further . 
6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment . 
[PER Verenex  ] 's difficulties underscore the risks foreign companies in all sectors face when doing business in [LOC Libya  ] , and with the [ORG GOL  ] in particular , where [ORG GOL  ] actions can be highly unpredictable and sometimes costly . 
[PER McFarland  ] agreed that there could be an anti-Chinese angle in the [ORG GOL  ] move , but conceded that the chances were slim . 
End comment .
