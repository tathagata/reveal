( C ) On July 6 , [LOC Chora  ] district and tribal leaders met at the district center with a team from the [ORG Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission  ] investigating civilian losses in the June fight for [LOC Chora  ] . 
Their message was clear and measured , devoid of the histrionics or exaggeration and blame for [ORG ISAF  ] that have characterized statements made by Governor [PER Monib  ] , MP [PER Abdul Khaliq Khan  ] , and others . 
[LOC Chora  ] 's leaders made three main points . 
The fight took a heavy toll on civilians in the area but [LOC Chora  ] leaders spoke only of total losses . 
Many ISAF-caused civilian losses resulted from the [ORG Taliban  ] 's tactic of fighting from positions where civilians were present . 
[MISC Dutch  ] forces must not be withdrawn from [LOC Chora  ] as this would trigger [ORG Taliban  ] re-infiltration into the area which will result in the cycle of violence repeating itself . 
END SUMMARY Background ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG PRTOFF  ] traveled via helicopter to [LOC Chora  ] July 6 with a 4-member review team from the [ORG Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission  ] ( [ORG AIHRC  ] ) . 
The team traveled to [ORG Uruzgan  ] to investigate civilian losses during the fight for [LOC Chora  ] June 15-19 ( along with several [ORG UNAMA  ] representatives ) . 
[ORG UNAMA  ] spoke to provincial government officials in [LOC Tarin Kowt  ] and stayed at Governor [PER Monib  ] 's compound but did not go along to [LOC Chora  ] , citing security concerns . 
The [ORG AIHRC  ] team and [ORG PRTOFF  ] met with District Chief [PER Mohammad Ibrahim  ] and about 20 tribal leaders . 
We also spoke to doctors from the [LOC Chora  ] clinic , select civilian victims , and the [ORG ANA  ] deployed in [LOC Chora  ] . 
The team had sent word they expected to also meet with District Chief of Police [PER Mohammed Gul  ] but he was not at the meeting . 
The [ORG Civilian Toll  ] ----------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The tribal leaders briefed the team on losses suffered by the local civilian population . 
They claimed that 87 civilians were killed and 50-60 compounds and approximately 2800 kg of wheat were destroyed . 
( Note: The number of civilian deaths is thought by [ORG Task Force Uruzgan  ] analysts to be too high because it likely includes fighting age males dressed in civilian garb who were more likely combatants . 
End Note ) They stated that most civilians were killed in houses destroyed by shelling from three sources: aerial bombardment from [ORG ISAF  ] aircraft , artillery fired from the [MISC Dutch  ] [PER Panzer Howitzer  ] in [LOC Tarin Kowt  ] , and rockets fired by the [ORG Taliban  ] 's [ORG BM1  ] and BM12 . 
Their stories were consistent with other accounts of the fighting known to [ORG PRTOFF  ] . 
Local leaders recounted the events in a calm , matter-of-fact manner with little of the emotion or exaggeration that often accompanies shura discussions of highly charged topics . 
Their presentation stood in sharp contrast to petulant statements made by Governor [PER Monib  ] and other leaders such as [PER Abdul Khaliq Khan  ] , member of the [PER Wolsei Jirga  ] for [ORG Uruzgan  ] who is from [LOC Chora  ] . 
They accused [ORG ISAF  ] of causing too many losses to local civilians with heavy-handed tactics , while simultaneously complaining bitterly of insufficient [ORG ISAF  ] responses to defend [LOC Chora  ] . 
They also want more offensive action against [ORG Taliban  ] bases allegedly far removed from population centers . 
[ORG Taliban Tactics Put Civilians in Harms Way  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Leaders declined to comment when asked by the team to say what part of the damage was caused by [ORG ISAF  ] . 
Instead , they provided examples and spoke of locals killed by [ORG Taliban  ] before and during the battle , such as the beheadings of two [LOC KABUL  ] 00002249 002 OF 003 militia members loyal to pro-GOA militia leaders in the days leading up to the [ORG Taliban  ] 's big attack June 16 . 
They also talked vividly about [ORG Taliban  ] tactics that purposely put civilians in danger of [ORG ISAF  ] counterattacks ( bombs and direct fire ) . 
For example , in the village of [LOC Qal'a-i-Ragh  ] , one villager ( [PER Jano Aqa  ] ) said that [ORG Taliban  ] fighting in and around his compound led [ORG ISAF  ] to target the location , killing 18 members of his family and hospitalizing [PER Aqa  ] . 
In another case , as local residents were leaving the district center to return to their homes at the urging of local leaders , [ORG Taliban  ] fired an RPG at a nearby [MISC Dutch  ] armored vehicle , reportedly triggering renewed [ORG ISAF  ] fire and causing residents to once again seek refuge and to refuse to return to their homes . 
Dear [MISC Dutch  ] , [ORG Please Don't Go  ] --------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During the shura , the leaders expressed their fear that the [ORG Taliban  ] would likely attack [LOC Chora  ] again this summer . 
They noted that [ORG Taliban  ] had returned to their sanctuaries to the north in [LOC Gizab  ] and to the south in the [MISC Baluchi  ] pass , as well as in the [LOC Darefshan Valley  ] to regroup . 
They implored the international troops to either bring security to this area or tell us to leave. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) At the end of the shura , while victims were talking to the human rights commission representatives , two tribal leaders approached [ORG PRTOFF  ] to press the point further . 
They believed the [MISC Dutch  ] were under pressure from President [PER Karzai  ] and Governor [PER Monib  ] to abandon the district center building ( aka [ORG White Compound  ] ) where the [MISC Dutch  ] camp out when in [LOC Chora  ] and that this was the cause of [MISC Dutch  ] plans to remove their troops , leaving only [ORG ANSF  ] to maintain security . 
( Note: [MISC Dutch  ] occupation of this USAID-funded government building has indeed been a bone of contention with the district chief and provincial governor , but the [MISC Dutch  ] are willing to move if allowed to rent a nearby compound in reasonable condition for a reasonable price . 
End Note . 
) They argued that the [MISC ANSF  ] were not yet strong enough in numbers or ability to repel the expected renewed [ORG Taliban  ] push into the area . 
If the [MISC Dutch  ] leave as they did in May , the tribal leaders assessed that the [ORG Taliban  ] will inevitably try to take the district center once again , necessitating the [MISC Dutch  ] to fight hard to regain lost ground , bombard the area and kill civilians , thus repeating the cycle . 
If the [MISC Dutch  ] stayed , the tribal leaders argued , the cycle of violence remains broken and local residents can get back to normal life . 
Later in the week , [LOC Chora  ] leaders reportedly sent a letter to President [PER Karzai  ] making similar arguments for retaining [ORG ISAF  ] 's presence in the vicinity. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [MISC Dutch  ] commander indeed had stated his intent to withdraw from [LOC Chora  ] by July 12 . 
However , on Saturday , July 7 , the [ORG TFU  ] command staff reversed this position and decided to maintain a permanent presence in [LOC Chora  ] for the time being . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] will continue to secure [LOC Chora  ] while local police are trained and more [MISC Afghan  ] forces are sought for the province and the [LOC Chora  ] area in particular . 
[ORG Iranian Training Bases  ] in [LOC Gizab  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [PER C/REL NATO/AUS  ] ) Local leaders claimed that people traveling through [LOC Chora  ] from [LOC Gizab  ] district told them that [MISC Iranians  ] were training [ORG Taliban  ] fighters in [LOC Gizab  ] . 
One person well known to the [ORG PRT  ] said the training camp was in [PER Beirai  ] ( phonetic ) , a village in a [LOC Hazara  ] area of [LOC Gizab  ] , but the tribal leaders were unable to provide more specific information . 
( Note: [LOC Gizab  ] has been under [ORG Taliban  ] control since March 2006 ; there is no [ORG GOA  ] presence there , and no [MISC Afghan  ] or international forces have attempted to address this problem to date . 
End Note ) Comment ------- [LOC KABUL  ] 00002249 003 OF 003 <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [LOC Chora  ] leaders' decision to take a factual , pragmatic approach makes their story and pleas all the more credible . 
They seem to instinctively realize that it is not in their interest to complain loudly about civilian losses . 
And they are right . 
The political backlash this would cause here and in the [LOC Netherlands  ] could force the [MISC Dutch  ] military to end their current presence in the area , leaving residents once again vulnerable to [ORG Taliban  ] attack . 
In fact , [LOC Chora  ] leaders now are lobbying the [MISC Dutch  ] to establish an international forward operating base in the area and have volunteered to provide land for the purpose . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are not inclined to do so , feeling that such a base would tax their resources beyond acceptable limits . 
However , they are beginning to consider the possibility of suggesting that the [ORG GOA  ] establish an [MISC ANA  ] base there supported by [MISC Dutch  ] trainers . 
Regardless of what action is taken , all seem to have realized that local residents and international troops alike are better off continuing to work together in [LOC Chora  ] to keep the [ORG Taliban  ] out .
