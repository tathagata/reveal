The Creation of a [ORG New Ministry  ] of the [LOC Interior  ] --------------------------------------------- --- 2 . 
( U ) On December 4 , the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] announced its plans to dissolve the [ORG Icelandic Defense Agency  ] ( [ORG IDA  ] ) and to integrate its duties into a new [ORG Ministry of the Interior  ] . 
The new ministry will merge two current ministries - the [ORG Ministry of Transportation  ] , Communications and Local Government and the [ORG Ministry of Justice and Human Rights  ] . 
The ministry will also incorporate portions of other public agencies , such as the [ORG IDA  ] , which currently falls under the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) The [ORG MFA  ] , in a public statement , tasked a five person committee with organizing the merger and ensuring that it occurs in a responsible manner . 
The committee will consist of one member from each of five government entities ( the [ORG Ministries of Justice  ] , [ORG Transportation  ] , [ORG Finance  ] and [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] , and the [ORG Office of the Prime Minister  ] ) . 
The committee is expected to reach a decision on the logistics of the merger by February and the task should be completed by the end of 2010 . 
( Comment . 
The committee includes members of entities directly affected by the merger and also those with political interests in the matter , i.e. the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] . 
End comment . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The general approach to this reorganization is largely consistent with what [ORG Foreign Minister  ] [PER Ossur Skarpedinsson  ] described to us in September ( reftel ) . 
At that time , the Minister indicated that the plan would be set in motion by the end of the year . 
In recent weeks , however , key [ORG MFA  ] contacts had not indicated that the announcement was imminent , no doubt because it was with the Minister . 
The Minister 's [ORG Political Advisor  ] told Charge on December 10 that three people had made this decision: the Prime Minister , the [ORG Foreign Minister  ] and the Finance Minister ( who is chairman of the Left [MISC Greens  ] ) . 
( [PER Note: Given  ] the Prime Minister 's general deference to the Foreign Minister on such matters , it is likely that the latter was the real decision maker and that he sought to move the issue forward quickly . 
End note . 
) A Pledge to Continue [ORG NATO  ] Commitments -------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The Permanent Secretary at the [ORG Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] , [PER Einar Gunnarsson  ] , told Charge and Poloff on December 11 that the creation of the new ministry is , first and foremost , the coalition fulfilling its promise to streamline the government and make it more efficient . 
The government , he said , had pledged to reduce the total number of ministries from twelve to eight and is now fulfilling this campaign promise . 
[PER Gunnarsson  ] acknowledged that there is also a modicum of politics involved in the decision and did not dispute the idea that the Left [MISC Greens  ] , the junior partners in the government coalition , have supported the dissolution of the [ORG IDA  ] for quite some time . 
Nonetheless , he stated that the process would occur responsibly and transparently. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Gunnarsson  ] underscored that the new [ORG Ministry of the Interior  ] would maintain [LOC Iceland  ] 's commitments to [ORG NATO  ] . 
[LOC Iceland  ] , he said , will continue to maintain the [ORG Icelandic Air Defense System  ] ( [ORG IADS  ] ) and all other [ORG NATO  ] infrastructure in the country . 
According to [PER Gunnarsson  ] , [LOC Iceland  ] will also continue to participate in exercises such as [ORG Northern Viking  ] and the [ORG NATO  ] air policing missions . 
This merger , he said , represents a change in form , but not in substance , for the country 's defense activities . 
[ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000221 002 OF 002 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) According to the [MISC British  ] Ambassador , Foreign Minister [PER Skarpedinsson  ] offered similar reassurances at a luncheon of [ORG EU  ] member embassies on December 14 . 
He reported to Charge that the Minister had said the restructuring was a " machinery of government " issue and not part of coalition horse trading . 
Concerns Regarding the Merger ------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) On the other hand , the current Director of the [ORG Icelandic Defense Agency  ] , [PER Tinna Vidisdottir  ] , expressed grave reservations to [ORG Emboffs  ] regarding the decision to dissolve the [ORG IDA  ] and said she doubts that the process will occur in a responsible manner . 
The decision , she said , was undertaken for the sole purpose of mollifying the Left [MISC Greens  ] . 
[PER Vidisdottir  ] said that the Left [MISC Greens  ] have historically opposed [LOC Iceland  ] 's involvement in any organization with military connotations and the dissolution of the [ORG IDA  ] is their reward for going along with their coalition partners , the [MISC Social Democrats  ] , on controversial measures such as [ORG EU  ] membership and the [ORG Icesave  ] bill. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Vidisdottir  ] opined that the merger would occur in a reckless manner . 
The committee tasked with this undertaking , she posited , will largely be comprised of technocrats who lack the necessary qualifications to handle the task . 
She feared that decisions would be made based upon finances rather than [LOC Iceland  ] 's strategic interests and shared with [ORG Emboffs  ] a rumor that , she said , supported this contention . 
The responsibility for monitoring the [ORG IADS  ] , she said , could potentially be transferred to [LOC Iceland  ] 's emergency hotline system , primarily as a means to pump extra funds into that cash starved entity . 
" Can you imagine , " she asked , " the 911 dispatchers in the [LOC United States  ] taking over the duties of [LOC NORAD  ] ? 
" ( Comment: While [PER Vidisdottir  ] is competent , she has alienated many people with her outspoke style . 
She may not be totally objective in assessing this matter . 
End comment . 
) Comment --------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The truth regarding the merger probably lies somewhere in between the assurances of [PER Gunnarsson  ] and [PER Skarpedinsson  ] and [PER Vidisdottir  ] 's warnings . 
There is little doubt that the merger is politically motivated . 
It is hard to say , however , whether this decision followed the government 's original timetable or was a more desperate step by a weak government confronting tough votes on [ORG Icesave  ] , tax hikes and the budget . 
The shift of most [ORG IDA  ] functions to a new ministry rather than leaving them at [ORG MFA  ] and [ORG Justice  ] as [PER Skarpedinsson  ] had predicted in September , would appear to indicate the need for the [MISC Social Democrats  ] to show some support for their coalition partner . 
One former [ORG MFA  ] official who is still in government confirmed that the shape and timing of the reshuffle was a concession to the Left [MISC Greens  ] to bolster the coalition as it faces key votes . 
If the dissolution of the [ORG IDA  ] were to occur , it would be the first issue on which the pacifist Left [MISC Greens  ] won support for their position . 
So far the Left [MISC Greens  ] have yielded to the [MISC Social Democrats  ] on joining the [ORG European Union  ] , supporting the government on [ORG Icesave  ] , and lowering taxes on energy use . 
Nonetheless , despite the political rationale behind the decision , there is no reason to suspect that the undertaking will not be carried out responsibly. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) We have discussed the matter with like-minded counterparts in the diplomatic community and agreed to monitor closely the situation to make sure that no key commitments fall through the cracks during this government reshuffling . 
We have also mentioned to [ORG MFA  ] officials the possibility of inviting strategic experts to come to [LOC Iceland  ] and share their expertise during this transitional period . 
[ORG MFA  ] officials , however , have cited a lengthy study ( 2007 ) which concludes that [LOC Iceland  ] faces no military threats and needs to consider only nonconventional threats as a basis for their strategic approach . 
There is concern on their part that any discussion , private or public , on the broad topic of defense could backfire and reopen a debate on whether [LOC Iceland  ] belongs in [ORG NATO  ] . 
For this reason , the working group will focus on safer operational decisions , rather than strategic ones .
