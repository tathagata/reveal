D ) THE HAGUE 1978 Classified By: Amb [PER Roland Arnall  ] ; reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] During his September 12 visit to The [ORG Hague  ] , [ORG EUR  ] PDAS [PER Volker  ] discussed the road to [LOC Riga  ] , detainee policy , [LOC Lebanon  ] , [ORG ICTY  ] compliance ( septel ) , [LOC Guatemala  ] 's [ORG UNSC  ] bid , contacts with [LOC Syria  ] ( ref b ) , [ORG OSCE  ] reform and presidency , the [ORG Arms Trade Treaty  ] concept , [ORG JSF  ] , and energy security . 
He met with [ORG GONL  ] officials , parliamentarians , and journalists , and delivered a speech to the influential [ORG Netherlands Atlantic Association  ] . 
[PER Volker  ] defended [LOC U.S.  ] detainee policy , saying that President [PER Bush  ] recognized the need to address negative perceptions and is working with [ORG Congress  ] to reach a comprehensive legal solution . 
Following up on discussions held September 8 by visiting [ORG USNATO Permrep Nuland  ] ( ref c ) , [PER Volker  ] underlined the importance of two issues: resolving troop shortfalls in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and making progress on the global partnership initiative . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Volker  ] held in-depth discussions with [MISC Dutch  ] interagency representatives , including MFA Deputy Director General for Political Affairs Wim [PER Geerts  ] ; MFA Director of [ORG Security Policy Robert  ] de [PER Groot  ] ; the Prime Minister 's [ORG Foreign Policy Advisor  ] , [PER Karel van Oosterem  ] ; and MOD Deputy Director for [ORG Defense Policy  ] , [PER Jan Geert Siccama  ] . 
The road to [LOC Riga  ] ---------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Geerts  ] pressed for a unifying political message at [LOC Riga  ] , and reiterated [MISC Dutch  ] concern that explicitly stating [ORG NATO  ] is a global organization would be divisive . 
He suggested emphasizing [ORG NATO  ] 's role " " as an organization with the knowledge and capabilities for stabilization operations " " worldwide . 
He feared that there was still not enough substance on the agenda for [LOC Riga  ] , and thought that [MISC French  ] obstructionism - which he termed worse than at any other time in recent memory - was largely to blame . 
He argued for including the [ORG EU  ] and [ORG UN  ] on the margins , an idea [PER Volker  ] discouraged . 
MOD 's [PER Siccama  ] suggested that the [ORG NATO Response Force  ] ( [ORG NRF  ] ) be declared fully operational at [LOC Riga  ] , even if not all the requirements had actually been met . 
[LOC Georgia  ] [ORG Intensified Dialogue  ] and Enlargement -------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [LOC France  ] , [LOC Germany  ] and the [LOC UK  ] are all concerned about [MISC Georgian  ] volatility , said [PER Volker  ] , and this is causing them to second-guess themselves on the [ORG Intensified Dialogue  ] . 
But [LOC ID  ] for [LOC Georgia  ] would , he said , actually contribute to stability . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] would prefer , [PER Volker  ] added , that the [ORG North Atlantic Council  ] ( [ORG NAC  ] ) meet prior to the September 21 Ministerial in [LOC New York  ] , so that Ministers could openly discuss the decision afterward . 
[PER De Groot  ] said the [MISC Dutch  ] could go either way. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER De Groot  ] and [PER Geerts  ] repeated [MISC Dutch  ] concerns that [MISC Ukrainian  ] membership apirations were moving in the wrong direction and that now was not the time to discuss expansion . 
[PER Volker  ] urged the [MISC Dutch  ] to support at least mentioning the aspirations of [LOC Ukraine  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] . 
He recommended the summit document say that enlargement has historically been a success and that it set a date certain for [LOC Balkans  ] decisions . 
He said we needed to hear from [LOC Ukraine  ] how it wanted to proceed with [ORG NATO  ] , and support them as far as they were prepared to go at this time . 
Global Partnership ------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG NATO  ] needs to develop its ability to work together with partners around the world , to deal with emerging crises , said [PER Volker  ] . 
We need one toolbox , he added , without firewalls . 
He acknowledged that [LOC Japan  ] and [LOC Korea  ] have shown only lukewarm interest in open-ended consultations , to which [PER Geerts  ] replied the [MISC Dutch  ] are keen to try , with one or two other countries , to prepare an options paper . 
[PER De Groot  ] suggested the [MISC Germans  ] might be useful in this , though it needed to be discrete and done outside the [ORG NATO  ] conference rooms . 
[PER Volker  ] said he would be interested in helping shape any [MISC Dutch  ] ideas on the subject discreetly in advance , and we should in any case see how the discussions go in [LOC New York  ] , as this will be an issue we expect Ministers to discuss . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] THE HAGUE 00002047 002 OF 004 ----------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [MISC Dutch  ] repeated their frustration with [PER Karzai  ] ( ref c ) and hoped we would press him while he was in [LOC Washington  ] . 
The army and police needed to be adequately paid , and they needed uniforms and resources . 
[PER Geerts  ] said he had traveled with PM Balkenende in August to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and it was his distinct impression that [PER Karzai  ] says all the right things but delivers nothing . 
[PER Karzai  ] has no policy , no reconciliation program in the [LOC South  ] , de [PER Groot  ] contributed , adding , " " We can't win with this . 
" " [PER Geerts  ] suggested the need for increased consultation in [LOC Kabul  ] among allied representatives , to bring more pressure on [PER Karzai  ] . 
He echoed the [LOC U.S.  ] suggestion ( ref c ) that [ORG NATO  ] senior civilian representative , [MISC Dutch  ] Ambassador [PER Daan Everts  ] , take the lead . 
[PER Volker  ] floated a suggestion , that [MISC Afghan  ] Coordinators from [ORG NATO  ] allies might also get together prior to [PER Riga.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Geerts  ] said that [ORG ISAF  ] must make progress on the ground before the onset of winter . 
[PER Volker  ] noted that [ORG NATO  ] must also resolve the [ORG ISAF  ] troop shortfall , prior to [LOC Riga  ] . 
He expressed support for [MISC Dutch  ] and [LOC UK  ] efforts on that . 
If [LOC Afghanistan  ] is in bad shape when leaders gather at [LOC Riga  ] , it could overshadow the summit . 
But if we do our job well be fore [LOC Riga  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] would be one example among many of how [ORG NATO  ] is fulfilling global responsibilities . 
[ORG UNSC  ] GRULAC race: [MISC Dutch  ] still playing it close --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Volker  ] urged the [MISC Dutch  ] to support [LOC Guatemala  ] 's lobbying effort , particularly in [LOC Asia  ] and [LOC Africa  ] , where we think the race will be decided . 
He asked the [MISC Dutch  ] to consider the credibility of the [ORG UN  ] , particularly in the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Congress  ] , if [LOC Venezuela  ] were to gain a seat . 
[PER Chavez  ] would use the [ORG UNSC  ] , he said , to support the " " [MISC Bolivarian Revolution  ] " " elsewhere in [LOC South America  ] , to attack the [LOC U.S.  ] and to make life easier for rogue states. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [LOC Guatemala  ] , by contrast , is democratic , has made tremendous human rights gains , and is a contributor to [ORG UN  ] peacekeeping operations ( including the [ORG DRC  ] , where they lost eight troops ) . 
" " We are not seeing strong views , " " coming from the [ORG EU  ] , he added . 
[PER Geerts  ] responded , de rigour , " " [LOC Venezuela  ] is a neighboring country of the [MISC Kingdom of The Netherlands  ] . 
We will act discreetly . 
" " In a separate meeting with MFA Director General for Political Affairs [PER Pieter de Gooijer  ] , Ambassador [PER Arnall  ] and [PER Volker  ] again raised the issue . 
[PER De Gooijer  ] quietly affirmed that he expected The [LOC Netherlands  ] to support [LOC Guatemala  ] . 
[LOC Lebanon  ] ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The [ORG GONL  ] is still considering the possibility of sending a frigate , said [PER Geerts  ] , to operate with the [MISC Germans  ] under [ORG NATO  ] auspices . 
The cabinet will look into it , he said , but not if the [MISC Lebanese  ] maintain their insistence on a 6 mile barrier . 
[PER Geerts  ] then turned to [LOC Lebanon  ] reconstruction , expressing interest in the results of the joint [MISC U.S.-UK  ] assessment mission . 
[PER Volker  ] expressed our concern that the money get to the right people , and put forward the idea of a trust fund , in case some allies wanted to contribute but did not have sufficient personnel to place on the ground . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] , who had proposed a [ORG NATO  ] clearinghouse possibility , expressed interest . 
OSCE: [MISC Dutch  ] support [MISC Kazakh  ] bid ------------------------------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Volker  ] acknowledged continuing [MISC Russian  ] efforts to constrain [ORG OSCE  ] democracy promotion efforts , but said that we were hopeful of closing out the reform package . 
We are trying to shine the spotlight , he said , on frozen conflicts and increase attention to proper treatment of [ORG NGOs  ] . 
He added that we absolutely will not consider raising our contribution when the budget is reviewed under the [MISC Spanish  ] chairmanship. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Volker  ] said the [MISC Kazakhs  ] were receiving mixed messages on their bid for Chairman in Office , including expressions of [MISC German  ] support . 
[PER Geerts  ] said that FM Bot , too , had recently informed the [MISC Kazakhs  ] that the [ORG GONL  ] would support their bid . 
[PER Volker  ] replied that a [MISC Kazakh  ] presidency now would not be credible , given [LOC Kazakhstan  ] 's recent election and lack of progress on democracy . 
An [ORG OSCE  ] Chairman on Office needs to represent fulfillment of [ORG OSCE  ] principles . 
We have told them that we would be willing to support them later , he said , provided their actions reflect [ORG OSCE  ] principles on democracy . 
[PER Volker  ] said that to unravel this , we should support [LOC Greece  ] THE HAGUE 00002047 003.3 OF 004 for 2009 , [LOC Lithuania  ] for 2010 and consider [LOC Kazakhstan  ] again for 2011 . 
[ORG Arms Trade Treaty  ] ----------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Geerts  ] said that The [LOC Netherlands  ] supports giving a group of experts a mandate to explore the possibilities of such a treaty . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are remaining quiet in their support , though , to avoid the perception that the treaty is a " " western " " idea . 
He hoped that the [LOC U.S.  ] would not vote against the measure , at the [ORG UNGA  ] . 
[ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] -------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Geerts  ] and de [PER Groot  ] believed the prosepcts of a [ORG JSF  ] MOU prior to the November 22 elections looked increasingly unlikely . 
Labor ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) , they said , is clearly coming out against [ORG JSF  ] , and it is far from certain that sufficient votes exist to gain approval prior to Parliament 's November 1 pre-election recess . 
[PER Geerts  ] added that the issue had become extremely sensitive . 
[PER Volker  ] urged the [MISC Dutch  ] to make the case for [ORG JSF  ] . 
Energy security --------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) The [LOC Netherlands  ] , said [PER Geerts  ] , wanted to avoid becoming overly dependent on [MISC Russian  ] energy . 
They needed to secure alternate sources , he said , and at the same time have options to make life difficult for the [MISC Russians  ] . 
Some [ORG EU  ] countries would , he believed , allow energy concerns to affect their relations with [LOC Russia  ] . 
He liked the language developed for the Energy Security Conference , scheduled for this spring but cancelled . 
He suggested we continue a dialogue on this . 
Detainee issues: [MISC Dutch  ] criticism remains heated --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) MFA Director General for Political Affairs [PER Pieter de Gooijer  ] dedicated his entire 30 minute meeting with [PER Volker  ] to detainee issues . 
[PER De Gooijer  ] was focused exclusively on the delicate situation in which Foreign Minister Bot has found himself ( refs a and d ) , and the need for us to be sensitive to this in our public statements and meetings with parliamentarians. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [MISC Parliamentarians  ] [PER Bert Koenders  ] and [PER Hans van Baalen  ] , foreign policy spokesmen for the [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) and the conservative [MISC Liberals  ] ( [ORG VVD  ] ) , respectively , both focused largely on detainee issues . 
[PER Koenders  ] , a strong supporter of the transatlantic relationship , was one of the instigators of the parliamentary debate on secret prisons ( ref a ) . 
As van [PER Baalen  ] explained , in a separate meeting , President [PER Bush  ] 's speech September 6 provided the ideal opportunity for the left to attack the credibility of Bot and his governing [MISC Christian Democrats  ] . 
[PER Van Baalen  ] , whose [MISC Liberals  ] are junior coalition partners , added , though , that even within his own party , there was real concern that the [LOC U.S.  ] was drifting away from shared transatlantic values . 
He said that he shared concern over lack of due process in secret prisons , but promised that Liberal criticism would remain well-reasoned as long as he was around. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( U ) In talks with de [PER Gooijer  ] , [PER Koenders  ] , and van [PER Baalen  ] , as well as in remarks to the [ORG Netherlands Atlantic Association  ] and interviews with journalists , [PER Volker  ] vigorously defended the President 's decisions on removing all detainees from [ORG CIA  ] detention facilities , guaranteeing [ORG ICRC  ] access , and guanranteeing appropriate treatment under [ORG Common Article  ] 3 of the [ORG Geneva Conventions  ] , the Detainee [ORG Treatment Act  ] and the newly issued [ORG Army Field Manual  ] . 
Questions dealt almost exclusively with detainee issues and [MISC Dutch  ] concern that [LOC U.S.  ] detainee policy had strayed from a commitment to rule of law and due process . 
[PER Volker  ] emphasized repeatedly that this was not the case , and indeed that President [PER Bush  ] had taken steps to comprehensively address the legal issues , treatment issues , and underlying values issues that had been of concern to many [MISC Europeans  ] . 
[PER Volker  ] explained that the President had now gone to [ORG Congress  ] and was asking it to consider legislation that would provide a comprehensive legal solution to the problems encountered in the war on terror , consistent with the recent [ORG Supreme Court  ] ruling. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( U ) Despite [PER Volker  ] 's repeated focus on the positive decisions taken by the President , [MISC Dutch  ] media chose to focus coverage of his visit on the fact that , while the detainees THE HAGUE 00002047 004 OF 004 had been removed from [ORG CIA  ] detention , the [ORG CIA  ] program itself remained in place . 
These stories , in turn , factored into [MISC Dutch  ] parliamentary hearings on the subject on September 13 , and prompted several prominent politicians ( including FM Bot , [PER Koenders  ] , and van [PER Baalen  ] ) to express deep disappointment with the [LOC U.S.  ] position. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( U ) PDAS [PER Volker  ] cleared on this cable .
