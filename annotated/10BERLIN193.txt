( [ORG S  ] ) Summary . 
During a February 6 meeting on the margins of the [ORG Munich Security Conference  ] , [MISC Israeli  ] Deputy FM [PER Ayalon  ] told [PER U/S Tauscher  ] that his country 's top security concerns were the [ORG Qualitative Military Edge  ] ( QME ) and proposals for a [LOC Middle East Nuclear Free Zone  ] . 
[PER Ayalon  ] also said that his government would provide a response to a [ORG USG  ] nonpaper on elements for dealing with [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Middle East  ] issues at the upcoming [ORG NPT Review Conference  ] . 
[PER Tauscher  ] emphasized the need to engage with [LOC Egypt  ] , but promised that the [LOC U.S.  ] would not put [LOC Israel  ] on the spot in the course of its bilateral discussions with [LOC Cairo  ] . 
[PER Tauscher  ] also suggested that the [ORG P3 Israel  ] first agree on the scope of an agreement and then , perhaps , engage directly with [MISC Egyptian  ] President [PER Mubarak  ] . 
End Summary. -------------------------------------------- [ORG NPT Revcon  ] and [LOC Middle East Nuclear Free Zone  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Tauscher  ] expressed concern about the prospects for a successful 2010 [ORG NPT Review Conference  ] in light of the row over [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program and [LOC Egypt  ] 's controversial proposals on [LOC Middle East  ] nuclear issues . 
In particular , [PER Tauscher  ] noted that [LOC Egypt  ] had repeatedly disrupted prior RevCons over this issue without being made to pay a price . 
This year , she said , the [ORG USG  ] wanted to be proactive and has begun engaging [LOC Egypt  ] early in order to find a way forward . 
However , [PER Tauscher  ] emphasized that the [LOC U.S.  ] would consult with [LOC Tel Aviv  ] and not put [LOC Israel  ] in a difficult position during the course of bilateral talks with [LOC Cairo  ] . 
The goal , she said , would be to convince [LOC Egypt  ] to abandon its normal approach to these issues and engage in a more productive dialogue on issues of concern in the [LOC Middle East  ] and support [LOC U.S.  ] objectives. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Ayalon  ] lamented continuing recalcitrance by [MISC Egyptian  ] FM Aboul-Gheit on this issue and asked whether the [LOC U.S.  ] had taken up this discussion directly with President [PER Mubarak  ] . 
[PER Tauscher  ] underscored that the [LOC U.S.  ] had not yet engaged actively with [PER Mubarak  ] in order to first come to agreement with the [ORG P3  ] ( [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC UK  ] , [LOC France  ] ) and [LOC Israel  ] . 
Drilling down on tactics , [PER Tauscher  ] stressed that the [LOC U.S.  ] did not intend to offer [LOC Egypt  ] a compromise solution all at once but , instead , would offer different components contained in the elements papers during the course of negotiations . 
She also emphasized the need to reach agreement among the [ORG P3 Israel  ] by the end of March -- at the latest . 
April , [PER Tauscher  ] stressed , would be too late to successfully engage with [LOC Egypt  ] before the [ORG NPT Revcon  ] in May . 
As a result , the [ORG USG  ] hoped for [MISC Israeli  ] comments to its proposed negotiating strategy soon . 
[PER Ayalon  ] thanked [PER U/S Tauscher  ] for the clarification on the [LOC U.S.  ] approach and promised to provide answers on the [LOC U.S.  ] elements paper . 
He noted that [LOC Tel Aviv  ] had been concerned that the [LOC U.S.  ] would provide the whole paper to [MISC Egyptian  ] officials , who could have pocketed those suggestions as an opening position. --------------- Missile Defense --------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Ayalon  ] asked for an update on [LOC U.S.  ] missle defense efforts as well as advances in [LOC MD  ] in the [LOC Gulf  ] states . 
[PER Tauscher  ] noted the recent agreement by [LOC Romania  ] to host [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC SM-3s  ] as part of the [MISC Phased  ] , [ORG Adaptive Approach  ] and said the [ORG USG  ] was working on a location for radar . 
Regarding [LOC MD  ] in the [LOC Gulf  ] states , [PER Tauscher  ] noted that UAE was acquiring [MISC THAADs  ] , and that [MISC Kuwaiti  ] , [MISC Bahraini  ] , and [MISC Qatari  ] had interest in Patriot missiles . 
[PER Ayalon  ] noted that [LOC Israel  ] was working on its [LOC MD  ] technology as well. -------------------------------------- [ORG Russia Post START and Nuclear Treaties  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In response to questions about progress on concluding a new START agreement , [PER Tauscher  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Russia  ] were about " 95 percent " of the way there . 
Specifically , she noted , the technical annexes were cumbersome and were taking longer than expected . 
[PER Tauscher  ] also conveyed her expectation [LOC BERLIN  ] 00000193 002 OF 002 that post-START would likely be the only defense treaty ratified by the [LOC U.S.  ] in 2010 . 
The [MISC CTBT  ] , she said would likely meet with lukewarm support in [ORG Congress  ] this year . 
Meanwhile , [LOC Pakistan  ] continued to block the start of [MISC FMCT  ] negotiations in the Conference on [ORG Disarmament.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) This cable was cleared with [PER U/S Tauscher  ] .
