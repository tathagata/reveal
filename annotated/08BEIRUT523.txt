( [ORG S  ] ) Requesting a special meeting with Charge , Telecommunications Minister [PER Marwan Hamadeh  ] decried the establishment of a complete fiber optics network by [ORG Hizballah  ] throughout [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
The [ORG GOL  ] has been sharing this information widely among friends of [LOC Lebanon  ] , to include the governments of [LOC France  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC Jordan  ] , and the [LOC UAE  ] . 
[PER Hamadeh  ] sees only two choices for the [MISC GOL:  ] approach the [ORG UN Security Council  ] , or use the “cover” of March 14-friendly municipalities to cut the lines . 
However , he questioned whether the [ORG Lebanese Armed Forces  ] ( [ORG LAF  ] ) and the [ORG Internal Security Forces  ] ( [ORG ISF  ] ) have the “guts” to do so , given that [ORG Hizballah  ] already stated to [MISC Lebanese  ] security officials that it would view this as equal to an [MISC Israeli  ] act of aggression , and would then take action against the [ORG GOL  ] . 
[PER Hamadeh  ] hopes that [PER Saad Hariri  ] , now in [LOC Geneva  ] , will return soon to [LOC Lebanon  ] so that March 14 can meet to formulate a strategy . 
End summary . 
[ORG GOL  ] HAS BEEN SHARING [ORG HIZBALLAH  ] FIBER OPTIC MAP , REPORT WIDELY ------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) &Iran Telecom is taking over the country ! 8 were the first words out of the mouth of Minister of Telecommunications [PER Marwan Hamadeh  ] when he met with Charge and Econoff on April 16 . 
He was referring to the discovery of a complete fiber optic system ( [ORG FiOS  ] ) installed by [ORG Hizballah  ] throughout [LOC Lebanon  ] - reftel . 
In addition , [ORG Hizballah  ] has introduced [MISC Wi-Max  ] in Beirut’s southern suburbs . 
[PER Hamadeh  ] pointed out that although [ORG Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation  ] ( [ORG LBC  ] ) television had run a story the previous night about the [ORG Hizballah  ] [ORG FiOS  ] network , it was already widely known . 
The [ORG LBC  ] story was not planted by the [ORG GOL  ] , nor planned , but in Hamadeh’s opinion it was no bad thing to get the story out there . 
[PER Hamadeh  ] himself has been sharing the news both within the [ORG GOL  ] and outside , with &friends , 8 which includes the [MISC Arab  ] countries , the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC France  ] ( [ORG Sarkozy  ] was &stunned” ) and [PER Terje Roed-Larsen  ] of the [ORG UN  ] . 
He briefed [PER Bernard Kouchner  ] , [PER Jean-David Levitte  ] , [PER Boris Bouillon  ] and [PER Michel Barnier  ] while in [LOC Paris  ] . 
In [LOC Beirut  ] he spoke to Charge [PER Andre Parent  ] of [LOC France  ] and Ambassador [PER Abdul Aziz Khoja  ] of [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
[PER Saad Hariri  ] , when he heard , sent a private plane from [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] to pick up a copy of the map , which traces in detail the route of the system , to share with [MISC Saudi  ] King [PER Abdullah  ] and Intelligence Chief Prince Mukrin bin [MISC Abdul-Aziz  ] . 
PM [PER Siniora  ] briefed the [MISC Jordanians  ] and [MISC Emiratis  ] , as well as [ORG Arab League SYG Amr Musa  ] on the network during his recent trip around the region , [PER Hamadeh  ] confirmed . 
Within [LOC Lebanon  ] [PER Hamadeh  ] says that the first person he told , after the Prime Minister and [MISC Druze  ] leader [PER Walid Jumblatt  ] was [ORG Maronite Patriarch Sfeir  ] . 
[PER Hamadeh  ] described the strategic implications of the [ORG Hizballah  ] plan , which he says is targeting the [MISC Christian  ] areas , despite a denial of that by [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
In addition to [PER Hamadeh  ] and PM [PER Siniora  ] , [MISC Druze  ] leader [PER Walid Jumblatt  ] and Defense Minister [PER Michel Murr  ] have been active in the GL information campaign on the network . 
INTERFERENCE IN TELECOMS LINKED TO NETWORK ----------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) While the confrontation over the [ORG FiOS  ] system was taking place with [ORG Hizballah  ] , mobile telecommunications were being subject to interference by [LOC Syria  ] in the north , [LOC Israel  ] in the south and possibly by the [ORG UN  ] at sea , according to [PER Hamadeh  ] . 
The information about [MISC Israeli  ] interference was passed &unofficially8 by [ORG UNIFIL  ] , since , in a recurring complaint by [PER Hamadeh  ] during the conversation , the [ORG LAF  ] has not reported any problems officially . 
The [MISC Syrian  ] interference is similar to that occurring during the [ORG Nahr  ] al-Barid fighting , and highlights the ability of the [MISC Syrians  ] to communicate within [LOC Lebanon  ] through non-Lebanese mobile systems . 
Because the system in the part of [LOC Syria  ] bordering on northern [LOC Lebanon  ] is a private company , [ORG MTM  ] , [PER Hamadeh  ] believes that they offer political cover to the [MISC Syrian  ] government , who he nevertheless believes is behind the problem . 
[PER Hamadeh  ] views these events as part of the same strategic interference in [LOC Lebanon  ] , both internally and externally . 
[PER Hamadeh  ] has a map that delineates [LOC BEIRUT  ] 00000523 002 OF 004 the interference , in an arc that runs from the north to the south of [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
MARCH 14 NEEDS TO MEET , BUT SAAD SHOULD BE THERE ------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Hamadeh  ] said that he , the Prime Minister and Minister of Defense [PER Elias Murr  ] are all danger , but he and [PER Murr  ] will take the biggest risk in exposing the [ORG Hizballah  ] [ORG FiOS  ] network . 
[PER Hamadeh  ] told the PM that he could not assume the risk alone for a showdown with [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
He also used the risk of physical harm as a deterrent with [PER Jumblatt  ] , who wanted to hold a press conference to expose the [ORG Hizballah  ] system . 
[PER Hamadeh  ] believes that this is a March 14 issue , and cannot be resolved without the participation of [PER Saad Hariri  ] . 
[PER Hamadeh  ] complained that there has not yet been either a March 14 meeting or a cabinet meeting to discuss this matter . 
He says he asked for such discussions in a meeting with PM Siniora April 15 , and will raise it again when they meet April 16 . 
[PER Hamadeh  ] also discussed the issue with [PER Larsen  ] , whom he met with recently in [LOC Paris  ] , although he did not give [PER Larsen  ] the map . 
If the [ORG GOL  ] decides to raise the issue with the [ORG United Nations Security Council  ] ( [ORG UNSC  ] ) he will then provide the map , said [PER Hamadeh  ] . 
[ORG HIZBALLAH  ] RESPONSE - DON’T TOUCH ! -------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Hamadeh  ] reported that [ORG LAF G-2 Brigadier General  ] [PER Georges Khoury  ] and [ORG ISF Major General  ] [PER Ashraf Rifi  ] saw [PER Wafiq Safa  ] , the [ORG Hizballah  ] liaison to the [MISC Lebanese  ] intelligence services , together . 
[PER Khoury  ] asked [PER Safa  ] to take down two parts of the network as a first step ; [PER Safa  ] refused . 
[PER Safa  ] stated that the network is part of Hizballah’s ability to defend [LOC Lebanon  ] , and that [ORG Hizballah  ] would regard any attack on the network as an act of aggression . 
However , PM [PER Siniora  ] only got a written report from [PER Khoury  ] ten days after the meeting , [PER Hamadeh  ] complained . 
Even then , the report was unsigned and thus returned to [PER Khoury  ] for signature . 
According to their report , [ORG Hizballah  ] argued that the PM , [PER Hamadeh  ] and [PER Murr  ] are only raising the issue of the [ORG FiOS  ] system in order to bring up the issue of [ORG Hizballah  ] weapons . 
[PER Safa  ] stated categorically that the [ORG FiOS  ] system is not up for discussion because it is a key part of the [ORG Hizballah  ] arsenal . 
[PER Safa  ] freely acknowledged to [PER Rifi  ] and [PER Khoury  ] that the network exists . 
It could only be discussed as part of a defense strategy , he said , adding that the network has no commercial or trade implications . 
He maintained that it does not penetrate the [MISC Christian  ] areas . 
[ORG HIZBALLAH  ] ASSERTIONS UNTRUE ----------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Hamadeh  ] believes both [ORG Hizballah  ] assertions to be untrue . 
He refutes the [ORG Hizballah  ] claim that the system exists solely to give them defensive communications throughout the country , saying that there are &centrales8 or hubs in many villages along the route , and no doubt these have lines running off to other villages and residences . 
He also believes that [ORG Hizballah  ] crews are only waiting for the snows in the [MISC Christian  ] regions of [MISC Metn  ] and [MISC Kswaran  ] to melt before completing penetration of these regions from the east . 
WORK DONE UNDER VARIOUS FORMS OF COVER ----------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) To complete the installations and at the same time stay below the radar , [PER Hamadeh  ] says that [ORG Hizballah  ] has used the municipalities to issue local permits . 
For example , in [LOC Sidon  ] they are working under the cover provided by [PER Abdel Rahman Bizri  ] , the mayor . 
In another case the [ORG Ministry of Energy  ] issued a permit for work that was &to reinforce energy lines , 8 although [PER Hamadeh  ] says that was clearly not true . 
[PER Hamadeh  ] says that the whole of the [LOC Bekaa  ] valley was done with local permits , and installations were done by different groups , each unaware of what the others were doing . 
However , he also says that some of the work was done with the knowledge of resigned Minister of [ORG Energy Fneish  ] , a [ORG Hizballah  ] member . 
DISCOVERY AND REPORT -------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The first official report was from the region of [LOC BEIRUT  ] 00000523 003 OF 004 Chouifat , which reported installation of an unknown fiber optic system , and asked the Minister of the Interior to stop it . 
No one did anything because , in Hamadeh’s opinion , they &had no guts.8 At the time of the earlier exposure of the [ORG Hizballah  ] telephone lines running through [LOC Beirut  ] , and even along the wall of the [MISC French  ] embassy , the [ORG GOL  ] asked [ORG Hizballah  ] to remove those lines , which [ORG Hizballah  ] did , and [PER Hamadeh  ] said that he believed at the time that would be the end of the network in the south . 
The full [ORG Ministry of Telecommunications  ] report on the system was compiled by engineers in the ministry and othersXXXXXXXXXXXX who [PER Hamadeh  ] believes could be in great danger because of the report . 
Once again [PER Hamadeh  ] pointed out that there were no official reports yet from [ORG ISF Major General Rifi  ] or [ORG LAF G-2 Brigadier General Khoury  ] . 
FUNDING FROM [LOC IRAN  ] ----------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The current installations , as per the map [PER Hamadeh  ] has given us , shows lines running from [LOC Beirut  ] , around both sides of the airport , into the south below the [LOC Litani  ] and back up through the [LOC Bekaa  ] valley to the far north . 
It covers the [MISC Palestinian  ] camps , and the [ORG Hizballah  ] training camps in the [LOC Bekaa  ] , and is penetrating deep into the [MISC Christian  ] [LOC Metn  ] and [LOC Ksarwan  ] areas . 
Although [PER Hamadeh  ] says he has &a few names , 8 he did not list the companies who are responsible for the installation , but said that information would be made available shortly . 
He cited the [MISC Iranian  ] Fund for the Reconstruction of [LOC Lebanon  ] as the source of the funding . 
This same group has been rebuilding roads and bridges since the July 2006 war with [LOC Israel  ] , and has been accused before of installing telecommunications lines in parallel with new roads . 
[PER Hamadeh  ] said that he wants to get the list of companies involved and black list them with the [ORG GOL  ] . 
STRATEGIC VICTORY ----------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Hamadeh  ] highlights the system as a strategic victory for [LOC Iran  ] , since it creates an important [MISC Iranian  ] outpost in [LOC Lebanon  ] , bypassing [LOC Syria  ] . 
He sees the value for the [MISC Iranians  ] as strategic , rather than technical or economic . 
The value for [ORG Hizballah  ] is the final step in creating a nation state . 
[ORG Hizballah  ] now has an army and weapons ; a television station ; an education system ; hospitals ; social services ; a financial system ; and a telecommunications system . 
As a sign of its confidence [ORG Hizballah  ] official [PER Safa  ] told [PER Khoury  ] and [PER Rifi  ] that any move against the [ORG FiOS  ] system would be taken as &an [MISC Israeli  ] attack8 and dealt with accordingly . 
When [PER Khoury  ] and [PER Rifi  ] pointed out that the people in the area might not accept this and might show hostility to [ORG Hizballah  ] in this case , [PER Safa  ] replied , &We don’t care ; we will accept hostile reactions.8 At that point , according to [PER Hamadeh  ] , the [ORG GOL  ] decided it needed to inform its friends and make a decision on the next steps to be taken . 
[PER HAMADEH  ] PREPARES INTERNAL CAMPAIGN ----------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Meanwhile , [PER Hamadeh  ] is preparing a &very strong8 internal campaign . 
This campaign , he said , has the potential to &destroy8 [PER Aoun  ] and mobilize [MISC Christians  ] , as well as influence those [ORG Shia  ] who are already beginning to worry about [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
He is waiting for a March 14 meeting to discuss this campaign . 
[PER Saad  ] has apparently traveled to [LOC London  ] and [LOC Geneva  ] this week , and is expected to be back in [LOC Riyadh  ] by 4/20 . 
[PER Saad  ] has been out of [LOC Lebanon  ] for some several weeks and it is not known when he will return . 
[PER Hamadeh  ] sees only two choices for the [MISC GOL:  ] approach the [ORG UN Security Council  ] directly , or take on [ORG Hizballah  ] by cutting lines . 
But do the [MISC Lebanese  ] security forces have the “guts” for that , or are they frightened by [MISC Safa’s  ] statement that those actions would be considered an act of aggression , he wonders. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: Last year , when Hamadeh’s telecommunications ministry “discovered” the well-known [ORG Hizballah  ] telephone system , including the line strung along the wall of the [MISC French  ] embassy , he maintained that the [ORG GOL  ] would not tolerate the erosion of its “last monopoly” by [ORG Hizballah  ] , However , aside from the ceremonial cutting of the [MISC French  ] embassy line , there was no further action . 
This time around , it appears that by sharing as widely as possible the details of the plan , the [ORG GOL  ] may hope that someone else will take on the challenge . 
End cmment .
