THE HAGUE 0092 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Fay Hartog Levin  ] for reasons 1.4 ( B , D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) This cable continues reporting on post 's efforts to get the [MISC Dutch  ] to " " yes " " on a post-2010 deployment in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( reftels ) . <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG SUMMARY: Labor Party  ] leader [PER Bos  ] told the Ambassador in confidence ( [ORG STRICTLY PROTECT  ] ) the [MISC Dutch  ] will likely stay in [LOC Afghanistan  ] post-2010 but not in [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
The cabinet will probably not take that decision until the end of the year . 
Post recommends next steps in our engagement ( para 7 ) . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) At the end of her August 24 courtesy call , Ambassador talked one-on-one with [PER Wouter Bos  ] , the [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) leader , Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister , about [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
( COMMENT: Senior [MISC Dutch  ] officials had identified the [ORG Labor Party  ] and [PER Bos  ] , in particular , as the most reluctant member of the three-party governing coalition to agree on staying in [LOC Afghanistan  ] beyond the current 2010 mandate . 
END COMMENT . 
) [PER Bos  ] told the Ambassador in confidence the issue of staying in [LOC Afghanistan  ] was politically unpopular , especially within his own party . 
" " The [MISC Dutch  ] have gone as far as they can go . 
" " Two years ago , when the [MISC Dutch  ] decided to extend the mission in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , everyone agreed that would be the last time . 
If we now extend again , [PER Bos  ] said , we will be asked every two years to stay on . 
It is important to stick to our word and wrap up the mission . 
This , [PER Bos  ] argued , was the official [ORG Labor Party  ] position. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Bos  ] then said the Government , with [ORG Labor Party  ] support , will be able to stay in [LOC Afghanistan  ] after its current mandate expires , but not in [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
The Ambassador pressed [PER Bos  ] that it was more logical for the [MISC Dutch  ] to remain in [LOC Uruzgan  ] where they had developed important contacts with local tribes and leaders as well as funded numerous projects . 
[PER Bos  ] admitted this was true , but did not know if staying in [LOC Uruzgan  ] would fly with his party. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The Ambassador mentioned the [ORG Embassy  ] would be hosting a number of senior [ORG USG  ] officials in the near future who would be willing to discuss [LOC Afghanistan  ] with [PER Bos  ] ( such as USNATO Amb . 
[PER Daalder  ] and CENTCOM Gen. Petreaus ) . 
He said [ORG Development Cooperation Minister  ] [PER Koenders  ] was advising him on all issues involving [LOC Afghanistan  ] , including how to handle it politically . 
If [PER Bos  ] is not available to meet with [LOC U.S.  ] visitors , he will make sure [PER Koenders  ] is . 
He also advised the Ambassador the [ORG Cabinet  ] would probably not make a final decision on the deployment question until the end of the year , December. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) COMMENT: Queen [PER Beatrix  ] commented to the Ambassador during her credentialing ceremony on August 19 that finding a way forward on [LOC Afghanistan  ] " " would be difficult , " " but must be done . 
It appears the senior leadership of the body politic agrees . 
We had heard from other [ORG Cabinet  ] members , including Foreign Minister [PER Verhagen  ] , that [PER Bos  ] and the [ORG Labor Party  ] would likely agree to extending the [MISC Dutch  ] mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] past 2010 . 
[PER Bos  ] 's statement , however , was the first time any senior [ORG Labor Party  ] leader had made that clear . 
Although appearing to draw a line in the sand about leaving [LOC Uruzgan  ] , Qappearing to draw a line in the sand about leaving [LOC Uruzgan  ] , [PER Bos  ] did not seem categorical about that issue . 
In our engagement , we need to continue to stress the Alliance need for the [MISC Dutch  ] to remain in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , in particular ; the progress the [MISC Dutch  ] have made in [LOC Uruzgan  ] and the need to build upon their stability and development efforts there ; the increased [LOC U.S.  ] contribution in military and civilian personnel and resources in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ; and the enhanced contributions of [ORG NATO  ] and other partners . 
A word of caution - the [MISC Dutch  ] are concerned [PER Jan Mohammed  ] , the former governor and local warlord , might be re-appointed governor of [LOC Uruzgan  ] if Pres . 
[PER Karzai  ] is re-elected . 
If that were to happen , everyone , including our strongest supporters , says the [MISC Dutch  ] will not/not return to [LOC Uruzgan  ] under any circumstances . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) ENGAGEMENT PLAN: ( A ) The Ambassador continues her courtesy calls , seeing Foreign Minister [PER Verhagen  ] and Defense Minister van [ORG Middelkoop  ] August 31 . 
She will raise [LOC Afghanistan  ] and extending the [MISC Dutch  ] mandate in both meetings . 
She will also meet with parliamentary leaders in the near future . 
( B ) USNATO Amb . 
[PER Daalder  ] visits Sept. 3 and will have meetings with senior [ORG MoD  ] and [ORG MFA  ] officials .

We are working with his staff to identify opportunities for him to meet appropriate ministers and parliamentarians . 
( E ) We recommend SRAP Amb . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] call Minister [PER Koenders  ] , whom he met in late March in The [LOC Hague  ] , to thank him for the [MISC Dutch  ] support of the [MISC Afghan  ] elections ( 8 million [MISC Euros  ] contribution to [ORG UNDP  ] , long and short-term staffers to the [ORG EU  ] election observers mission , 30 military personnel ) , to discuss the recent Friends of [LOC Pakistan  ] conference in [LOC Istanbul  ] ( they pledged 86.7 million [MISC Euros  ] in assistance over three years at the [LOC Tokyo  ] conference ) and to talk about regional developments . 
Amb . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] could offer to visit the [LOC Netherlands  ] if [PER Koenders  ] thought it would be helpful . 
( F ) Finally , we will re-examine our engagement plan at the end of September in light of Gen. [PER McCrystal  ] 's strategic review and the results of these meetings .
