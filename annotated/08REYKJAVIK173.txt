( SBU ) In discussion of the current situation in [LOC Georgia  ] with Political Director [PER Greta Gunnarsdottir  ] , the highest available [ORG MFA  ] official , the Ambassador urged August 14 that [LOC Iceland  ] press [LOC Russia  ] to take the necessary steps detailed in reftel . 
[PER Gunnarsdottir  ] will raise the message with the Foreign Minister asap . 
In response to the Ambassador 's questions , [PER Gunnarsdottir  ] offered following observations: - Humanitarian aid: [LOC Iceland  ] was specifically asked for and will provide " very quickly " an information officer to work for [ORG UNICEF  ] in [LOC Georgia  ] . 
The government is considering other humanitarian contributions , but has as yet reached no specific decisions . 
Ambassador detailed [LOC U.S.  ] contributions and pressed for a speedy and positive decision to help meet the increasing humanitarian needs of the region. - [ORG NAC Meeting  ] August 19 in Brussels: Foreign Minister [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] will attend , accompanied by Amb . 
[PER Thorir Ibsen  ] , [ORG MFA  ] head of [ORG NATO  ] affairs. - [MISC Icelandic-Russian  ] contacts: [LOC Iceland  ] has not approached [LOC Russia  ] bilaterally on [LOC Georgia  ] developments , preferring to deal with the subject in multilateral fora . 
Ambassador made the case for direct bilateral engagement , noting that [LOC Iceland  ] does have an Embassy in [LOC Moscow  ] and that the [MISC Russian  ] ambassador in [LOC Reykjavik  ] has made intemperate and misleading remarks to the press concerning [LOC Georgia  ] 's leadership and regional intentions . 
( Note: We understand that the [ORG MFA  ] had considered but decided not to call in the [MISC Russian  ] ambassador . 
) <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador has requested a meeting with Permanent Secretary [PER Gretar Mar Sigurdsson  ] , [PER Gunnarsdottir  ] 's boss , on his return from leave next week to raise [LOC Iceland  ] 's uninspiring stance in the recent [ORG NAC  ] meetings on [LOC Georgia  ] . 
Although we suspect the GOI is trying to avoid irritating the [MISC Russians  ] in advance of the October vote on [LOC Iceland  ] 's bid for a [ORG UNSC  ] seat , we want to point out that stepping up in a necessary cause is the type of behavior the [LOC U.S.  ] looks for in a [ORG UNSC  ] member. van Voorst</pre></code>
