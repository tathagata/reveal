Patterson  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: [MISC Pakistani  ] officials do not appear to have coalesced on a strategy or position for the mid-January resumption of [MISC Conference on Disarmament  ] ( [MISC CD  ] ) discussions on the [ORG Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty  ] ( [ORG FMCT  ] ) . 
[ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) interlocutors continue to stress the need for consensus language to bring [LOC Pakistan  ] on board a [MISC CD  ] work program that includes [ORG FMCT  ] negotiations , while [ORG Strategic Plans Division  ] ( [ORG SPD  ] ) officials urge a cautious approach that leaves plenty of time for deliberations . 
In the absence of a formal decision , continued delay along procedural lines is the most likely default approach . 
Overt [LOC U.S.  ] pressure may solidify this tactic , according to a non-governmental contact who follows disarmament issues . 
The [MISC GOP  ] strongly desires the resumption of [MISC U.S.-Pakistan  ] talks on nonproliferation , security , and strategic stability before the next [MISC CD  ] session in order to discuss perspectives on the [ORG FMCT  ] and come to an “understanding” on each side’s positions . 
In order to take advantage of internal [MISC GOP  ] deliberations , Post recommends high-level interventions with [MISC Pakistan’s  ] military leadership to help build support for proceeding with [ORG FMCT  ] negotiations . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Over the last two weeks , PolOff canvassed [MISC GOP  ] officials in the [ORG Disarmament Division  ] at the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] ( Director General Dr. [PER Irfan Yusuf Shami  ] and Director [PER Kamran Akhtar  ] ) , the [ORG Arms Control and Disarmament Directorate  ] at the [ORG Strategic Plans Division  ] ( Director [PER Khalid Banuri  ] and Deputy Director [PER Adil Sultan  ] ) , as well as one non-governmental contact ( [PER Maria Sultan  ] of the [LOC South Asia Strategic Stability Institute  ] ( [ORG SASSI  ] ) ) who follows nonproliferation issues , for views on [MISC Pakistan’s  ] likely approach to [ORG Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty  ] discussions at the [MISC Conference on Disarmament  ] when the 2010 session convenes in January . 
The discussions with [MISC Pakistani  ] interlocutors suggest that [MISC Pakistan’s  ] [ORG FMCT  ] position remains somewhat malleable and that [MISC GOP  ] officials have not yet coalesced on a specific position for the next [MISC CD  ] session . 
They also underscored the importance of bilateral discussions , particularly with high-level [LOC Pakistan  ] military officials , if the USG is to secure [MISC Pakistani  ] support for beginning [MISC CD  ] negotiations. ------------------------ [ORG Strategic Considerations  ] ------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) According to [MISC Pakistani  ] counterparts , [MISC Pakistan’s  ] [ORG FMCT  ] position is shaped by four strategic considerations , which point to a degrading of the deterrent value of [MISC Pakistan’s  ] nuclear weapons and thus make an [ORG FMCT  ] difficult for [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
First , [MISC Pakistani  ] officials perceive the [LOC U.S.-India  ] civil nuclear cooperation initiative as having unshackled [MISC India’s  ] nuclear weapons program . 
Prior to the initiative , they said , [LOC India  ] faced a significant uranium supply constraint that forced it to choose literally between nuclear weapons or nuclear power . 
Now , however , [LOC India  ] is able to secure foreign-supplied uranium for its civil nuclear power reactors , leaving it free to devote a greater share of its domestically-sourced uranium to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons . 
This perceived growth in nuclear weapons production capability blunts any numerical advantage in nuclear weapons [LOC Pakistan  ] may have. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Second , the increase in high-technology defense and space trade between [LOC India  ] and the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , and others has improved the quality of [MISC India’s  ] nuclear systems , according to [MISC Pakistani  ] thinking . 
While [LOC Pakistan  ] continues to face significant trade barriers and is subject to export denial regimes , [MISC Pakistani  ] officials believe [LOC India  ] is no longer held back by these constraints and is using market access to improve its nuclear delivery vehicles. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Third , [MISC India’s  ] growing conventional military superiority , coupled with its [MISC Cold Start  ] military doctrine of fast mobilization and rapid strike capability , poses a new level of threat , according to [MISC Pakistani  ] counterparts . 
[MISC Indian  ] plans and capabilities have forced [LOC Pakistan  ] to rely more on nuclear weapons and less on conventional military capability to balance [MISC Indian  ] force . 
[PER Maria Sultan  ] of [ORG SASSI  ] suggested that [MISC Pakistani  ] military planners now focus on the possibility of a two-front war and believe that [LOC Pakistan  ] needs to transform its arsenal to smaller , tactical weapons that could be used on the battlefield against [MISC Indian  ] conventional capabilities . 
The result of this trend is the need for greater stocks of fissile material to feed [MISC Pakistan’s  ] nuclear weapons requirement. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Finally , [MISC Pakistani  ] counterparts point to [MISC India’s  ] interest and investment in missile defense , even if it will take many years to field a capable system . 
They believe this indicates that [LOC India  ] is not interested in a balance of power , but intends to degrade the value of [MISC Pakistan’s  ] nuclear deterrent. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Taken together , these strategic considerations point [LOC Pakistan  ] in the direction of a larger nuclear force that requires a greater amount of fissile material , [MISC Pakistani  ] officials argue . 
By this logic , agreeing to a production cutoff now does not meet [MISC Pakistan’s  ] interests . 
It is unclear whether [MISC GOP  ] officials believe [LOC Pakistan  ] is ahead of [LOC India  ] in terms of nuclear capability , but they point to the combination of [MISC India’s  ] capabilities and intentions , as well as its stockpile of fissile material ( even if spent nuclear reactor fuel is not as useful in nuclear weapons ) , to suggest that there is little advantage for [LOC Pakistan  ] in trying to lock [LOC India  ] into an [ORG FMCT  ] now , since both countries’ arsenals appear set to grow . 
[PER Maria Sultan  ] suggested that this is not the consensus view , however , and that at least some part of the [MISC Pakistani  ] military establishment believes it better to agree to an [ORG FMCT  ] now since [LOC India  ] has a much greater long-term fissile material growth potential than [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
In either case , the argument that the [ORG FMCT  ] is a global disarmament imperative seems to have no currency in [LOC Islamabad  ] ; [MISC Pakistan’s  ] position , as described by [MISC Pakistani  ] counterparts , is shaped exclusively by its own regional concerns. ------------------ [ORG FMCT Policy Circle  ] ------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) While [MISC GOP  ] officials would not comment directly on internal [ORG FMCT  ] policy deliberations over the summer , [PER Maria Sultan  ] argued that [MISC Pakistan’s  ] surprising reversal at the [MISC CD  ] can be chalked up to two factors: a [MISC CD  ] Ambassador too eager to join consensus and a lethargic policy process driven more by personalities than institutions . 
By her account , [MISC Pakistan’s  ] initial support of the [MISC CD  ] work program in the spring of 2009 was a decision made by Ambassador [PER Zamir Akram  ] without the benefit of a full policy review in [LOC Islamabad  ] . 
[PER Akram  ] , she suggested , is part of the old guard of [ORG MFA  ] ideologues and a long-time supporter of the [ORG Shannon  ] mandate , which identified parameters for international consensus on an [ORG FMCT  ] . 
However , [MISC Pakistan’s  ] position to support [ORG FMCT  ] negotiations based on the [ORG Shannon  ] mandate was outdated , she said . 
The advent of the [LOC U.S.-India  ] civil nuclear initiative , in particular , had changed the terms for [LOC Islamabad  ] , but its [MISC CD  ] strategy had never been updated . 
Military officials in [LOC Islamabad  ] intervened , she stated , and it was left to [ORG MFA  ] to extricate [LOC Pakistan  ] from a dilemma of its own creation , which is why [LOC Pakistan  ] sought to tie up the [MISC CD  ] on procedural grounds. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) According to [PER Sultan  ] , there are several camps within the [MISC GOP  ] policy circle on [ORG FMCT  ] . 
[ORG MFA  ] officials , she said , tend toward continuing to support negotiation of an [ORG FMCT  ] . 
In addition to Foreign Secretary Bashir and [PER Irfan Shami  ] , other officials , such as [ORG MFA  ] spokesman [PER Abdul Basit  ] and Ambassador to [LOC Beijing  ] [PER Masood Khan  ] , are [PER Akram  ] protgs and will continue to be consulted on negotiating strategy even though they are not directly tied to the [ORG Disarmament Division  ] , she suggested . 
While important , [ORG MFA  ] officials probably are not the most influential voices on [ORG FMCT  ] , she argued ; the views of high-level military officials , in particular [PER Gen. Kayani  ] and [ORG SPD Director General  ] [PER Khalid Kidwai  ] , carry more weight within this circle . 
[PER Kayani  ] , she indicated , is aware of the issue but is not prepared to make a decision . 
[PER Kidwai  ] , on the other hand , favors delaying negotiations as long as possible , presumably to leave time and space for the investments made in expanding [MISC Pakistan’s  ] fissile material production capacity to bear fruit . 
[ORG SPD Arms Control Director  ] [PER Khalid Banuri  ] indicated this preference for delay , telling [MISC PolOff  ] that the current momentum on [ORG FMCT  ] should not be used to rush the process and “there needs to be plenty of time for deliberations.” <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Sultan  ] argued , however , that [PER Kidwai  ] does not monopolize the debate on this issue and that other critical inputs come from the [ORG Strategic Forces Command  ] , the Director General for Military Operations ( [ORG DGMO  ] ) , the Minister of Defense , and some [ORG National Defense University  ] experts . 
In particular , she stated , “the [ORG DGMO  ] ( Maj. [PER Gen. Javed Iqbal  ] ) takes a view on the [ORG FMCT  ] 180 degrees apart from [MISC Kidwai’s  ] , ” believing that it is better to bind [LOC India  ] to current fissile material levels than wait for the full effect of the [LOC U.S.-India  ] nuclear initiative , which will allow [LOC India  ] to produce even greater amounts of plutonium. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) When asked how she rated overall government support for these two positions , [PER Sultan  ] assessed 70% favor further delay while 30% support negotiation . 
However , she cautioned , overt [LOC U.S.  ] pressure on [LOC Pakistan  ] will firmly tip the balance toward delay . 
To bring [LOC Pakistan  ] on board , she said the [LOC U.S.  ] needs to focus on addressing [MISC Pakistan’s  ] strategic concerns and the slow degradation of deterrence . 
In particular , she argued for opening the high-technology defense market for [LOC Pakistan  ] on early warning capabilities , such as the [MISC AWACS  ] platform. ------------------------------------- Next Steps and [ORG Post’s Recommendations  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Looking ahead to January , [ORG MFA Disarmament Director General  ] [PER Irfan Shami  ] expressed a strong desire to resume bilateral talks on nonproliferation , security , and strategic stability before the [MISC CD  ] session in order to discuss perspectives on the [ORG FMCT  ] and come to an “understanding” on each other’s positions . 
He would not elaborate on what that “understanding” might constitute , but stated [LOC Pakistan  ] needs time to explain its position . 
While it is unlikely such discussions will turn [MISC Pakistan’s  ] policy around , they should have the effect of forcing more internal discussions on the issue , which provides some opportunity for USG influence. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) It seems clear that , beyond [ORG MFA  ] , [MISC Pakistan’s  ] military leadership is a crucial audience . 
While direct [LOC U.S.  ] pressure is unlikely to convince them to support [ORG FMCT  ] negotiations , and may even hurt efforts to move forward , mil-mil discussions on [MISC Pakistan’s  ] strategic concerns , particularly with [ORG COAS General  ] [PER Kayani  ] and [ORG DGMO Major General  ] [PER Javed Iqbal  ] , could help build the military’s confidence that [MISC Pakistan’s  ] interests will be taken into account . 
As part of these interventions , it may help to provide [MISC Pakistani  ] military leaders with an analytical case for why an [ORG FMCT  ] makes more sense for [LOC Pakistan  ] now than in the future in terms of the strength of the its deterrence vis-a-vis [LOC India  ] .
