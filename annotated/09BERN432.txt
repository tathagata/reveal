<code><pre>S E C R E T [ORG BERN  ] 000432 SIPDIS FOR THE SECRETARY FROM AMBASSADOR BEYER EO 12958 DECL: 10/08/2019 TAGS PREL , OVIP , SZ SUBJECT: SCENESETTER: YOUR OCTOBER 10 VISIT TO [ORG ZURICH Classified  ] By: Ambassador [PER Donald S. Beyer  ] ; reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) I and the rest of the [ORG Embassy Bern  ] team are looking forward to your visit with great anticipation in what promises to be a landmark event in [MISC Armenian-Turkish  ] relations with lasting benefits for [MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] security . 
Foreign Minister [PER Calmy-Rey  ] is riding high on a series of foreign policy successes , from the [MISC Swiss  ] government’s agreement with [ORG DOJ  ] in the [ORG UBS  ] matter , to [MISC Switzerland’s  ] hosting of the October 1 P5 1 talks with [LOC Iran  ] in [LOC Geneva  ] , to the upcoming October 10 signing ceremony in [LOC Zurich  ] to chart a path for normalization of relations between [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Armenia.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) While [PER Calmy-Rey  ] has reasons to celebrate , her foreign policy activism is not universally appreciated across the domestic political spectrum in [LOC Switzerland  ] . 
[MISC Swiss  ] views are colored by [MISC Switzerland’s  ] centuries-old tradition of neutrality . 
Issues that draw on the [MISC Swiss  ] capacity for facilitation and mediation , such as [MISC Turkish-Armenian  ] rapprochement , generally enjoy strong public support . 
On the other hand , foreign policy activism with a more partisan or “hard” security flavor , such as Calmy-Rey’s vociferous support for [LOC Kosovo  ] independence , or her recent all out -- but ultimately unsuccessful -- effort to obtain a parliamentary mandate for [MISC Swiss  ] military participation in the [ORG EU  ] anti-piracy operation [ORG Atalanta  ] , do not enjoy the same broad public support . 
The recent arrest at the [LOC Zurich  ] airport of film director [PER Roman Polanski  ] was viewed by [PER Calmy-Rey  ] as putting a dent in [MISC Switzerland’s  ] international image . 
Nevertheless , she has limited her criticism to remarking that the arrest lacked “finesse , ” and surely is aware that [MISC Swiss  ] public opinion favors Polanski’s extradition to the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) Probably the biggest challenge on [MISC Switzerland’s  ] foreign policy front is its continuing crisis with [LOC Libya  ] , following the July 2008 arrest of [PER Muammar Gaddafi’s  ] son [PER Hannibal Gaddafi  ] in [LOC Geneva  ] for allegedly brutally abusing his domestic staff . 
[MISC Swiss  ] President [PER Merz’s  ] ill-fated visit to [LOC Tripoli  ] in late August , during which he publicly apologized for what by all accounts was a justified police action , thus far has failed to win the freedom of two [MISC Swiss  ] businessmen that the [MISC Libyan  ] government has refused to allow to leave [LOC Libya  ] for over a year . 
The two [MISC Swiss  ] citizens are being refused departure purportedly because of visa irregularities , but it is clear to all that [LOC Tripoli  ] views them as a bargaining chip in extracting maximum concessions from the [MISC Swiss  ] . 
Moreover , after living under house arrest for the past year , the two businessmen recently were taken by [MISC Libyan  ] officials to an undisclosed location , further raising concern in [LOC Bern  ] about their fate . 
[PER Calmy-Rey  ] has asked for [ORG USG  ] assistance in pressing the [MISC Libyans  ] to allow the two [MISC Swiss  ] to return to [LOC Switzerland  ] . 
I strongly believe it is in our interest to do what we can , given [MISC Switzerland’s  ] many efforts to assist [LOC U.S.  ] citizens in [LOC Iran  ] , including , most recently , the cases of the three hikers and the release earlier this year of [PER Roxana Saberi.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Finally , [PER Calmy-Rey  ] has been very active is urging the [MISC Swiss  ] government to accept for resettlement in [LOC Switzerland  ] several [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainees who are slated for release . 
This idea is not at all popular with the [MISC Swiss  ] public , but [PER Calmy-Rey  ] views it as a consequent gesture against the backdrop of the [MISC Swiss  ] government’s past criticisms of [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
A [MISC Swiss  ] team visited [LOC Guantanamo  ] in August to interview four detainees , and is looking seriously at accepting an [MISC Uzbek  ] and two [MISC Uighurs  ] . 
The [MISC Swiss  ] government , however , is concerned that agreeing to accept [MISC Uighurs  ] would buy too much trouble with [LOC China  ] at a time when [LOC Switzerland  ] is seeking to conclude a trade agreement with [LOC Beijing  ] . 
Personal encouragement from you to [PER Calmy-Rey  ] underlining how much the [ORG USG  ] would appreciate [LOC Switzerland  ] accepting [MISC Uighurs  ] would be particularly timely while you are in [LOC Zurich.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Minimize considered .
