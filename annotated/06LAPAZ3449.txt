End Summary. ---------- Background ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) At a December 18 ceremony in the [LOC Chapare President  ] [PER Morales  ] unveiled the [ORG GOB  ] 's 2007 counter narcotics strategy . 
The cornerstone of the strategy is the [ORG GOB  ] 's " commitment to containing " coca cultivation at 20,000 hectares , an increase from the 12,000 allowed under [MISC Bolivian  ] law . 
[PER Morales  ] also committed to improving drug consumption prevention programs , strengthening interdiction , promoting the industrialization of coca products , and changing international conventions to decriminalize coca leaf. ---------------------------------------- [ORG United Nations  ] & [ORG European Union Position  ] ---------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG United Nations  ] and [ORG European Union  ] representatives admitted that their respective organ- izations lacked a clearly defined response to the [ORG GOB  ] 's announced plan . 
Mr. [PER Martinez  ] opened with the point , and all parties agreed , that the [ORG GOB  ] 's plan was a violation of both international conventions ( 1961 [ORG Single Convention  ] on [ORG Narcotic Drugs  ] ) and [LOC Bolivia  ] 's own narcotics law ( known as law 1008 ) . 
Ambassador [PER Standley  ] said that [ORG EU  ] member countries were all concerned with the [ORG GOB  ] 's plan and that they preferred a discreet response rather than a public rebuke . 
[PER Standley  ] stated his personal opinion that the [ORG GOB  ] will never find widespread legal ( industrial ) uses for [LOC Bolivia  ] 's excess coca . 
Mr. [PER Standley  ] noted that the [ORG GOB  ] continues to stall [ORG EU  ] efforts to perform a study on the size of [LOC Bolivia  ] 's licit coca market . 
He mentioned that he recently met with [PER Pablo Solon  ] , [LOC Bolivia  ] 's Ambassador at large for integration and trade issues , who assured him the [ORG GOB  ] was still interested in the study and that it would move forward on it in January . 
[PER Standley  ] was most interested in hearing how the [LOC United States  ] was planning to respond to the [ORG GOB  ] 's plan and how it would impact [LOC Bolivia  ] 's narcotics certification in March 2007. ---------------- [ORG DCM  ] Urs' Remarks ---------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [ORG DCM  ] explained that Embassy [LOC La Paz  ] had been warned that the [ORG GOB  ] was planning a change in licit coca growing targets and that the Ambassador had expressed the [ORG USG  ] 's concern over the [ORG GOB  ] 's plan prior to its announcement . 
The [ORG DCM  ] concurred that strong public denunciations of the [ORG GOB  ] 's plan would be counter- productive . 
The [ORG DCM  ] explained that the [ORG USG  ] was prepared to sign its annual letter of agreement with the [ORG GOB  ] on counter narcotics that same day and would not abandon its anti-drug efforts at this time . 
However , he emphasized that [ORG USG  ] officials will state both privately and publicly that that the [ORG GOB  ] 's new strategy is a step backwards and seems to violate international commitments. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG DCM  ] explained that [LOC White House  ] review of [MISC Bolivian  ] counter-narcotic efforts in March rested on a number of factors but that the [ORG GOB  ] 's 2007 strategy if implemented would seriously complicate the review . 
He explained that the [ORG USG  ] position would push for [LOC Bolivia  ] to move forward on the [ORG EU  ] 's proposed coca study . 
In response to this potential requirement , Mr. [PER Martinez  ] observed , with a hint of sarcasm , that the [ORG GOB  ] was likely to announce its plan to begin the study on February 28 , <a id='par2007' href='#par2007'>¶</a>2007. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG DCM  ] repeatedly stressed the need for the international community to have a united and clear response to the [ORG GOB  ] 's new plan . 
The [ORG DCM  ] suggested that a mini- [LOC Dublin  ] group meeting be convened to develop a common position . 
Ambassador [PER Standley  ] and Mr. [PER Martinez  ] concurred with the [ORG DCM  ] 's suggestions , and the three agreed that January 8 or 9 would be a suitable date for the meeting .
