End summary . 
[ORG USG  ] CONCERNS ABOUT POSSIBLE STRIKES ON CIVILIAN TARGETS --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) Ambassador [PER Smith  ] delivered points in reftel to [PER Prince Khaled  ] on February 6 , 2010 . 
The Ambassador highlighted [ORG USG  ] concerns about providing [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] with satellite imagery of the [LOC Yemen  ] border area absent greater certainty that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] was and would remain fully in compliance with the laws of armed conflict during the conduct of military operations , particularly regarding attacks on civilian targets . 
The Ambassador noted the [ORG USG  ] 's specific concern about an apparent [MISC Saudi  ] air strike on a building that the [LOC U.S.  ] believed to be a [MISC Yemeni  ] medical clinic . 
The Ambassador showed [PER Prince Khaled  ] a satellite image of the bomb-damaged building in question . 
IF WE HAD THE PREDATOR , THIS MIGHT NOT HAVE HAPPENED --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) Upon seeing the photograph , [PER Prince Khalid  ] remarked , " This looks familiar , " and added , " if we had the Predator , maybe we would not have this problem . 
" He noted that [MISC Saudi  ] [ORG Air Force  ] operations were necessarily being conducted without the desired degree of precision , and recalled that a clinic had been struck , based on information received from [LOC Yemen  ] that it was being used as an operational base by the [LOC Houthis  ] . 
[PER Prince Khalid  ] explained the [MISC Saudi  ] approach to its fight with the [LOC Houthis  ] , emphasizing that the [MISC Saudis  ] had to hit the [LOC Houthis  ] very hard in order to " bring them to their knees " and compel them to come to terms with the [MISC Yemeni  ] government . 
" However , " he said , " we tried very hard not to hit civilian targets . 
" The [MISC Saudis  ] had 130 deaths and the [MISC Yemenis  ] lost as many as one thousand . 
" Obviously , " [PER Prince Khaled  ] observed , " some civilians died , though we wish that this did not happen . 
" HOW THE TARGETS WERE SELECTED ----------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [PER Prince Khaled  ] gave the Ambassador further background , explaining that the targets given to the [MISC Saudi  ] [ORG Air Force  ] were studied and recommended by a [MISC Saudi-Yemeni  ] joint committee headed by [MISC Saudi  ] and [MISC Yemeni  ] general officers . 
That joint committee reported to him , and no targets were struck unless they had clearance from this joint committee . 
" Did they make mistakes ? 
Possibly . 
" [PER Prince Khaled  ] also reported that the [MISC Saudis  ] had problems with some of the targeting recommendations received from the [MISC Yemeni  ] side . 
For instance , there was one occasion when [MISC Saudi  ] pilots aborted a strike , when they sensed something was wrong about the information they received from the [MISC Yemenis  ] . 
It turned out that the site recommended to be hit was the headquarters of General [PER Ali Mohsen Al-Ahmar  ] , the [MISC Yemeni  ] northern area military commander , who is regarded as a political opponent to President [PER Saleh  ] . 
This incident prompted the [MISC Saudis  ] to be more cautious about targeting recommendations from the [MISC Yemeni  ] government . 
CEASEFIRE COMING SOON --------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The Ambassador told [PER Prince Khaled  ] that the [ORG USG  ] is looking to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] to help bring an end to the [MISC Houthi  ] fighting soon . 
[PER Prince Khaled  ] responded that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] is " looking for ways to end this conflict in a way that fosters good relations . 
" He said that he met with President [PER Saleh  ] last Wednesday to discuss [MISC Houthi  ] ceasefire terms , and they agreed that , so long as the [LOC Houthis  ] deliver on the terms they offered , there should be news about a ceasefire " within a week . 
" As part of the ceasefire arrangements the [MISC Yemeni  ] military will be deployed on the [MISC Yemeni  ] side of the border to prevent future [MISC Houthi  ] incursions into [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
" Then , " [PER Prince Khaled  ] noted , " we can concentrate on [ORG Al-Qaida  ] . 
" COMMENT ------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [PER Prince Khaled  ] , in addressing the Ambassador 's concerns about possible targeting of civilian sites appeared neither defensive nor evasive . 
He was unequivocal in his assurance that [MISC Saudi  ] military operations had been and would continue to be conducted with priority to avoiding civilian casualties . 
The Ambassador found this assurance credible , all the more so in light of [PER Prince Khaled  ] 's acknowledgment that mistakes likely happened during the strikes against [MISC Houthi  ] targets , of the inability of the [MISC Saudi  ] [ORG Air Force  ] to operate with adequate precision , and the unreliability of [MISC Yemeni  ] targeting recommendations . 
Based on these assurances , the Ambassador has approved , as authorized in reftel , the provision of [ORG USG  ] imagery of the [MISC Yemeni  ] border area to the [MISC Saudi  ] Government . 
While the fighting with the [LOC Houthis  ] appears to be drawing to a close , the imagery will be of continuing value to the [MISC Saudi  ] military to monitor and prevent [MISC Houthi  ] incursions across the border as well as enhancing [MISC Saudi  ] capabilities against [ORG Al-Qaeda  ] activities in this area .
