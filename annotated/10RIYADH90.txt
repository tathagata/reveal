Smith  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: During a 30-minute meeting with [PER Prince Mohammed  ] , General [PER Jones  ] reviewed [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Saudi  ] efforts to combat [ORG Al-Qaida  ] extremists in the region and discussed [MISC Afghanistan/Pakistan  ] , [LOC Yemen  ] , and [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Prince Mohammed  ] highlighted [MISC Saudi  ] Arabia’s continued and growing concerns about [ORG Al-Qaida  ] operations originating from [LOC Yemen  ] and praised the [MISC Yemeni  ] government’s successful December attacks against [ORG Al-Qaida  ] operatives . 
The meeting was followed by a lunch and a briefing on the situation on the [MISC Saudi-Yemeni  ] border . 
WE MUST KEEP [ORG AL-QAIDA  ] ON THE RUN -------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) General [PER Jones  ] noted that the attempted bombing of a [LOC U.S.  ] aircraft on December 25 is another reminder that we are passing through difficult times . 
He assured [PER Prince Mohammed  ] that while the [LOC U.S.  ] recognizes that screening procedures can be improved , the [LOC U.S.  ] has confidence that the systems in place are basically sound . 
The General also noted that terrorism concerns seem to be spreading beyond [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC Yemen  ] , and [LOC Somalia  ] , and now are being heard from governments in north [LOC Africa  ] , particularly [LOC Niger  ] , [LOC Mali  ] , [LOC Morocco  ] and [LOC Algeria.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Prince [PER Mohammed  ] responded that we are likely to see many more attempts like the December 25 incident . 
He also noted that the [MISC Saudi  ] experience against [ORG Al-Qaida  ] demonstrates that the best response is to “keep them on the run.” Right after the 9/11 attacks , he noted , nearly eighty percent of the mosques in [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] voiced support for [PER Bin Laden  ] . 
That is when the [MISC Saudi  ] leadership realized how dire the problem they faced was . 
Over the last 6 years of combating [ORG Al-Qaida  ] inside [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , the [ORG Kingdom  ] has foiled many [ORG Al-Qaida  ] plots and in the process learned that we must not only to fight [ORG Al-Qaida  ] “in the field , ” but also to counter their ideology in order to curtail recruitment. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) In this light , the recent attack against [ORG Al-Qaida  ] in [LOC Yemen  ] “was very positive.” [PER Prince Mohammed  ] noted that the [MISC Saudis  ] have been monitoring conversations of [ORG Al-Qaida  ] operatives in [LOC Yemen  ] very closely , and whereas before the attack they were hearing relaxed 20-minute phone conversations over cell phones , after the attack the phones went virtually silent . 
This suggests that at least for now these operatives are more focused on their own security rather than on planning operations . 
[MISC SAUDI  ] CONCERNS ON [LOC YEMEN  ] ----------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Prince [PER Mohammed  ] said that the [MISC Saudi  ] government has been watching with great concern [MISC Al-Qaida’s  ] growth in [LOC Yemen  ] over the last five years . 
Yemen’s geography makes it a much more convenient place for [ORG Al-Qaida  ] operations . 
Not only does the mountainous terrain help them hide , but the shoreline also gives them an ability to move over the water - extending their potential reach much further abroad. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) One of [MISC Al-Qaida’s  ] objectives in its confrontation with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , Prince [PER Mohammed  ] explained is “to control [LOC Mecca  ] and [ORG Medina.”  ] He said that they want to be able to control who makes the [MISC Hajj  ] , and if they were able to do so , they would limit the visits of those coming to the [MISC Hajj  ] to one week , something that could cause chaos . 
( Embassy note: Among [MISC Al-Qaida’s  ] basic objectives is its call to “liberate” the [MISC Islamic  ] holy sites from the corrupt hands of the [PER Al Saud  ] , but this is the first time we have heard a [MISC Saudi  ] official point out the more specific goal of limiting how long [MISC Muslims  ] can visit the holy places as part of their [MISC Hajj  ] . 
End note . 
) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Prince [PER Mohammed  ] also noted that [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] has been making an effort to seal the [MISC Saudi-Yemen  ] border , noting that “we have been arresting between one to two thousand people each day.” He also admitted that the [MISC Saudis  ] have maintained a common practice of feeding those caught crossing before transporting them back across the border. “We need to change that , ” he went on , since many may be crossing the border only to get a meal . 
Prince [PER Mohammed  ] pointed out that a key feature of the [MISC Saudi  ] approach to undermine [MISC Al-Qaida’s  ] growth in [LOC Yemen  ] is to bolster the central government , in particular with substantial financial assistance . 
A [ORG Saudi-Yemeni Council  ] meets twice a year to review development projects in [LOC Yemen  ] funded by [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] . 
However , up to now , he reported , the [MISC Saudis  ] have not been satisfied with the distribution of these development and infrastructure projects because the [MISC Yemeni  ] government has been concentrating them in [LOC Sanaa  ] and other urban areas . 
The [MISC Saudis  ] now insist on having a say in distributing these infrastructure investments with remote areas receiving priority “to give the tribes in those areas something to lose if they cooperate with terrorists.” [MISC Afghanistan/Pakistan  ] -------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) General [PER Jones  ] noted that the [MISC Obama  ] administration’s approach in [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] reflects many of the same lessons that the [MISC Saudis  ] have learned . 
That is why the [LOC U.S.  ] is working with a new emphasis on national reunification in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The approach includes reducing the emphasis on military operations while exerting new efforts to encourage reconciliation . 
In order for this strategy to succeed , [PER Gen. Jones  ] cautioned , it will be essential that [MISC Pakistani  ] territory no longer be available as a safehaven to terrorists. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Prince [PER Mohammed  ] commented that “Pakistan must let people know that it is fighting a war to keep [LOC Pakistan  ] united and its people safe.” But if we want one hundred percent from them , he cautioned , we should make them feel more secure on their border with [LOC India  ] . 
He also noted that King [PER Abdullah  ] “has concerns about the [MISC Pakistani  ] government ; the biggest problem is the army.” General [PER Kayani  ] ( Army Chief of Staff ) is a good man ; I asked him , Prince [PER Mohammed  ] recounted , whether or not his soldiers , when they visit their villages , wear their uniforms , or if they changed into civilian clothes . 
He told me that they change to civilian clothes. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) General [PER Jones  ] assured Prince [PER Mohammed  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] is working to reduce [MISC Pakistani-Indian  ] tensions , and emphasized that what is most needed at this moment is for [LOC Pakistan  ] to choose which path it wants to take . 
The first step is to dislodge the terrorists ; if [LOC Pakistan  ] resolves to do this , they will find that the [LOC U.S.  ] will help them for some time to come . 
The [MISC Pakistani  ] ISI also needs to act with greater consistency . 
Noting [MISC Saudi  ] Arabia’s influence with [LOC Pakistan  ] , General [PER Jones  ] emphasized that the [LOC U.S.  ] is looking for [MISC Saudi  ] Arabia’s support . 
Next Phase with [LOC Iran  ] -------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) General [PER Jones  ] described the administration’s current thinking on [LOC Iran  ] , noting that [LOC Iran  ] has failed to enter into a serious dialogue with the international community about its nuclear program . 
With the deadline of the end of the year now passed , it is time to start looking at sanctions . 
Prince [PER Mohammed  ] said [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] remains greatly concerned about [ORG Iran’s  ] nuclear program and noted that there is now a big crack in the [MISC Iranian  ] government , particularly following the recent attack on [PER Karroubi  ] . 
( Embassy note: Opposition leader [PER Mehdi Karroubi’s  ] car was fired upon on January 9 , an attack that oppositionist attribute to [ORG Iran’s Revolutionary Guard  ] . 
End note . 
) High Marks for [ORG U.S.-Saudi Counterterrorism Cooperation  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) General [PER Jones  ] asked Prince [PER Mohammed  ] if there was anything needed from the [LOC U.S.  ] to improve our counterterrorism coordination . 
Prince [PER Mohammed  ] responded that King [PER Abdullah  ] has made very clear that [ORG U.S.-Saudi  ] security cooperation must remain independent of political buffeting . 
He said that our cooperation is very good , and has developed to the point that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] are in “simultaneous mode” regarding the sharing of raw data and threat information . 
[PER Gen. Jones  ] remarked that Prince [PER Mohammed  ] has played an important role in bringing about this strong security relationship , and conveyed President Obama’s appreciation for this strong partnership . 
Comment ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) We note that Prince [PER Mohammed  ] did not raise the matter of recently introduced heightened screening procedures on [MISC Saudi  ] citizens . 
While we have heard that these new measures provoked strong reactions from some in the [MISC Saudi  ] leadership , the absence of any expressions of concern or upset on Prince [PER Mohammed  ] part is fully in keeping with his reputation as one who fully understands the difficulty of maneuvering against extremist elements to prevent attacks . 
The Embassy views this meeting as accomplishing the important objective of reinforcing our strong counterterrorism cooperation . 
As is evident from his brief responses to [PER Gen. Jones’  ] briefs on [LOC Iran  ] and [MISC Afghanistan/Pakistan  ] , these issues are ones on which Prince [PER Mohammed  ] carefully defers to the King .
