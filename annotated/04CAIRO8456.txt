( C ) In a November 13 meeting at the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] , [ORG NEA  ] Assistant Secretary [PER Bill Burns  ] and [MISC Egyptian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Ahmed Aboul Gheit  ] recalled events surrounding [PER Yasser Arafat  ] 's funeral the previous day and discussed the upcoming [LOC Iraq  ] conference in [LOC Sharm El Sheikh  ] . 
[PER Aboul Gheit  ] noted his desire to make the conference one of interaction and many bilateral discussions rather than focusing on formal group meetings . 
A primary goal was to " enable dialogue . 
" He said the communique " went a little beyond [ORG UNSC  ] 1546 , " which in his view was appropriate to draw attention to the roles of regional players , including the [ORG Arab League  ] . 
He cautioned against the negative optic of [MISC Americans  ] fighting in [LOC Falluja  ] during the conference . 
He suggested an informal encounter between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Iranian  ] foreign ministers in [LOC Sharm El Sheikh.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Aboul Gheit  ] stressed the need for [LOC Israel  ] to help facilitate [MISC Palestinian  ] elections logistically . 
Noting his plans to visit [LOC Ramallah  ] on November 24 , he was concerned that [LOC Israel  ] would seek other reasons for not engaging now that [PER Yasser Arafat  ] was out of the picture . 
The Minister also cited the need for [MISC GOI  ] " gestures " like prisoner releases to give [MISC Palestinian  ] leaders credibility . 
[PER Aboul Gheit  ] said [LOC Syria  ] was showing appropriate restraint . 
On [LOC Sudan  ] , [PER Aboul Gheit  ] reiterated his desire to speak at the November 18 [ORG UNSC  ] session to be held in [LOC Nairobi  ] . 
He discussed the best timing for a trip to the [LOC U.S.  ] in the spring . 
This message concludes with a few bio notes on [PER Aboul Gheit  ] , who has now been in office for 120 days . 
End summary. -------------- [PER Arafat  ] funeral -------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Aboul Gheit  ] recalled the funeral services for [PER Yasser Arafat  ] the previous day , noting the " scary " experience of landing in [LOC Ramallah  ] for the burial . 
The crowd did not concern him so much as the tight landing area , which he said had the pilot somewhat worried about a safe touchdown . 
Describing his ginger exit from the helicopter and 45-minute journey to a nearby building in the thick crowd , he commended the [LOC PA  ] for going to their " fall back " position of a direct burial ( without the anticipated viewing in a building full of dignitaries ) . 
He said [PER Abu Mazen  ] calmly received word that " it 's done " when many were still anticipating a formal viewing . 
In sum , the funeral was " an experience . 
" ---------------- [LOC Sharm  ] conference ---------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The Minister described his intention to make the November 22-23 [LOC Sharm El Sheikh  ] conference an opportunity for interaction between delegations . 
Events , including a dinner and a lunch , would be available to all delegation heads , yet no one would be obligated to join any set event . 
The design is intended to " enable dialogue " by offering " just the setting . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) As for a basic agenda , he cited a two-hour meeting of [LOC Iraq  ] 's neighbors plus the [ORG UN  ] on November 22 , followed by a dinner to which all foreign ministers were welcome . 
( [PER A/S Burns  ] also suggested a bilateral with Secretary [PER Powell  ] on November 22 if schedules permitted . 
) Breakfast on November 23 would be at leisure and bilateral meetings were encouraged . 
A 10:00 a.m. meeting would be an opportunity for delegations to give statements if they chose -- four minutes or so for each delegation who desired . 
[PER Aboul Gheit  ] said he would clarify at the outset , however , that not all delegations were obligated to speak . 
" We will not insist on hearing from everyone . 
" After a luncheon on November 23 , [PER Aboul Gheit  ] hoped the afternoon could be designed to " encourage interaction " between the various delegations rather than formal group meetings . 
[PER Aboul Gheit  ] said he would offer a statement to the press and take questions during the afternoon as well. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Aboul Gheit  ] said the communique " went a little beyond [ORG UNSC  ] 1546 , " which in his view was appropriate since regional powers and regional organizations were meeting to engage more deeply on [LOC Iraq  ] . 
A strong reference to the role of the [ORG Arab League  ] , for example , could encourage Secretary General [PER Amre Moussa  ] ( " oblige him " ) to act within an agreed framework. ---- [LOC Iraq  ] ---- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Not wanting to " jump to conclusions " about how events in [LOC Falluja  ] might turn out , [PER Aboul Gheit  ] said the issue was not " taking over the city " but preventing violence and terror from spreading to other cities . 
He said " [ORG Mosul  ] today reflects [LOC Falluja  ] six months ago . 
" [PER A/S Burns  ] noted that [ORG Mosul  ] was looking better then a few days prior , and that planning for [LOC Falluja  ] involved extensive and immediate economic recovery assistance . 
The " day after " plans would help bring law and order to [LOC Falluja  ] and would make life more hopeful for its residents -- including efforts at job creation . 
Similar programs in [LOC Najaf  ] and [LOC Sadr City  ] had emphasized hope and inclusion in rebuilding efforts , said [PER A/S Burns  ] ; the upcoming conference in [LOC Egypt  ] should stress a similar commitment to international engagement . 
[PER Aboul Gheit  ] said " your problem is not that the [LOC U.S.  ] military fought well , but that they are on TV " too often . 
[MISC Iraqi  ] forces should be in the limelight , he stressed. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Expressing his hope that the [LOC U.S.  ] role would not leave " a bitter impression in the [MISC Sunni  ] world , " [PER Aboul Gheit  ] cited media scenes of [LOC U.S.  ] forces running through mosques while firing their weapons ; " these are scenes one must be careful with . 
" A better impression would result if " [PER Mahmoud  ] and [PER Mohammed  ] " were searching the mosque , not " [PER John  ] and [PER Jack  ] . 
" --------- [LOC Palestine  ] --------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER A/S Burns  ] noted that Secretary [PER Powell  ] was considering a trip to [LOC Jerusalem  ] around the time of the [LOC Sharm El Sheikh  ] conference . 
A key topic would be practical support for [MISC Palestinian  ] elections , including pressing [LOC Israel  ] to cooperate . 
[PER Aboul Gheit  ] said he also planned to visit ( likely [LOC Ramallah  ] ) on November 24 . 
He lamented that President [PER Bush  ] and [MISC British  ] Prime Minister [PER Blair  ] had " put everything on the [MISC Palestinians  ] " instead of citing [LOC Israel  ] 's need to help facilitate meaningful elections . 
He asked how a people could elect a leader without having freedom of movement within their own cities . 
[PER Aboul Gheit  ] feared that the [MISC GOI  ] might find further pretexts to avoid engagement with the [MISC Palestinians  ] , continuing their " no partner " mantra with a new formula . 
[PER Burns  ] noted that meaningful [MISC Palestinian  ] elections were " deeply in [LOC Israel  ] 's interest " and an opportunity to help stabilize the region if properly handled. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Aboul Gheit  ] floated the idea of the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] , [LOC Israel  ] , and the [MISC Palestinians  ] getting together to " launch a process " towardreconciliation . 
[PER A/S Burns  ] said the idea may be premature , but was nonetheless worth keeping in mind . 
He said it was important to " make sure there is a practical commitment " on all sides first . 
[PER Aboul Gheit  ] 's goal was to " implicate [LOC Israel  ] in a process . 
" The Minister and his staff also cited the need for [MISC GOI  ] " gestures " like prisoner releases , in addition to logistical support , to make elections ( and newly-elected leaders ) a success . 
The lack of such gestures from [LOC Israel  ] undercut [PER Abu Mazen  ] 's authority as Prime Minister , they opined . 
Failure to capitalize on current opportunities to reopen negotiations could doom the conflict to continue into the next century , concluded [PER Aboul Gheit  ] . 
He said Intelligence Chief [PER Omar Soliman  ] would also be gathering [MISC Palestinian  ] factions for cease fire talks in [LOC Cairo  ] once again , but did not elaborate. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER A/S Burns  ] said the [LOC PA  ] needed to demonstrate that it could govern responsibly , and deliver things for [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
He had told [MISC Syrian  ] President [PER Asad  ] ( in a brief conversation at the [PER Arafat  ] funeral ) that it was important for all parties to use their influence to keep things calm . 
[PER Aboul Gheit  ] said [LOC Syria  ] had manifested that desire for some time and was showing restraint . 
The [MISC Syrian  ] Foreign Minister had reaffirmed the same in [LOC Cairo  ] the previous week , he asserted. ---- [LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Asking how the [ORG USG  ] might interface with the [MISC Iranians  ] in [LOC Sharm El Sheikh  ] , [PER Aboul Gheit  ] recommended that Secretary [PER Powell  ] approach the [MISC Iranian  ] Foreign Minister in a " small group " and break off for a few seconds of private discussion . 
After mingling , a simple " [PER Kamal  ] , let 's have a talk " might lead the way to a formal bilateral , said [PER Aboul Gheit  ] , who was certain that the [MISC Iranians  ] would not make the first move. ----- [LOC Sudan  ] ----- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER A/S Burns  ] expressed appreciation for [PER Aboul Gheit  ] 's interest in addressing a [ORG UNSC  ] meeting to be held in [LOC Nairobi  ] November 18 and 19 . 
[PER Aboul Gheit  ] said he wanted to deliver a statement early on November 18 ( because he needed to return to [LOC Cairo  ] ) and asked for assistance in getting his name on the speakers list for a brief presentation. ---------------- Bilateral Agenda ---------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) After a brief listing of pending bilateral issues , [PER Aboul Gheit  ] asked when might be the best time for him to visit the [LOC U.S.  ] He agreed that an early February visit , when the [ORG Congress  ] was back in session and a likely [PER Mubarak  ] visit was a month or two in the future , might be most appropriate to " bring to bear a certain impression " of the relationship . 
He also floated the idea of another visit after a [MISC Mubarak  ] trip . 
[PER A/S Burns  ] encouraged [LOC Egypt  ] to send other ministers in the meantime to keep the issues and personalities clear in the minds of [ORG USG  ] interlocutors. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Referring to Armed Forces Chief of Staff [ORG Weheba  ] 's early December visit to [LOC Washington  ] , [PER Aboul Gheit  ] said the [ORG Lantos  ] amendment ( to reassign portions of military aid to economic assistance ) " will be defeated , I assure you . 
" --------- Bio notes --------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) About [PER Gheit  ] volunteered during the meeting that he was " a grandfather for the second time . 
" His daughter , [PER Lara  ] , had delivered a daughter , [PER Tamara  ] , the previous day while he was involved in [PER Arafat  ] 's funeral . 
He also reinforced his protocol-conscious approach to diplomacy in describing an invitation from [LOC U.S.  ] PermRep to the [PER UN Danforth  ] which he regretted because the invitation was not personalized . 
When the invitation was reissued with his name properly personalized , he was ready to accept the invitation ; in the interim , however , he was called back to [LOC Cairo  ] to begin his tenure as Foreign Minister. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Citing his 120 days on the job as very busy for him and for his staff ( a comment confirmed in the fatigued faces around the room ) , [PER Aboul Gheit  ] said he looked forward to putting his feet up and enjoying a beer at his farm the following day ( the beginning of the post-Ramadan feast ) . 
His staff later noted that having the minister away from the office offered some reprieve from a hectic pace , but that he would no doubt keep them busy from a distance during the next few days of holiday. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( U ) A/S [PER Burns  ] has cleared this cable. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( U ) [LOC Baghdad  ] minimized considered .
