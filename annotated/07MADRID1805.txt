2006 MADRID 1914 Classified By: DCM HUGO LLORENS FOR REASONS 1.4 ( B ) AND ( C ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S/NF ) Based on [MISC Reftel A  ] request , [ORG Embassy Legatt  ] on September 4 met with [PER Javier Zaragoza  ] , Chief of the [ORG Spanish National Court  ] , to discuss the case of [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainees [PER Jamil El Banna  ] and [PER Omar Deghays  ] . 
[PER Legatt  ] reminded [PER Zaragoza  ] that the [ORG GOS  ] requested the extradition of [LOC El Banna  ] and [PER Deghays  ] in 2004 and inquired whether the two continued to face charges in [LOC Spain  ] . 
Specifically , we asked whether the [MISC Spanish  ] government is prepared to accept their transfer for law enforcement purposes . 
[PER Zaragoza  ] was very familiar with the cases surrounding the two individuals and has been looking into this issue since we made informal contact in July . 
He promised to look into Reftel questions and respond as soon as possible . 
[PER Zaragoza  ] finally responded on September 12 and said that the two individuals are still wanted in [LOC Spain  ] and that the [MISC Spanish  ] government would accept their transfer . 
However , [PER Zaragoza  ] quickly added that he could make no promises about the strength of the case that could be brought against them , the probability they would be convicted , or their status in [LOC Spain  ] should they be found not guilty and released . 
He said he was not optimistic about the chances of a conviction . 
[PER Zaragoza  ] said that [PER Baltasar Garzon  ] is in charge of the two cases and would be the lead prosecutor during any potential trial. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S/NF ) Comment . 
Judge [PER Garzon  ] was the prosecutor on both the [PER Lachsen Ikassrien  ] and [PER Hamid Abdurrahman  ] cases ( per Reftel B , the two former [MISC Guantanamo  ] inmates whose convictions in [LOC Spain  ] were later overturned after the [ORG Spanish High Court  ] ruled inadmissible any evidence gathered in conjunction with their time at [LOC Guantanamo  ] ) , and he had a field day in the [MISC Spanish  ] press criticizing [MISC Guantanamo  ] and [ORG US CT  ] policies after the two men were released . 
[PER Zaragoza  ] warned of the possibility of a similar situation should the cases of [LOC El Banna  ] and [PER Deghays  ] fall apart , and [ORG Embassy Madrid  ] believes the publicity-seeking [PER Garzon  ] would not think twice about following a similar tack .
