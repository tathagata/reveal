Argyros  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Ambassador met with [MISC Spanish  ] Foreign Minister [PER Miguel Angel Moratinos  ] November 10 at the Foreign Ministry for a farewell call . 
Ambassador began by saying it was time to get the [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] relationship moving forward . 
[PER Moratinos  ] agreed and said [LOC Spain  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] needed to start working on a positive agenda . 
[PER Moratinos  ] said [LOC Spain  ] could be helpful in many areas -- [LOC Spain  ] has credibility in the [LOC Middle East  ] and [LOC Latin America  ] , for example . 
[PER Moratinos  ] stated [PER Zapatero  ] wanted to work with President [PER Bush  ] to move relations forward and noted that the fact that President [PER Bush  ] had not returned [PER Zapatero  ] 's congratulatory phone call was not playing well in the media . 
" We need to improve relations and a return call would be a good gesture on the [LOC U.S  ] . 
's part , " said [ORG Moratinos.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Moratinos  ] also stated the [PER Zapatero  ] government wants to build on the good relations the [MISC Aznar  ] administration established , not tear them down . 
[PER Moratinos  ] added , " In this Ministry , you know we are not always consulted on certain actions taken by others , " likely referring to recent negative comments about the [LOC U.S.  ] by Minister of [ORG Defense  ] [PER Jose Bono.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Moratinos  ] said he is committed to working hard on our bilateral relations , and suggested some topics that could be brought to the forefront as visible examples of cooperation between our two countries . 
Fore example , [LOC Spain  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] could renew the [ORG Joint Declaration  ] on [ORG Defense Relations  ] signed by Foreign Minister [PER Pique  ] and Secretary [PER Albright  ] in January <a id='par2001' href='#par2001'>¶</a>2001 . 
Another idea was to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the [MISC Transatlantic Agenda  ] between the [LOC U.S  ] , and the [ORG EU  ] , which was originally a [MISC Spanish  ] idea. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Moratinos  ] offered [LOC Spain  ] 's help in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
He said he knows all of the [MISC Palestinian  ] leadership . 
In particular , he knows [PER Abu Mazen  ] well , and if [PER Mazen  ] is elected [MISC Palestinian  ] president , [PER Moratinos  ] offered to serve as an intermediary if the [LOC U.S.  ] wished . 
On his recent visit to [LOC Syria  ] , [PER Moratinos  ] said the sole reason he went to [LOC Syria  ] was to ask the [MISC Syrians  ] to " behave " with regards to the [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
More generally , [PER Moratinos  ] noted that the country with the most experience in the [LOC Middle East  ] , [LOC Spain  ] , was not invited to participate in the [ORG Forum for the Future  ] to be held in [LOC Morocco  ] in December . 
He understood why [LOC Spain  ] could not attend as part of the [MISC G-8  ] , but said perhaps [LOC Spain  ] could go as guests of the [MISC Moroccan  ] government . 
[LOC Spain  ] has excellent relations with [LOC Morocco  ] and with November 2005 being the 10-year anniversary of the [ORG Barcelona Process  ] , it may be appropriate for [LOC Spain  ] to be part of this group . 
However , [PER Moratinos  ] quickly added that they would accept a [MISC Moroccan  ] invitation only if the [LOC U.S.  ] had no objection. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Argyros  ] suggested [LOC Spain  ] make a strong gesture to show its support for the return of democracy to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
This would not require returning [MISC Spanish  ] troops to [LOC Iraq  ] but perhaps the [ORG GOS  ] could train a large contingent of [MISC Iraqi  ] police officers in [LOC Spain  ] and publicize it widely. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) On [LOC Latin America  ] , [PER Moratinos  ] noted that [LOC Venezuela  ] 's [PER Chavez  ] would be visiting [LOC Spain  ] November 22-23 . 
[PER Moratinos  ] asked if the [LOC U.S.  ] wanted to convey a message to [PER Chavez  ] . 
Ambassador asked [PER Moratinos  ] to raise the increasing drug trafficking problem in [LOC Venezuela  ] -- more and more shipments bound for [LOC Europe  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] appear to be departing from [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[PER Moratinos  ] welcomed a non-paper if we wanted to submit one. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) With respect to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , Ambassador noted we had heard the [MISC Spanish  ] ambassador to [ORG NATO  ] has raised the possibility that [LOC Spain  ] would be willing to staff a Provincial Reconstruction Team ( PRT ) in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Moratinos  ] was aware of the idea but said no decision had been made yet . 
He noted it was not " totally unrealistic " [LOC Spain  ] would participate in a [LOC PRT.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The meeting ended with [PER Moratinos  ] informing the Ambassador he would be traveling to the [LOC U.S.  ] early in 2005 to do " outreach work " with think tanks and government officials , and hoped to get an assessment of how [LOC Spain  ] is thought about in the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC ARGYROS</pre></code>  ]
