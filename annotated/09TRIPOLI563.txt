[ORG De la Pena  ] told [ORG A/S Carson  ] she had written a letter of congratulation on his appointment and included a book -- [ORG Spanish Plan: Africa  ] 2009-2012 -- in the hopes of deepening [MISC Spanish-U.S.  ] coordination in [MISC African  ] affairs .

Noting that [LOC Spain  ] was the closest [MISC European  ] country to [LOC Africa  ] , she highlighted a mid-June summit between [MISC Spanish  ] President [MISC Zapatero  ] and [ORG ECOWAS  ] leaders as evidence of [LOC Spain  ] 's increased focus on peace and security issues .

Shifting to [LOC East Africa  ] , [ORG A/S Carson  ] laid out [ORG USG  ] priorities in [LOC Somalia  ] . 
[ORG De la Pena  ] said that [LOC Spain  ] had provided six million [MISC Euros  ] to the [MISC Somali  ] [ORG Transitional Federal Government  ] ( [ORG TFG  ] ) police through the [ORG AU  ] , but was still waiting for that organization to take a decision on how to spend the money . 
[ORG De la Pena  ] was interested in [ORG USG  ] views on how to handle [MISC Somali  ] piracy , particularly our position on judicial action against pirates . 
[ORG A/S Carson  ] said that [LOC Kenya  ] had so far borne much of the responsibility , but noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] had taken swift action against the surviving [ORG MAERSK  ] ALABAMA hijacker in [LOC U.S.  ] courts . 
[ORG A/S Carson  ] urged [LOC Spain  ] to arrest and convict [MISC Somali  ] pirates who were apprehended attempting to hijack [MISC Spanish  ] owned or [MISC Spanish  ] flagged vessels . 
[ORG De la Pena  ] sought clarification on [ORG Africa Command  ] 's role on the continent . 
The Assistant Secretary said that the [ORG Command  ] was still evolving but would in time become like [ORG EUCOM  ] and PACOM - focusing more on mil-mil cooperation , training peace keepers , and building professional militaries that would operate under civilian constitutional rule and focus on external defense .
