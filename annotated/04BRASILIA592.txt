( [ORG SBU  ] ) Although no announcement has been made on the selection of the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] 's ( [ORG FAB  ] ) next high performance jet fighter , the [MISC F-X  ] , the [ORG GOB  ] could be setting the stage for a decision on the purchase of the 12 aircraft . 
In the [MISC F-X  ] competition , [ORG Embraer  ] is currently partnered with [ORG Dassault  ] in offering the Mirage 2000-5 . 
According to an " [ORG O Globo  ] " press report , Minister of [ORG Defense  ] [PER Jose Viegas  ] told a business audience that , regardless of the outcome of the competition , and even if it loses in its joint bid with [ORG Dassault  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] 's aviation giant [ORG Embraer  ] " ought to be contracted to provide specific services " to the winning consortium. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC F-X  ] selection will be made by the [ORG National Defense Council  ] in the presidency which has already received technical input from the [ORG MOD  ] . 
The [ORG GOB  ] has missed a number of self-imposed deadlines for a decision on the [MISC F-X  ] , and the wait could be extended further . 
In discussing [ORG MOD  ] procurement priorities , Minister [PER Viegas  ] said in the March 8 [ORG Sao Paulo Gazeta  ] Mercantil that the [MISC F-X  ] decision " will be made this year " -- a statement that hints an announcement may not be forthcoming soon. -------------- The [LOC U.S.  ] Offer -------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Lockheed Martin  ] has given up its attempt to partner with [ORG Varig Engineering and Maintenance  ] ( [ORG VEM  ] ) . 
A subsidiary of [ORG Varig  ] , [ORG VEM  ] was unresponsive to [ORG Lockheed Martin  ] 's proposed program to offer refurbished [MISC F-16s  ] . 
Observers agree that [ORG Varig  ] 's current financial woes , and its epileptic merger effort with rival [ORG TAM  ] , may have forced [ORG VEM  ] to remain on the sidelines . 
While [ORG Lockheed Martin  ] 's [MISC F-16  ] offer remains in the [MISC F-X  ] competition , the company lacks a strong [MISC Brazilian  ] mate in its tender and this likely limits [ORG Lockheed  ] 's prospects. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In a conversation March 10 with visiting [ORG CJCS General Myers  ] , Minister [PER Viegas  ] commented that [ORG Lockheed-Martin  ] 's best and final offer ( [ORG BAFO  ] ) for new [MISC F-16s  ] left him with the impression the company " was not serious " about winning the competition . 
The Minister also expressed concern about restrictions imposed by [ORG USG  ] in case [LOC Brazil  ] was to buy [LOC US  ] weapon systems , in particular the [ORG AAMRAM  ] missile , and appeared surprised when told the [ORG GOB  ] had been provided written assurance from the [ORG USG  ] that the [ORG AAMRAM  ] is available without strings attached . 
The Minister also appeared unaware that the [LOC Netherlands  ] had made available recently , for just $8 million each , refurbished used [MISC F-16s  ] that are comparable in performance to new aircraft. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment: While the USD 700 million [MISC F-X  ] program price tag still causes sticker shock , there is no indication at this time the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] will lower its aspirations for new rather than used aircraft . 
But two trends appear evident: the [ORG GOB  ] may be delaying a decision for budgetary or other reasons , and the eventual tender winner will have to give [ORG Embraer  ] a piece of the action .
