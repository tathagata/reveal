( C ) Summary and comment: [PER Pierre Moscovici  ] , the [ORG Socialist Party  ] 's National Secretary for International Relations , met May 29 with visiting Ambassador to [ORG NATO  ] Nuland to discuss transatlantic relations in the context of [LOC France  ] 's 2007 presidential elections .

[LOC France  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] should strive for agreement whenever possible , he asserted , even if [LOC France  ] can never be like the [LOC UK  ] -- what he described as " neither [PER Chirac  ] nor [PER Blair  ] " -- and should continue talking even when they don't agree . 
He welcomed the warming in transatlantic relations since President [PER Bush  ] 's visit to [LOC Brussels  ] in 2005 but insisted that divisions between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Europe  ] would remain , given continuing [MISC French  ] concerns about [LOC U.S  ] . 
" unilateralist tendencies . 
" The meeting sent a useful signal that the [LOC U.S.  ] is eager to engage both sides of the political aisle on [ORG NATO  ] issues , even if [PER Moscovici  ] tended to see the transatlantic relationship in terms of the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [ORG EU  ] . 
End summary and comment. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a May 29 meeting with visiting Ambassador to [ORG NATO  ] [PER Victoria Nuland  ] , [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PS  ] ) National Secretary for International Affairs [PER Pierre Moscovici  ] discussed the likely positions of a [ORG PS  ] administration on transatlantic relations if the Socialist candidate wins the 2007 presidential elections , while making clear that he could not speak authoritatively for the eventual [ORG PS  ] presidential candidate . 
Acknowledging at the outset that he was personally close to former Finance Minister [PER Dominique Strauss-Kahn  ] , [PER Moscovici  ] described the candidate selection in November -- to be determined through a vote among the party 's rank and file -- as a contest between a popular front-runner ( [PER Segolene Royal  ] ) , an outsider ( former prime minister [PER Lionel Jospin  ] ) and two insiders ( in particular [PER Strauss-Kahn  ] and former Prime Minister [PER Laurent Fabius  ] ) . 
[PER Moscovici  ] judged that the [ORG PS  ] had a 50-50 chance of winning the elections. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Moscovici  ] noted the first anniversary of [LOC France  ] 's rejection of the [ORG EU  ] constitutional treaty . 
While he rejected the notion that the [MISC French  ] " no " was the cause of the current crisis in [LOC Europe  ] , it had nonetheless deepened an already existing crisis . 
He did not expect a renegotiation of the treaty until after the 2007 elections , explaining that President [PER Chirac  ] 's lame-duck status and damaged credibility precluded meaningful initiatives in the interim . 
[PER Moscovici  ] attributed [MISC French  ] unease with [ORG EU  ] enlargement as perhaps the major factor in the treaty 's rejection , saying that enlargement had proceeded too quickly and without sufficient debate . 
Even if one argued that enlargement was " good , " it could not substitute for the absence of a tangible " project . 
" As a vice-president in the [MISC European  ] Parliament , he felt he could nonetheless state with relative certainty that [LOC Romania  ] and [LOC Bulgaria  ] would join the [ORG EU  ] in 2007 , although this would not occur without some difficult debate. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Turning to [MISC U.S.-EU  ] relations , [PER Moscovici  ] regretted what he called a wrong [LOC U.S.  ] decision to invade [LOC Iraq  ] , but he welcomed the [LOC U.S.  ] stress on renewed partnership since 2005 . 
That said , he believed that " unilateral " strains in [LOC U.S.  ] thinking , combined with divisiveness among the [MISC Europeans  ] , meant that some frictions in the transatlantic relationship would continue . 
The [ORG EU  ] was more regionally focused , he judged , as compared with the more global vision of the [LOC U.S.  ] All that said , it was important for all to understand that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Europe  ] had no better allies than each other , so it was important to make the best of the relationship . 
There was no other real choice. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Moscovici  ] asserted that the [ORG PS  ] leadership was favorably disposed toward the [LOC U.S.  ] and described the [ORG PS  ] as ultimately less anti-American than [PER Chirac  ] . 
While it was likely to be tougher on questions of principle , he judged that the [ORG PS  ] would be more flexible in practice . 
He described [PER Chirac  ] as a dogmatist who had pandered too much to domestic opinion , and accused [PER Chirac  ] of actively working against the [LOC U.S.  ] in the run-up to the [LOC Iraq  ] war and threatening a veto " too early , " before the [ORG UN  ] had had an opportunity to explore all possible avenues . 
Although the [ORG PS  ] was also opposed to the [LOC Iraq  ] war , he contended that , unlike [PER Chirac  ] , it also would not have broken off dialogue with the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Moscovici  ] claimed that , historically , [MISC French-U.S.  ] relations had been strongest when the left was in power , primarily because the [ORG PS  ] did not hold certain negative attitudes toward the [LOC U.S.  ] The [ORG PS  ] , he said , would base its relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] on cool-headed analysis rather than emotion , taking into account the bedrock values the [LOC Europe  ] and [LOC America  ] share . 
[LOC PARIS  ] 00003721 002 OF 002 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Moscovici  ] asserted that [LOC France  ] under a [ORG PS  ] administration would be " neither [PER Blair  ] nor [PER Chirac  ] . 
" [LOC France  ] viewed itself as fully [MISC European  ] , and , unlike the [LOC UK  ] , not as a bridge between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Europe  ] . 
But it was incumbent on the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC France  ] despite certain differences to maintain at all times a constructive dialogue . 
They should strive to find agreement whenever possible , he continued , citing specifically [LOC Darfur  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and [LOC Kosovo  ] , as well as [LOC France  ] 's membership in [ORG NATO  ] . 
Of course , [LOC France  ] would sometimes oppose [LOC U.S.  ] policy , such as on [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Even then , however , it would be important to keep talking , without lies and dissimulation . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] should also understand that a [ORG PS  ] administration would want more than the center-right to " [LOC Europeanize  ] " [LOC France  ] 's foreign policy . 
While proud of [LOC France  ] 's status as a [ORG UNSC  ] permanent member , the [ORG PS  ] understood that it could not act on its own and therefore needed [ORG ESDP  ] . 
In that regard , speaking personally , [PER Moscovici  ] said he hoped [LOC France  ] would not only maintain , but increase current defense expenditure levels . 
Ambassador [PER Nuland  ] welcomed [MISC French  ] leadership in that regard , adding that [LOC Europe  ] also needed [MISC French  ] leadership . 
She urged [PER Moscovici  ] to view [ORG NATO  ] not as a [MISC U.S.-owned  ] vehicle , but one in which [LOC France  ] was also a large stakeholder. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Asked about the weight of security policy issues in the upcoming elections , [PER Moscovici  ] said that [MISC French  ] voters were more motivated by domestic concerns . 
He noted that that [LOC U.S.  ] emphasis on anti-terrorism was not shared by the [MISC French  ] public , which did not view itself as a target . 
Moreover , there was currently great skepticism toward the [ORG EU  ] as well as the [LOC U.S.  ] , whereby [ORG PS  ] voters were generally much more negative than the party leadership and would need to be led toward more positive attitudes toward the [ORG EU  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Moscovici  ] assured Ambassador [PER Nuland  ] that all the main Socialist candidates -- [PER Jospin  ] , [PER Strauss-Kahn  ] , and even former Culture Minister [PER Jack Lang  ] -- were reasonable and realistic on this count . 
He indicated , however , that he could not speak for [PER Segolene Royal  ] , given that her positions on the issues were still largely unknown . 
( Comment: [PER Moscovici  ] is not a [PER Segolene Royal  ] supporter . 
End comment . 
) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Nuland  ] concluded the meeting by extending an invitation to the [ORG PS  ] presidential candidate 's foreign policy advisor to visit [LOC Brussels  ] and become more personally familiar with [ORG NATO  ] . 
[PER Moscovici  ] pledged to remain in touch , cautioning that an election team probably would not be formed until the end of the year , after the selection of the party 's candidate. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Comment: In discussing transatlantic relations , [PER Moscovici  ] tended to speak in terms of the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [LOC Europe  ] . 
The meeting nonetheless served a useful purpose in sensitizing [ORG PS  ] officials to [ORG NATO  ] issues and , through Ambassador [PER Nuland  ] 's active pursuit of a meeting with party officials on both sides of the aisle , demonstrated [LOC U.S.  ] willingness to engage them on [ORG NATO  ] in the run-up to the presidential elections and beyond . 
End comment. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) This message was cleared by Ambassador [PER Nuland  ] .
