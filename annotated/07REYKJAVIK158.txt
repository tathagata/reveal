[PER Carol van Voorst  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: [LOC Iceland  ] 's new government coalition of the [ORG Independence Party  ] ( [ORG IP  ] ) and the [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) announced their ministers and policy statement on May 22-23 . 
[PER Geir Haarde  ] will stay on as Prime Minister , while [ORG SDA  ] leader [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] will become [LOC Iceland  ] 's second female Foreign Minister . 
The center-right [ORG IP  ] retains control of the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] ( under current minister [PER Bjorn Bjarnason  ] ) and made few changes to its cabinet lineup . 
In addition to Foreign Affairs , most of the key economic and welfare ministries went to the center-left [ORG SDA  ] . 
The coalition 's policy statement focused almost exclusively on domestic social welfare issues , with a sole paragraph on foreign policy containing a deliberately ambiguous sentence " lamenting the war in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
" Post believes that on key [LOC U.S.  ] policy concerns PM [PER Haarde  ] will work to keep bilateral relations on a smooth course , while [PER FM-designate Gisladottir  ] will work to quietly nudge [LOC Iceland  ] ever closer to [ORG EU  ] membership . 
[ORG SDA  ] control of the economic ministries may have implications for continued investment in power-intensive industries . 
Down the line , [PER Gisladottir  ] 's clear ambitions for the PM slot may trigger a coalition implosion partway through its 4-year term , with [PER Gisladottir  ] hoping that her party comes out of the rubble to lead a new center-left government . 
End comment . 
After 12 years , a new coalition ------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) After five days of formal negotiations , [ORG Independence Party  ] ( [ORG IP  ] ) Chairman [PER Geir Haarde  ] and [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) Chair [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] each received approval from their party governing boards for a new coalition agreement . 
They presented their ministerial lineups on the evening of May 22 . 
Each party received six ministerships , with the [MISC IP  ] retaining [PER Haarde  ] as Prime Minister . 
There was little change to the [MISC IP  ] slate of ministers apart from the consolidation of the [ORG Ministries of Fisheries and Agriculture  ] , and the addition of the [ORG Ministry of Health  ] ( which the [ORG Progressive Party  ] ran under the previous coalition ) . 
For the [ORG SDA  ] , [PER Gisladottir  ] took the FM slot after some speculation that she would opt instead for a greater role in domestic policy , perhaps through the melding of one or more current ministries . 
The resulting cabinet is as follows: Prime Minister: [PER Geir Haarde  ] ( [MISC IP  ] -- incumbent ) Foreign Minister: [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) Minister of Justice: [PER Bjorn Bjarnason  ] ( [MISC IP  ] -- incumbent ) Minister of [ORG Fisheries  ] and [ORG Agriculture:  ] [PER Einar Gudfinsson  ] ( [MISC IP  ] -- incumbent Minister of [LOC Fisheries  ] , gains Ag portfolio ) Minister of Education: [PER Thorgerdur Katrin Gunnarsdottir  ] ( [MISC IP  ] -- incumbent ) Minister of [ORG Finance:  ] [PER Arni Matthiessen  ] ( [MISC IP  ] -- incumbent ) Minister of [ORG Heath: Gudlaugur Thor Thordarson  ] ( [MISC IP  ] ) Minister of [ORG Industry:  ] [PER Ossur Skarphedinsson  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) Minister of [ORG Commerce:  ] [PER Bjorgvin Sigurdsson  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) ( Note: Previously there was a single [ORG Ministry of Industry  ] and [ORG Commerce  ] ) Minister of Social Welfare: [PER Johanna Sigurdardottir  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) Minister of [ORG Environment: Thorunn Sveinbjarnadottir  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) Minister of [ORG Transport:  ] [PER Kristjan Moller  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC IP-SDA  ] talks began on May 17 after the announcement that coalition talks between the [MISC IP  ] and the [ORG Progressive Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) , partners of 12 years , had collapsed . 
The fallout for the Progressives has been considerable , as [ORG PP Chair  ] [PER Sigurdsson  ] has since maintained that he was led to believe that [PER Haarde  ] was sincerely interested in continuing the coalition despite the shrinking of the [MISC IP-PP  ] majority to a single seat ( reftel ) . 
[PER Sigurdsson  ] voiced his disappointment and sense of betrayal when [MISC IP-SDA  ] talks began within hours of the [MISC IP-PP  ] announcement on the 17th , and his dismay only grew with reports that [PER Haarde  ] and [PER Gisladottir  ] had been in informal contact as early as May 16 . 
[PER Haarde  ] 's response has been to note that " everyone knows how the process works " after elections in a parliamentary system . 
[PER Sigurdsson  ] , who failed to be elected to parliament on May 12 , announced his resignation as [ORG Progressive Party Chair  ] immediately after the coalition agreement was presented to the public on May 23. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Procedurally , the new government formally takes office on May 24 at a meeting of the [ORG State Council  ] ( composed of the President , Prime Minister , and Cabinet ) . 
The old [ORG State Council  ] will convene , officially retire , and the new [ORG Council  ] will then convene . 
Afterwards , there will be a series of official ceremonies at the ministry buildings in [LOC Reykjavik  ] as outgoing ministers present the symbolic keys to their offices to their successors . 
Meanwhile , the [ORG Althingi  ] will convene during the week of May 28 to formally elect the Speaker of the [ORG Althingi  ] ( outgoing Minister of Transport [PER Sturla Bodvarsson  ] -- [ORG IP  ] ) and designate committee chairs and members . 
[ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000158 002 OF 003 New Policy Statement Focused on Welfare Issues --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) The coalition agreement 's statement of policy devotes extensive attention to social welfare and economic matters , with an obvious effort made to split the difference between each party 's campaign promises . 
The [MISC IP  ] managed to preserve the current emphasis on a business- and investment-friendly regulatory environment , maintaining and even reducing [LOC Iceland  ] 's current low corporate taxes and including guarantees that the private sector will continue to take the lead in [LOC Iceland  ] 's economy . 
( Comment: A move apparently intended to quash fears of a return to [LOC Iceland  ] 's heavily socialist economy of the 1970s and -80s . 
End comment . 
) At the same time , the [ORG SDA  ] pushed through its objectives of increased pension and state insurance expenditures for the elderly and disabled , as well as pledges of improved health care and services for children . 
[ORG SDA Chair  ] [PER Gisladottir  ] has also highlighted the agreement 's pledge to reduce or eliminate gender-based wage disparities ( a fitting effort for one of the founders of [LOC Iceland  ] 's " Women 's List " political party in the 1980s ) . 
The statement does not , however , clarify what moves will result from the [ORG SDA  ] 's control of the [ORG Ministries of Industry  ] , [ORG Commerce  ] , and Environment , which could have major implications for continued investment in the aluminum sector and other energy-intensive industries . 
Rather , the agreement 's language focuses on " finding a balance " between economic development and the use and protection of natural resources , without laying out concrete actions. ...but placates both parties on [LOC Iraq  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On foreign policy , the agreement reflects an obvious attempt to give the [ORG SDA  ] some cover regarding its election promise to remove [LOC Iceland  ] from the list of the [LOC Iraq  ] " [ORG Coalition of the Willing  ] " , while avoiding alienating the [MISC IP  ] ( and particularly those close to [PER David Oddsson  ] , who was PM at the time of the invasion ) . 
The [MISC Icelandic  ] wording chosen can be translated as the [MISC GOI  ] " lamenting " either " the war in [LOC Iraq  ] " or " the conduct of the war in [LOC Iraq  ] , " leaving ambiguous as to whether the statement refers to the current situation or the means by which the current situation came about . 
In comments to the press , the PM and FM have each presented their own view on what the statement means . 
For his part , PM [PER Haarde  ] said , " we know the history and the position of the parties [ in 2003 ] but of course we lament the situation there now , " adding that the [MISC GOI  ] will not let the events of four years ago affect its continued cooperation and efforts in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
( Note: [LOC Iceland  ] deploys a Public Information Officer to [ORG NATO  ] Training Mission-Iraq . 
End Note . 
) On the other hand , [PER FM-designate Gisladottir  ] claims that it " is clear that the government laments the war and its conduct " and that subsequent [MISC GOI  ] translations of the statement will make the intent of the government clear . 
More constructively , the document does indicate that [LOC Iceland  ] intends to continue or strengthen its humanitarian and reconstruction activities in [LOC Iraq  ] and the [LOC Middle East.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On other foreign policy issues , the new government pledges to take the lead on international environmental issues ( particularly ocean pollution and climate change ) and follow a " decisive security and defense policy . 
" A separate section on [ORG European Affairs  ] notes that the [MISC GOI  ] will establish a cross-party working group in the [ORG Althingi  ] to study issues related to [LOC Iceland  ] 's membership in the [ORG European Economic Area  ] and the " development of issues in [LOC Europe  ] " ( read: the strengthening of [ORG EU  ] institutions ) and make recommendations accordingly . 
( Comment: The [ORG SDA  ] is the only [MISC Icelandic  ] party to be openly pro-EU membership ; this appears to be a compromise to allow the [MISC IP  ] to kick this particular can further down the road while letting the [ORG SDA  ] claim they are making progress on the issue . 
) Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Post concurs with [PER FM-designate Gisladottir  ] 's assessment to the press that the new coalition represents a significant reconciliation of different viewpoints and political philosophies on the right and left . 
We add the caveat , however , that this will only be true if the whole grand enterprise stays intact for a full four-year term . 
PM [PER Haarde  ] continues to enjoy phenomenal popularity ratings hovering around 60 percent in most polls , while [PER Gisladottir  ] has consistently ranked as the " least trusted " [MISC Icelandic  ] politician over the last year . 
[PER Gisladottir  ] 's ambitions to be [LOC Iceland  ] 's first female prime minister are clear , and press and political observers are already speculating that she will attempt to force a confrontation with the [MISC IP  ] in a few years . 
In such a scenario , [PER Gisladottir  ] would hope to recruit the [MISC Progressives  ] and the [ORG Left-Green Movement  ] into a center-left coalition in which she would be prime minister. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) In the short term , we expect that [PER Gisladottir  ] will attempt to use the FM post to shore up her credibility and public standing , earning voters' trust that she can be relied upon as the nation 's [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000158 003 OF 003 leader . 
She will work to nudge [LOC Iceland  ] closer to [MISC European  ] institutions-always an objective--but for the time being we do not expect her to provoke the [MISC IP  ] on this issue . 
Although she will probably follow the [MISC Icelandic  ] pattern by making her first foreign trip to the [MISC Nordics  ] , [PER Gisladottir  ] will likely want a [LOC Washington  ] trip sooner rather than later in order to begin burnishing her credentials in the International arena. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) As he has during his first year as PM , [PER Haarde  ] will keep [MISC Icelandic-U.S.  ] relations on the front burner , particularly in defense and security affairs . 
His clear preference is for [LOC Iceland  ] to work through [ORG NATO  ] for its security , and the retention of Minister of Justice [PER Bjarnason  ] is an important signal that the PM intends to continue recent efforts to strengthen [LOC Iceland  ] 's domestic security institutions and its [ORG Coast Guard.  ] van [MISC Voorst</pre></code>  ]
