( U ) Participants [LOC U.S.  ] Under Secretary [PER Burns Ambassador Stapleton  ] P [PER Staff Bame  ] Pol Recinos ( notetaker ) [LOC France  ] MFA Political Director [PER Gerard Araud Elysee Strategic Affairs Advisor Francois Richier Elysee Americas Advisor Damien Loras  ] [ORG MOD Diplomatic Advisor Frederic Mondoloni FM Cabinet Advisor  ] [PER Philippe Errera Political  ] Director 's [PER Staff Gael  ] Veyssiere <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: U/S [PER Burns  ] and Political Director [PER Gerard Araud  ] met June 12 for a lengthy discussion of key bilateral issues , including [LOC Colombia  ] hostages , [LOC Russia  ] ( [LOC MD  ] and [ORG CFE  ] ) , [ORG NATO  ] enlargement/Georgia , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Lebanon/Syria  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and [ORG Turkey/EU  ] . 
[PER Araud  ] emphasized the new , more positive tone in the [MISC U.S.-French  ] relationship since [PER Sarkozy  ] 's election to the Presidency and affirmed that [LOC France  ] would seek to avoid airing disagreements in public . 
Prior to the meeting , [PER Burns  ] and [PER Araud  ] exchanged information on the status of [MISC French  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] hostages in [LOC Colombia  ] and agreed to consult in [LOC Paris  ] and [LOC Bogota  ] . 
[PER Araud  ] cited recent unhelpful [MISC Russian  ] statements on [ORG Missile Defense  ] and [ORG CFE  ] deployments as indicative of [LOC Russia  ] 's bluntly assertive foreign policy . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] , said [PER Araud  ] , is seeking a positive relationship with [PER Putin  ] while at the same time pressing him without immediate success on human rights and [LOC Chechnya  ] . 
[PER Araud  ] suggested that , on [ORG CFE  ] , [LOC Russia  ] might be justified in questioning the [LOC U.S.  ] troop presence in the [LOC Balkans  ] . 
The challenge is to find a middle way between complacency and confrontation in dealing with [PER Putin  ] and the new [LOC Russia  ] , [PER Araud  ] emphasized . 
[PER Burns  ] and [PER Araud  ] agreed on continued public support for [MISC Georgian  ] President [PER Sakaashvili  ] , while cautioning him against provoking the [MISC Russians  ] . 
[LOC France  ] , however , maintained strong doubts as to whether [LOC Georgia  ] has an eventual vocation as a member of [ORG NATO  ] . 
[PER Burns  ] pushed back , reminding [PER Araud  ] that we needed to safeguard democratic principles in [LOC Europe  ] by being more inclusive. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Summary cont 'd : [PER Araud  ] agreed with [PER Burns  ] on [LOC Iran  ] 's non-compliance with [ORG UNSC  ] resolutions , and on the need for an additional resolution and sanctions outside the [ORG UNSC  ] . 
[PER Burns  ] stated that a diplomatic resolution was still possible and biting sanctions likely were necessary to achieve that end . 
The [MISC French  ] registered Burns' statements that the [LOC United States  ] had proof that [LOC Iran  ] was providing arms in [LOC Iraq  ] , to the [MISC Taliban  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and to [ORG Hizballah  ] in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
[MISC French  ] Presidency advisors , however , cautioned that the evidence was not yet strong enough in [LOC Lebanon  ] to justify pressing [LOC Tehran  ] ; [LOC France  ] also did not wish to risk losing its dialogue with [LOC Iran  ] . 
On [LOC Lebanon  ] , [PER Araud  ] agreed that [LOC France  ] should have consulted the [LOC U.S.  ] prior to initiating its call for a [LOC Lebanon  ] " national dialogue " conference , and affirmed [PER Sarkozy  ] 's intention to maintain existing [MISC French  ] policy towards [LOC Lebanon  ] alongside close consultation with the [LOC United States  ] . 
On [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Araud  ] reiterated [LOC France  ] 's decision to increase its [ORG Operational Mentoring and Liaison  ] teams ( OMLTs ) from one to four , bringing the total number of [MISC French  ] trainers for the [ORG Afghan National Army  ] to over 150 personnel . 
Pressed on PRTs , a Presidential advisor said that [LOC France  ] was studying the concept and presented it to [PER Sarkozy  ] as one of several options . 
[PER Araud  ] added that [MISC European  ] support for Allied efforts in [LOC Afghanistan  ] was not open-ended . 
[PER Araud  ] also said that [PER Sarkozy  ] was seeking to decrease tensions with [LOC Turkey  ] with a proposal to move forward on those [ORG EU  ] accession chapters that would apply equally to membership and partnership status . 
[LOC Paris  ] had also informed [LOC Ankara  ] that the [ORG GOF  ] would not support a vote in the [MISC French  ] [ORG Senate  ] on a controversial resolution on [LOC Armenia  ] . 
End Summary . 
Bilateral Relationship ---------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Araud  ] began the discussion by noting that the [PER Sarkozy  ] government was opening a new period in the bilateral relationship . 
[LOC France  ] remains a good friend of the [LOC United States  ] , and will seek even closer ties with us . 
That said , [LOC France  ] will not hesitate to express disagreement when [LOC France  ] 's approach differs from that of the [LOC U.S.  ] Referring to past differences over [LOC Iraq  ] , [PER Araud  ] stated that [LOC France  ] sees no need to make our disagreements public -- we will discuss and consult first . 
[PER Araud  ] observed that former [MISC French  ] Ambassador [PER Jean-David Levitte  ] , who is [PER Sarkozy  ] 's new [ORG Diplomatic Advisor  ] , has a track record of working well with the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Burns  ] concurred , telling [PER Araud  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] had taken positive note of the new [MISC French  ] government 's decision to drop public calls for a " time horizon " for withdrawal of foreign forces from [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[LOC Colombia  ] -------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In an aside before the dinner , [PER Araud  ] described how [PER Ingrid Betancourt  ] 's release had become such an important cause in [LOC France  ] , one which President [PER Sarkozy  ] had insistently associated himself with during the presidential campaign . 
[PER Burns  ] noted that since August 2003 there had been no proof of life of the [MISC American  ] hostages in [LOC Colombia  ] . 
However , extensive interviews with the recently escaped [ORG FARC  ] prisoner had led us to believe the information he provided was credible ; there may now be grounds for believing the [LOC U.S.  ] hostages , held together with [PER Betancourt  ] , are still alive . 
[PER Loras  ] replied that based on [MISC French  ] interviews of the same escapee , the [ORG GOF  ] was skeptical . 
The information provided was far too detailed , possibly indicating it was planted -- and the whole " escape " potentially a fake . 
[PER Araud  ] and [PER Burns  ] agreed to further consultations between our missions in [LOC Bogota  ] and in [LOC Paris  ] . 
[PER Loras  ] asked that such talks begin in [LOC Paris  ] . 
[PER Araud  ] referred us to the Presidency for future consultations on this sensitive topic. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: In a follow-up conversation with [ORG Pol/MC  ] after the dinner , [PER Loras  ] was much less categorical , saying at least a week was needed to review the information concerning the hostages' well-being and whereabouts . 
We agreed to consult closely , especially with the Presidency . 
End Comment . 
[LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Missile Defense  ] and [ORG CFE  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Echoing almost verbatim his previous comments to visiting staffdel [PER Myers  ] ( ref B ) , [PER Araud  ] stated that [LOC Russia  ] has become a problem as it regresses to a traditional Czarist foreign policy -- imperialist and brutal , reflecting endemic racism , anti-Semitism and nationalism . 
By way of an example , he noted that a high-ranking member of the [ORG Duma  ] recently exclaimed to a visiting [MISC French  ] official , " so , you 've elected the [MISC Jew  ] [PER Sarkozy  ] ! 
" [PER Araud  ] also observed that [LOC Russia  ] feels besieged by [ORG NATO  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [LOC West  ] . 
Faced with the " trauma " of dealing with [LOC Chechnya  ] , and the " humiliation " of retreat from former territories during the [ORG Yeltsin  ] years , [LOC Russia  ] is unlikely to modify its imperialist foreign policy in the near future . 
Our collective challenge , emphasized [PER Araud  ] , is to find a middle way " between complacency and confrontation " in dealing with [PER Putin  ] and this " new [LOC Russia  ] . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Burns  ] said that President [PER Bush  ] sees continuing value in the relationship , especially on such important issues as fighting terrorism and wmd proliferation , and so had chosen not to respond in kind to [PER Putin  ] 's heated rhetoric . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] has deliberately refrained from reacting publicly to [PER Putin  ] 's recent provocative statements on [ORG CFE  ] , [LOC MD  ] , and other issues . 
[PER Loras  ] said that [PER Sarkozy  ] is seeking to develop a positive relationship with [PER Putin  ] , but without significant success to date . 
In their meeting , [PER Sarkozy  ] had raised with [PER Putin  ] human rights concerns , including the situation in [LOC Chechnya  ] , the violent repression of a recent gay rights parade in [LOC Moscow  ] , and the assassination of [PER Anna Politkovskaya  ] . 
[PER Putin  ] reacted by attacking human rights ( prison conditions ) in [LOC France  ] . 
Additionally , [PER Loras  ] noted that two days after [PER Sarkozy  ] had lobbied [PER Putin  ] for the purchase of [LOC Airbuses  ] , [LOC Russia  ] announced the purchase of [ORG Boeing  ] aircraft. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Araud  ] stated that [PER Putin  ] had explained to [PER Sarkozy  ] the [MISC Russian  ] proposal to locate part of the [ORG U.S. Missile Defense  ] ( [LOC MD  ] ) program in [LOC Azerbajian  ] . 
The [MISC French  ] were appreciative of the briefings General Obering had provided in [LOC France  ] , as they helped to understand better the [LOC U.S.  ] project -- and the [MISC Russian  ] response . 
The [MISC Russians  ] , [PER Araud  ] concluded , are trying to divide the Allies by questioning the [MISC Iranian  ] threat and proposing a sensible alternative to basing [LOC MD  ] defense in central [LOC Europe  ] . 
[PER Burns  ] said that the [MISC Russians  ] , in offering an [LOC Azerbajian  ] option , were , in fact , implicitly recognizing the reality of an [MISC Iranian  ] threat and the need for missile defense . 
The [LOC United States  ] , meanwhile , remains open to [LOC MD  ] coordination with [MISC NATO.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Regarding [ORG CFE  ] , [PER Araud  ] ventured that [LOC Russia  ] might have a basis for its desire for some reciprocity . 
The [MISC Russians  ] had made progress in [LOC Georgia  ] , yet we say we will never ratify until the [LOC Istanbul  ] commitments are completely fulfilled: the [ORG GOF  ] is not sure this is the best approach . 
Furthermore , the [MISC Russians  ] could argue that [LOC U.S.  ] bases in [LOC Bulgaria  ] and [LOC Romania  ] are intended not only for training , but in fact amounted to " substantial " new deployments . 
[PER Burns  ] pushed back , reminding [PER Araud  ] that [LOC Russia  ] had concurred on those basing agreements . 
[PER Araud  ] agreed that the [MISC Russians  ] were guilty of revisionist history , but the Allies nonetheless needed to offer [LOC Russia  ] a way out . 
[LOC Georgia  ] ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Turning to the then-upcoming June 13 [PER Sarkozy  ] meeting with [MISC Georgian  ] President [PER Saakashvili  ] , [PER Loras  ] commented that the Presidents had met twice before . 
In public , [PER Loras  ] added , [LOC France  ] will convey a message of " strong support . 
" Privately , however , the [MISC French  ] planned to urge [PER Sakaashvili  ] not to provoke the [MISC Russians  ] , to avoid raising tensions , and to work on the human rights situation in [LOC Georgia  ] . 
The [MISC Georgians  ] are looking to use [ORG NATO  ] as a shield ; they " should not play with fire " by baiting [LOC Moscow  ] , [PER Loras  ] emphasized . 
[PER Burns  ] said the [ORG USG  ] also had counseled [PER Sakaashvili  ] against provoking the [MISC Russians  ] , but [PER Sakaashvili  ] will be nervous until [LOC Georgia  ] has obtained [ORG MAP  ] . 
[PER Burns  ] explained that the [LOC U.S.  ] had told the [MISC Georgian  ] President that while [ORG NATO  ] 's door remains open , [LOC Georgia  ] must meet its obligations under [MISC NATO.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Voicing well-known [MISC French  ] reservations over [ORG NATO  ] membership for [LOC Georgia  ] , [PER Araud  ] questioned whether membership ultimately made sense: " [LOC Georgia  ] in [ORG NATO  ] means problems ; it should have the diplomacy of its geography . 
" He pointed to [LOC Finland  ] -- a prosperous and independent non-NATO country on [LOC Russia  ] 's border -- as a possible model . 
Presidential advisor [PER Richier  ] added that decisions on the borders of [LOC Europe  ] for the [ORG EU  ] and [ORG NATO  ] were open . 
Is [MISC Georgia-in-NATO  ] a security interest ? 
[PER Araud  ] concluded by stating that [PER Sarkozy  ] has not yet addressed [LOC Georgia  ] policy . 
[PER Burns  ] explained that the [ORG USG  ] would like to see [LOC Georgia  ] obtain [ORG MAP  ] status and eventual [ORG NATO  ] membership . 
We clearly have a different view of NATO: we see a political imperative in bringing in democracies . 
The same logic that brought the [ORG Baltics  ] into [ORG NATO  ] applies to [LOC Georgia  ] . 
[MISC Russian  ] objections should not block the membership track ; [LOC Moscow  ] should not have a veto . 
The future of [LOC Russia  ] is not readily predictable , hence the [LOC U.S.  ] would like to ensure that as much of [LOC Europe  ] is democratic and protected by [ORG NATO  ] as possible . 
[LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Araud  ] and [PER Burns  ] agreed that [LOC Iran  ] is not complying with [ORG UNSC  ] sanctions and continues to move forward with its nuclear program . 
Regarding next steps , [PER Araud  ] observed that while it may be difficult to obtain new [ORG UN  ] sanctions with more bite , [ORG UNSC  ] action nevertheless serves to provide legitimacy . 
He observed that the [MISC French  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Tehran  ] reports that [LOC U.S.  ] financial sanctions have been very effective , but that [LOC Iran  ] is not yet ready to yield to international pressure . 
In fact , the regime is in a hardening period . 
We must therefore manage the crisis for the long term ( " pour la dure " ) , and keep our nerves . 
[PER Richier  ] suggested that we should continue to seek another [ORG UNSC  ] resolution before proceeding to a review of other options including alternate sanctions -- on which [PER Sarkozy  ] would have to be consulted . 
He added that the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC France  ] should refrain from public discussion of such sanctions to avoid giving the impression , at this stage of [ORG UNSC  ] discussions , that we plan to move forward regardless of results in [LOC New York  ] . 
[PER Burns  ] reviewed his recent discussions of [LOC Iran  ] with [MISC Israeli  ] officials , nothing that they agreed with the [ORG USG  ] that there still is time for a diplomatic solution . 
Stronger sanctions and economic pressure will be essential to achieving that end . 
Other governments must be convinced of that essential point . 
Iran/Lebanon ------------ <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) [PER Burns  ] also reviewed how [LOC Iran  ] violated [ORG UNSC  ] resolutions by providing arms to [ORG Hizballah  ] in [LOC Lebanon  ] , which appears to be taking new steps to threaten [LOC Israel  ] , and to the [ORG Taliban  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Loras  ] responded that , given that the evidence on [ORG Hizballah  ] arms in [LOC Lebanon  ] is not verifiable , [LOC France  ] is not currently pushing [LOC Iran  ] on this issue . 
[PER Araud  ] added that [LOC France  ] is trying to keep open its dialogue with [PER Larijani  ] on [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
All agreed that financial sanctions remain an effective way to pressure [LOC Iran  ] to behave . 
[PER Burns  ] briefed [PER Araud  ] on the status of [MISC Iranian-American  ] hostages held by [LOC Iran  ] , and requested an appeal for their release by the [MISC French  ] Ambassador . 
[PER Araud  ] replied that he has already raised the matter with [MISC Iranian  ] authorities , and recalled that it had taken [LOC France  ] a year to obtain the freedom of a [MISC French  ] hostage in [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER Araud  ] stated that [PER Sarkozy  ] had told President [PER Bush  ] that [LOC France  ] would maintain its policy on [LOC Lebanon  ] , minus its exclusive [MISC Harriri  ] focus . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] had also solicited President [PER Bush  ] 's advice about talking with [LOC Syria  ] . 
[PER Araud  ] said [PER Sarkozy  ] responded that now is not the time , as [LOC Syria  ] remains very destructive . 
[PER Burns  ] told [PER Araud  ] that the [LOC United States  ] had been surprised at not having been consulted prior to [LOC France  ] 's recent call for a conference on [LOC Lebanon  ] in [LOC Paris  ] . 
[PER Araud  ] contritely agreed that consultations in advance were warranted . 
Returning briefly to a discussion of the renewal of [LOC UNIFIL  ] , MOD advisor Mondoloni revealed that the [MISC French  ] military would like to downsize its presence , but that civilian leaders had emphasized to them that political obligations were paramount . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] ----------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) [PER Araud  ] and [PER Richier  ] confirmed previous reporting on new [MISC French  ] commitments for [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( reftels ) . 
They emphasized that despite campaign rhetoric , [LOC France  ] is staying the course in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[LOC Paris  ] plans to increase the number of [MISC French  ] " [ORG Operational Mentoring  ] and [ORG Liaison Teams  ] ( [ORG OMLTs  ] ) , " from the current one to four , bringing the total number of [MISC French  ] personnel training the [MISC Afghan  ] Army to over 150 trainers . 
They also noted that following a review of [LOC Afghanistan  ] policy and , at the request of the Presidency , [LOC Paris  ] was reexaming how to improve [MISC French  ] assistance efforts . 
[PER Burns  ] asked about the possibility that [LOC France  ] could establish a [ORG PRT  ] , noting it was the only [ORG NATO  ] Ally not so involved . 
[PER Richier  ] admitted that [LOC France  ] is studying [ORG PRT  ] operations , but that the option of establishing one had not been raised during earlier the policy review . 
It is important to note , he added , that in contrast to previous [MISC French  ] positions , the Government is not dismissing out of hand the [ORG PRT  ] option: [PER Sarkozy  ] had still not completed the review of , or reached to final conclusions on , [LOC France  ] 's [LOC Afghanistan  ] policy. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) [PER Araud  ] reiterated the [MISC French  ] observation that [MISC European  ] governments and publics are not committed to a long-term engagement in [LOC Afghanistan:  ] there is a certain " fragility to the [MISC European  ] presence there . 
" For example , the [MISC German  ] government faces difficult battles with the [ORG Bundestag  ] every time it needs to renew its military presence there . 
" We ( [MISC Europeans  ] ) are in [LOC Afghanistan  ] to demonstrate support for the [LOC United States  ] , " [PER Araud  ] added ; [MISC Europeans  ] do see it as a vital interest of their own . 
While [LOC France  ] 's earlier call for a " contact group " had been ill-conceived , urgent but discreet Quad format discussions are needed on preparing an " exit strategy " or " success strategy . 
" Neither the [MISC Allies  ] nor the [ORG Taliban  ] can win decisively in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Araud  ] commented . 
We therefore must continue work to get the [MISC Afghans  ] to assume control of their future . 
Additionally , President [PER Karzai  ] needs to better address [MISC Pashtun  ] grievances , which fuel support for the [ORG Taliban  ] , he concluded . 
[PER Burns  ] , citing the [LOC Balkans  ] as an example , noted that the [ORG USG  ] does not believe the [MISC Allies  ] should leave [LOC Afghanistan  ] any time soon . 
[LOC Turkey  ] ------ <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) In a brief exchange on [LOC Turkey  ] , [PER Burns  ] reviewed the [ORG PKK  ] 's recent announcement that it would cease attacks , and [ORG USG  ] contacts with [LOC Ankara  ] regarding the negative impact of any cross border operation into [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[PER Araud  ] related that [PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Levitte  ] were seeking to decrease tensions with [LOC Turkey  ] by supporting [ORG EU  ] progress on 31 of the 35 accession chapters , i.e. , those chapters that would apply equally to a privileged partnership with [LOC Turkey  ] ( the other four applying only to membership ) . 
[PER Levitte  ] had explained [PER Sarkozy  ] 's position to the [LOC Turks  ] during a recent visit to [LOC Ankara  ] , where he also informed the GOT that [PER Sarkozy  ] would ensure that the [LOC Armenia  ] genocide bill would die in the [MISC French  ] [ORG Senate  ] .
