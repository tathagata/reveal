( C ) [PER Gilani  ] said that [LOC Pakistan  ] was committed to fighting extremism and pointed to the recent success of the military operations in [LOC Swat  ] , [LOC Malakand  ] and [LOC Waziristan  ] as evidence of such .

( C ) [PER Gilani  ] complained that the large number of [MISC Afghan  ] refugees living in [LOC Pakistan  ] were destabilizing the western provinces and contributing to extremism . 
[PER Gilani  ] suggested that the construction of new refugee camps in [LOC Afghanistan  ] would dramatically improve Pakistan’s security situation by halting the more than 45,000 [MISC Afghans  ] who move across the [MISC Afghanistan/Pakistan  ] border each day. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Gilani  ] also explained that capacity building for law enforcement agencies , the military and the police was an essential part of continuing the fight against extremism .

[PER Gilani  ] expressed frustration at the GOP’s inability to provide more money to support this activity due to budgetary constraints . 
He attributed these constraints to the delayed disbursement of [ORG Coalition Support Funds  ] ( [ORG CSF  ] ) , and the fact that recent pledges from the Friends of [LOC Democratic Pakistan  ] ( [ORG FODP  ] ) member countries had yet to materialize . 
[PER Gilani  ] urged the [ORG USG  ] to disburse [ORG CSF  ] funds as soon as possible .

Senator [PER Kerry  ] agreed that there was a need to expedite development efforts in these war torn areas so that efforts made by the military were not lost .

( C ) [PER Kerry  ] argued that there needed to be a two-pronged approach to tackling extremism in [MISC Pakistan:  ] military interventions needed to be coupled with economic development . 
[PER Gilani  ] agreed and said the [ORG USG  ] needed to fast track [ORG Reconstruction Opportunity Zone  ] ( [ORG ROZ  ] ) legislation , as this would provide much needed relief for the local populations . 
Highlighting the fact that a [ORG Free Trade Agreement  ] would help jump start the overall economy , [PER Kerry  ] suggested that [LOC Pakistan  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] sign an [ORG FTA  ] instead of pursuing the [ORG ROZ  ] initiative . 
However , he emphasized that in order for the [ORG FTA  ] to succeed the [MISC GOP  ] needed to openly “back the [MISC USG”  ] and ISLAMABAD 00000399 003 OF 003 counter inflammatory comments in the media and by some local politicians .
