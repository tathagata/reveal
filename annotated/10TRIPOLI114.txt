( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG SUMMARY: The Government of Libya  ] ( [ORG GOL  ] ) is continuing to expand its scholarship program funding [MISC Libyan  ] students in the [LOC United States  ] , focusing primarily on supporting [MISC Libyan  ] graduate students . 
Building on existing relationships with [LOC U.S.  ] academia dating from the 1960s and 1970s , in less than four years the [ORG GOL  ] has increased the number of [MISC Libyans  ] studying on scholarships in [LOC America  ] from zero to approximately 1,600 students . 
From the outset , [MISC Libyan  ] students faced a series of unique challenges caused by the nearly thirty-year absence of a bilateral [MISC American-Libyan  ] relationship . 
A lack of knowledge of the [LOC U.S.  ] academic system combined with a low-level of basic [MISC English  ] instruction led to a large number of [MISC Libyan  ] students returning home disappointed and without a degree . 
We view this as an opportunity to assist the [ORG GOL  ] with a mutually desired program that is fairly independent from the usual [ORG GOL  ] political interference . 
The [ORG Public Affairs and Consular Sections  ] have been able to meet with hundreds of potential [MISC Libyan  ] students over the last year and provide them with free information on educational opportunities and student visas . 
The [ORG GOL  ] has also made significant improvements in its scholarship program since 2005 including widening its pool of scholarship nominees , creating an electronic database , and hiring a [MISC Canadian  ] company to manage placement and student services . 
Overall , despite complex bureaucracy and internal change , the program continues to succeed in training a new generation of [MISC Libyan  ] professionals who will have enduring ties with the [LOC United States  ] . 
End summary . 
The [ORG GOL  ] Scholarship Program: An Overview 2 . 
( U ) Since before the 1969 [MISC Libyan  ] revolution , the [ORG GOL  ] sponsored [MISC Libyan  ] students studying abroad , including in the [LOC United States  ] . 
Current [MISC Libyan  ] Ambassador to [LOC Washington  ] [PER Ali Al-Aujeli  ] recently told journalists that over 6,000 of his countrymen had studied in [MISC American  ] institutions in the past . 
Since the resumption of bilateral relations , over 2,000 [LOC U.S.  ] student visas have been issued to [MISC Libyans  ] , with the majority being government scholarships . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] Minister of Education-equivalent reportedly ordered his department to focus on sending [MISC Libyan  ] students to the [LOC United States  ] due to the international reputation and academic superiority of [MISC American  ] academic institutions . 
Scholarship students must agree to return to [LOC Libya  ] after graduation and work in their field of study for several years . 
Many past [MISC Libyan  ] graduates of [LOC U.S.  ] institutions have gone on to senior positions within their fields of expertise , including government service ( Foreign Minister [PER Musa Kusa  ] , for example , is a graduate of [ORG Michigan State University  ] ) . 
3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In most cases , students receive funding for a year of [MISC English  ] study prior to beginning academic programs in the [LOC United States  ] . 
( Note: Due to a ban on studying foreign languages during the sanctions years , [MISC Libyan  ] students generally have limited [MISC English  ] language capabilities . 
End note ) . 
Upon completing the Test of [MISC English  ] as a Foreign Language ( [ORG TOEFL  ] ) , the students apply to [LOC U.S.  ] universities in hopes of gaining acceptance and maintaining their scholarships . 
Initially , [MISC Libyan  ] students faced a series of challenges including low acceptance rates . 
The [ORG GOL  ] estimates that from 2005 to 2008 , more than 600 [MISC Libyan  ] scholarship students returned to [LOC Libya  ] without having completed their degrees . 
The [ORG Libyan Department of Scholarships  ] now estimates that 1,000 [MISC Libyan  ] scholarship students have been accepted into academic programs in addition to another 600 currently enrolled in [MISC English  ] language programs . 
Our [ORG GOL  ] interlocutors indicate that among the lessons learned from the challenging beginning are to expand the choices of universities they recognize and to focus on hard sciences unless the student has stellar [MISC English  ] scores . 
4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG GOL  ] scholarships pay full tuition , books , and insurance as well as providing a stipend for living expenses based on family size . 
When [MISC Libyan  ] students first returned to the [LOC United States  ] , both students and institutions complained of poor service , late payments , and ill-run bureaucracy in dealing with the [ORG GOL  ] . 
The [ORG GOL  ] demonstrated some commitment to tightening control of scholarship administration when it appointed Dr. [PER Omran al-Geriani  ] as head of the [ORG Department of Scholarships  ] in May 2009 . 
The [MISC Cultural Attachi  ] at the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG People 's Bureau  ] in [LOC Washington  ] was made responsible for financing and coordinating scholarship activities in the [LOC United States  ] . 
Starting in February 2010 , and following a competitive bidding process , the task of coordinating [ORG GOL  ] scholarships throughout [LOC North America  ] will be assumed by the [ORG Canadian Bureau of International Exchange  ] ( [ORG CBIE  ] ) . 
The organization has managed the [MISC Canadian  ] portion of the [ORG GOL  ] 's program since January 2010 . 
A forthcoming delegation of members from the [ORG GOL  ] 's finance , education , and cultural wings will seek to iron out final TRIPOLI 00000114 002.2 OF 003 details including coordination among their department representatives at the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Washington  ] . 
Scholarship Selection Process 5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to [PER Al-Geriani  ] , each major ministry of the government can nominate students for scholarships . 
All nominations are then routed through the [ORG People 's Committee for Education  ] ( the largest nominating branch in its own right ) . 
Applicants usually find their names listed online within a year of application . 
They must then select where they will study , with the [LOC United Kingdom  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC Malaysia  ] , [LOC Canada  ] , [LOC Indonesia  ] , and the [LOC United States  ] being popular choices . 
The [LOC UK  ] program has reportedly reached its 4,000-student cap however , and no new [ORG GOL  ] scholarships are being offered at present . 
Unlike in previous decades , the [ORG GOL  ] issues scholarships almost exclusively for graduate and post-graduate study , due to the [ORG GOL  ] 's desire to build its own undergraduate programs . 
However , a small percentage of the top high school graduates in the country ( approximately 85 in 2009 ) receive scholarships for undergraduate study in the country of their choice . 
High school graduates who have chosen the [LOC United States  ] have been consistently in the engineering and sciences fields . 
6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Qadhafi International Charity and Development Foundation  ] ( [ORG QDF  ] ) , a quasi-governmental institution headed by [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] 's son , [PER Saif al-Islam  ] , provides another path to study abroad for those without formal government scholarships . 
After applying and being selected to received a scholarship , applicants find their names listed online at regular intervals based on the country of choice for study . 
Unlike the [ORG GOL  ] scholarship process , [ORG QDF  ] scholarships come with the school pre-designated . 
The head of the foundation 's student affairs program , Dr. [PER Taieb El-Bahloul  ] , himself a graduate of the [ORG University of California  ] at [LOC Santa Barbara  ] , told [ORG Emboffs  ] his greatest concern is the lower qualification level of his program 's awardees . 
Unlike the other nominating bodies , the foundation 's students typically have been in the work force for a number of years already and often face challenges in readapting to academia and foreign language acquisition . 
[MISC Libyan  ] students personally funding their studies in the [LOC United States  ] can also compete to pick up a government scholarship . 
Interested students must have already completed half of the coursework for their Masters or PhD program study at an approved university . 
The [ORG GOL  ] has extended this benefit to a number of [MISC Libyan-American  ] students in the [LOC United States  ] already . 
7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Personal connections lubricate many interactions in [LOC Libya  ] , and the awarding of scholarships is no exception . 
In visa interviews , a few students with government scholarships admitted to having a relative working in the scholarship division or other government body . 
In one case , an applicant presented paperwork from [ORG Georgetown University  ] stating he had a [ORG GOL  ] scholarship for six months of [MISC English  ] study only , despite being a recent high school graduate . 
He admitted that his brother-in-law , working at the [MISC Libyan  ] embassy in [LOC Washington  ] , secured him the scholarship . 
The applicant 's sister had also received a scholarship and is studying in [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC D.C.  ] as well . 
Other well-placed [MISC Libyans  ] have confirmed to [ORG Emboffs  ] that such connections can be a deciding factor in the awarding of [ORG GOL  ] scholarships . 
Despite this , the [ORG GOL  ] appears to have placed an emphasis on geographic and gender diversity in its selection process , the results of which we clearly see at the visa window when interviewing the students . 
[ORG Embassy Outreach Efforts  ] 8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Public Affairs  ] and [ORG Consular Sections  ] have worked to leverage and enhance the [ORG GOL  ] 's interest in sponsoring graduate and doctoral study in the [LOC United States  ] . 
In November 2009 , we participated in the [LOC EducationLibya Fair  ] , the country 's largest annual academic trade show . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] booth distributed [ORG IIP  ] and EducationUSA-branded material and the [ORG Embassy  ] 's educational advisor met with students and parents to offer individual counseling and advisory services . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] also organized an " [LOC America  ] 's Stage " space above the main [ORG Expo Floor  ] where [ORG Emboffs  ] provided briefings on various topics of interest to [MISC Libyan  ] students , including an overview of admissions examinations , the student visa application process , and discussions on the wide variety of academic institutions and programs available to international students . 
In November 2010 , we will organize the first-ever [ORG U.S. Educational Fair  ] in collaboration with [ORG Linden Educational Services  ] of [LOC Alexandria  ] , [LOC VA  ] . 
[ORG Al-Fateh University  ] , [LOC Libya  ] 's premier national university , has indicated preliminary interest in co-sponsoring this fair and using the opportunity to develop academic ties with [MISC American  ] institutions . 
In 2009 , TRIPOLI 00000114 003.2 OF 003 despite repeated efforts by the [ORG Embassy  ] , the [ORG GOL  ] did not issue entry visas to the [ORG State Department  ] 's [ORG Regional Educational Advising Coordinator  ] ( [ORG REAC  ] ) and [ORG Regional English Language  ] Officer ( [ORG RELO  ] ) , hampering our ability to offer pre-departure briefings and assist the [ORG Ministry of Education  ] in better preparing students for their experiences in the [LOC United States  ] . 
[ORG Public Affairs  ] and [ORG Consular  ] staff have held meetings within universities and private academic centers across the country to advocate for [LOC U.S.  ] study and provide resources and guidance . 
[ORG Second-Order Effects  ] 9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The waves of [MISC Libyan  ] students in the 1960s through early 1980s resulted in a flood of dual-national citizens , through marriages and births in the [LOC United States  ] . 
Since our reopening of [ORG American Citizen Services  ] in 2005 , [MISC Libyans  ] continue to pour in to the [ORG Embassy  ] with tattered birth certificates and supporting documents to apply for first-time [LOC U.S.  ] passports . 
Most speak little [MISC English  ] and have not visited the [LOC United States  ] since birth . 
We anticipate that the current increase in [MISC Libyan  ] students in the [LOC U.S.  ] will have a similar result. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Additionally , a number of private businesses have arisen to meet the growing demand for student visa facilitation , particularly following the opening of [LOC U.S.  ] non-immigrant visa issuance in [LOC Tripoli  ] in March 2009 . 
The largest of these businesses , [ORG Bousfeita Student Services  ] ( [ORG BSS  ] ) , boasts several offices in [LOC Benghazi  ] and [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
[MISC British-Libyan  ] owner [PER Mohamed Ali Bousfeita  ] told [PER Conoff  ] that his organization facilitated the travel of over 800 students to the [LOC United States  ] in 2008 alone , the vast majority being [MISC GOL-sponsored  ] . 
He toured 26 states to view schools and institutions to provide options for his clients and claims that study in the [LOC United States  ] has quickly overtaken the [LOC UK  ] , [LOC Australia  ] , and [LOC New Zealand  ] in popularity with [MISC Libyans  ] since [MISC U.S.-Libyan  ] diplomatic relations resumed . 
In addition , [ORG BSS  ] has been designated the sole [MISC Kaplan  ] agent for all of [LOC North Africa  ] . 
His company and others charge high fees for filing SEVIS information and fees , completing the online DS-160 [LOC U.S.  ] visa application , and scheduling the visa interview appointment . 
Students from the border city of [LOC Tobruq  ] , for example , report paying over $300 for these services . 
[LOC Tobruq  ] 's [ORG Zogogo Student Services  ] Company provides its clients with a detailed map and step-by-step procedures for the visa application process , including which windows in our Consular section provide which service , and the types of questions asked during the interview. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: In order to support [LOC Libya  ] 's growing study abroad programs , the [ORG Embassy  ] continues to see academic advising and consular outreach as top-tier priorities within the mission . 
In 2010 , we will continue to work with the [ORG Ministry of Education  ] and [MISC Libyan  ] universities to encourage [MISC Libyan  ] students to select the [LOC United States  ] as their place of study . 
The establishment of an [ORG American Center  ] , [ORG American Corners  ] , more-accessible Consular and [ORG Public Affairs  ] sections , as well as the 2010 [ORG American University Fair  ] will all help to promote the wide variety of educational opportunities that are in [LOC America  ] and provide free , accurate information about [LOC U.S.  ] visas .
