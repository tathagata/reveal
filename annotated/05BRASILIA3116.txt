( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] Undersecretary-General for Cooperation and [MISC Brazilian  ] Communities Abroad [PER Ruy Nunes Pinto Nogueira  ] called the Charge to the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] November 28 to respond to the demarche delivered by then Charge [LOC Chicola  ] on November 22 concerning the new [LOC U.S.  ] policy concerning arms transfers to [LOC Venezuela  ] ( Ref A ) . 
[PER Nogueira  ] said FM [PER Celso Amorim  ] had read the report of the November 22 meeeting when he returned from abroad , and because of the importance of the issue to [LOC Brazil  ] , asked [PER Nogueira  ] to deliver the [MISC Brazilian  ] response immediately , in place of the Secretary-General , who was out of town . 
[ORG SIPDIS  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Nogueira  ] noted that President [PER Lula  ] had raised the issue of the sale of [MISC Super Tucano  ] planes to [LOC Venezuela  ] with President [PER Bush  ] during their November 6 meeting at [LOC Granja  ] do [LOC Torto  ] in [LOC Brasilia  ] . 
He said that President [PER Bush  ] had reportedly been quite positive to the presentation , and had promised to examine the subject sympathetically . 
[PER Nogueira  ] , reading from the [MISC Brazilian  ] Government report of the November 6 session , said President [PER Bush  ] had expressed concern about the possible sale of the planes to [LOC Venezuela  ] and said there could be opposition to the sale in [ORG Congress  ] because of the high percentage of [LOC U.S.  ] components in the planes , and in view of [LOC Chavez'  ] actions . 
However , President [PER Bush  ] had concluded that " We have to be prudent . 
We don't need to take a decision right here at this table . 
" [PER Nogueira  ] said the last two sentences were a direct quote of President [PER Bush  ] 's words. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Nogueira  ] added that , after the meeting with President [PER Lula  ] , FM [PER Amorim  ] had personally provided a non-paper to Secretary [PER Rice  ] . 
[PER Nogueira  ] told the Charge that Secretary [PER Rice SIPDIS  ] had agreed to look into the matter and respond as soon as possible . 
[PER Nogueira  ] gave the Charge a copy of the non-paper in [MISC English  ] , the text of which is in paragraph six. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Nogueira  ] told the Charge that , aside from the financial concerns [LOC Brazil  ] had about the possible cancellation of the [MISC Super Tucano  ] sale , [LOC Brazil  ] believes [PER Chavez  ] has the option to buy the same , or better aircraft from other buyers , mentioning [LOC Russia  ] as an example . 
[LOC Brazil  ] would not like to see [LOC Venezuela  ] procure a plane from outside the hemisphere , and is worried that the purchase of a more advanced plane from the [MISC Russians  ] or others would cause an imbalance among the air forces of [LOC South America  ] . 
Finally , he claimed that if the sale were allowed to go forward , and the [LOC U.S.  ] and/or [LOC Brazil  ] later decided it to be no longer convenient to allow [PER Chavez  ] to deploy the aircraft , the [LOC U.S.  ] or [LOC Brazil  ] could ground the fleet by denying support and/or spare parts , just as the [LOC U.S.  ] had done in the case of the [MISC Venezuelan  ] [ORG F-16s.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Nogueira  ] concluded by saying that the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] would be tasking the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Washington  ] with obtaining a reply to the non-paper that FM [PER Amorim  ] gave to Secretary [PER Rice  ] on November 6 . 
He said instructions would be sent to the [ORG Embassy  ] on November 29. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Text of the [ORG Non-Paper: Begin Text: Sale  ] of [MISC Brazilian  ] aircraft to [LOC Venezuela  ] On Octoer 28 , 2005 , the [ORG Brazilian Aerospace Company  ] ( [ORG EMBRAER  ] ) signed a contract with the [ORG Venzuelan Air Force  ] , which provides for the sale of 20 ( twenty ) [MISC Super Tucano  ] airplanes , for [MISC US$169.7  ] million . 
The deal was conluded only after [LOC U.S.  ] parts suppliers ( which account for roughly 50 percent of the aircraft compnents ) provided written assurances that the [ORG U.S. Government  ] had nothing against the sale . 
According to unofficial information received by [ORG EMBRAER  ] , [LOC Washington  ] would be planning to review such decision . 
The cancellation of the deal wuld imply significant loss to [ORG EMBRAER  ] . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] government would highly appreciate that the [ORG U.S. Government  ] maintained its positiion on the transaction , since all conditions were met at the time of the signing of the contract . 
It is worth recalling that the Supert-Tucano airplanes are designed to provide operational support in domestic law enforcement missions , such as air space surveillance , drug trafficking and guerrilla combat , objectives that this kind of aircraft is also expected to accomplished in [LOC Colombia  ] .
