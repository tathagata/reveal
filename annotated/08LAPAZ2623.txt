( C ) Summary: [MISC Bolivian  ] President [PER Evo Morales  ] continues on the offensive against the media , part of a long-running campaign against the [MISC Bolivian  ] media . 
Through verbal and financial assaults , the [MISC Bolivian  ] Government is attempting to manipulate the way news is reported in this country . 
The [ORG GOB  ] uses financial tactics , such as hitting media with tax bills or spending large sums of money on advertising , to influence editorial lines and to create a fog about truthfulness . 
It is also using its own media to expand and reinforce a cult following around [PER Morales  ] . 
End summary . 
[ORG GOB  ] on the Attack <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The latest round of political attacks against the media ( reftel ) is part of an ongoing battle . 
President [PER Evo Morales  ] regularly calls the media his " principal opposition , " and his " enemies . 
" Notwithstanding his latest barbs , however , [PER Morales  ] usually adds that he is not against journalists , but against media owners . 
Rumors have been floating for months that in order to attempt to protect the President from his " enemies , " [MISC Venezuelan  ] investors are trying to purchase various outlets including [LOC La Paz  ] 's second-largest daily [ORG La Prensa  ] , but so far there is no evidence that any sales have been concluded. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Instead , the [ORG GOB  ] is intimidating media outlets through legal proceedings and showing favoritism in the distribution of its significant ad budget to push the press toward a more favorable view of its policies . 
In one example , the [ORG GOB  ] sent [ORG La Razon  ] , the largest newspaper in [LOC La Paz  ] , a tax bill for nearly $5 million for having " avoided taxes during 2006 . 
" High-level officials at [ORG La Razon  ] speculated to Public Affairs Section officers that this tax bill may have been an attempt to intimidate the paper to move from its generally anti-GOB editorial stance . 
The tax liability would also lower the value of the paper so that it could be sold at a lower price. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Nationalization of certain companies has also helped the [ORG GOB  ] push its press agenda forward . 
On May 1 , President [PER Morales  ] nationalized communications giant [ORG Entel  ] , one of the largest advertisers in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
The [ORG GOB  ] has been accused of using the enormous advertising budgets of the companies it has nationalized , including [ORG Entel  ] , to reward media that publish pro-GOB articles and to punish those that do not. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) With only one exception , anti-GOB television network [ORG Unitel  ] , all of the major media in [LOC Bolivia  ] accept direct paid advertising from the Government , including spots that label the media as " liars " and suggest that [MISC Bolivians  ] should not trust what they read , see , or hear from the press . 
Ironically , these same media often editorialize against the [ORG GOB  ] during the same broadcasts or in the same newspapers that carry anti-media ads . 
PAS officers have asked media directors why they continue to carry the [ORG GOB  ] ads , and all have stated that without the income it would be more difficult to survive in the very competitive market . 
Who owns the Media ? <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Although the majority of media in [LOC Bolivia  ] are privately owned , it is difficult to determine who the owners are . 
There are no public records that prove ownership , and companies or individuals who own majority stakes can sell without a public paper trail . 
There are regular rumors about the possible sale of outlets , but proof of such sales is nil and the rumors usually fade quickly. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Another issue of concern is the influence of [MISC Venezuelan  ] money in the media . 
PAS regularly hears that [MISC Venezuelan  ] businessmen are negotiating the purchase of one of the television networks ( usually cash-strapped ATB ) as well as numerous newspapers that are in financial trouble . 
Others claim it is mere speculation . 
Nevertheless , [MISC Venezuelan  ] money has built a technically stronger , pro-government , populist media network in the main [MISC Bolivian  ] cities , called Radio y [ORG Television Popular.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [LOC La Paz  ] , s second largest daily [ORG La Prensa  ] reported that [PER Morales  ] has reformed state-owned media outlets in an effort to expand the popularity and cult following of the President . 
The [ORG GOB  ] created a network of community radio stations , an internet wire agency ( [ORG ABI  ] ) , and expanded the reach of the Government-owned TV [ORG Channel  ] 7 using a $9 million donation from [LOC Venezuela  ] to install 120 repeaters . 
There are also reports that the budget for [ORG Channel  ] 7 operations has expanded by $3.8 million and that the normal procurement protocols have been dropped . 
The political opposition claims that the President is advised by a team of communications experts from [LOC Venezuela  ] as well as other countries. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Under the [PER Morales  ] administration , [ORG Channel  ] 7 , [ORG Empresa Nacional de Television  ] , has become one of the government 's primary media tools , often presenting biased and misleading information , openly propagandizing for the President and his policies , and discrediting the opposition . 
[ORG Channel  ] 7 is intent on expanding its reach and influence throughout the country . 
The manager of [ORG Channel  ] 7 announced that it is upgrading to digital technology , a costly investment by [MISC Bolivian  ] standards . 
A year ago , [ORG Channel  ] 7 announced the receipt of a donation of equipment from unknown sources to improve its reach in the departments of [LOC La Paz  ] and [PER Santa Cruz  ] , and that it had purchased 50 new repeaters to be distributed to remote locations in the west and the [LOC Amazon  ] region . 
After the [MISC Iranian  ] President 's visit to [LOC Bolivia  ] early in 2007 , some publications reported that [ORG Channel  ] 7 would get a large donation ( some reported the intended donation would be a multi-million dollar investment ) to strengthen the state TV network , but there has been no indication that this is going to materialize . 
[MISC Iranian  ] media are now reporting that the donation will be in the form of [MISC Spanish-language  ] programming . 
[ORG Channel  ] 7 also airs [MISC Venezuelan  ] Government-owned Telesur programming as part of its regular daily schedule . 
Who Owns the Print Media ? <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Two major media conglomerates appear to own most of the media in [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] group [ORG Prisa  ] ( owners of the [MISC Spanish  ] daily [ORG El Diario  ] ) owns [ORG La Razon  ] ; ATB , a private TV network ; and &Extra8 a cheap sensationalist daily . 
The other media conglomerate , the [ORG Canelas  ] and [PER Rivero families  ] , owns most of the national major dailies throughout the country . 
In [LOC La Paz  ] , they own [ORG La Prensa  ] ; in [PER Santa Cruz  ] , leading daily [ORG El Deber  ] ; in [LOC Cochabamba  ] leading daily Los Tiempos ; they also own the only daily in [LOC El Alto  ] , [LOC El Alteo  ] ; in [LOC Sucre  ] , [LOC Correo  ] del Sur ; in [LOC Potosi  ] , [LOC El Potosi  ] ; and in [LOC Tarija  ] , [LOC El Nuevo  ] Sur . 
The [ORG Canelas-Rivero Group  ] papers are generally critical of the Government . 
Other smaller , independently owned newspapers fight for ever-shrinking private-sector advertising revenues and often accept [ORG GOB  ] advertising to continue printing . 
Comment <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [LOC Bolivia  ] 's media environment is increasingly difficult . 
The [ORG GOB  ] , aided by large [MISC Venezuelan  ] investments , has used financial pressures in an attempt to change the editorial line of the media , and to hasten or provoke the sale of media outlets . 
The regular rumors about the impending sales of media may be a smoke screen to cover an actual sale , they may be a rouse to frighten the media , or they may simply be the imagination of media owners . 
It is always possible , however , that media will be sold without public knowledge , changing the opinion-leader landscape in the country . 
End comment .
