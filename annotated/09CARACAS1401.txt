[LOC CARACAS  ] 1090 [LOC CARACAS  ] 00001401 001.2 OF 002 [ORG Classified By: Political Counselor  ] Robin [PER D. Meyer  ] , for reasons 1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: In an October 28 breakfast meeting with the [ORG Confederacion de Asociaciones Israelitas Venezolanas  ] ( [ORG CAIV  ] ) Board of Directors , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , said he privately encouraged [MISC Brazilian  ] senators to allow [LOC Venezuela  ] to join [ORG MERCOSUR  ] . 
At the same time , [MISC Jewish  ] community leaders told [ORG PolCouns  ] the [MISC Venezuelan  ] government 's ( [ORG GBRV  ] 's ) attacks and " double-talk , " constant criticism of [LOC Israel  ] , growing alliance with [LOC Iran  ] , and increasing limitations on freedom of speech contribute to a heightened sense of vulnerability by the [MISC Jewish  ] community . 
End Summary. ------------------- SUPPORTING [ORG MERCOSUR  ] ------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he had spoken by phone to a [MISC Brazilian  ] senator and had privately urged the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Senate  ] on October 27 to allow [LOC Venezuela  ] to join [ORG MERCOSUR  ] , believing that membership in the organization would help promote and defend human rights . 
Given the ongoing sense of threat , [ORG CAIV  ] members agreed on the need for close relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] and other Embassies as a form of diplomatic protection for the [MISC Jewish  ] community. ------------------------ MEDIA ATTACKS SINCE 2004 ------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said " 2004 was a turning point in [LOC Venezuela  ] , " when [PER Chavez  ] began referring to support of certain [MISC Jewish  ] leaders for the 2002 post-coup government as justification for verbal and physical attacks against the [MISC Jewish  ] community and synagogues . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said anti-Semitic programs and articles have been regular features of government-owned media since 2004 , and " international anti-Jewish campaigns have been tailored for use domestically . 
" [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] emphasized that the anti-Semitism is " government-sponsored . 
" He noted that [PER Emilio Silva  ] , the author of a January 20 article on the government website aporrea.org which called for violent demonstrations at the [MISC Tiferet  ] synagogue just 10 days before the synagogue was attacked , is still teaching at the pro-government [ORG Bolivarian University of Venezuela  ] . 
They also noted that there are regular government media attacks on [PER Miranda State Governor  ] [PER Henrique Capriles Rodonski  ] as a [MISC Jew  ] , despite the fact that , while of [MISC Jewish  ] ancestry , he is [MISC Christian.  ] ---------------------------------- CONSIDERED FOREIGN , NOT [MISC VENEZUELAN  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG CAIV  ] continues to be in weekly contact with [ORG senior Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] official [PER Temir Porras  ] , and occasionally meets with Minister of [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] [PER Nicolas Maduro  ] ; they last met with him three months ago . 
They noted the irony of having the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] , rather than the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] , as their designated [ORG GBRV  ] interlocutor , which emphasizes the [ORG GBRV  ] 's view of the [MISC Jewish  ] community as " foreign " rather than [MISC Venezuelan  ] . 
While [PER Chavez  ] 's rhetoric once clearly differentiated criticism of [LOC Israel  ] from that of the [MISC Venezuelan Jewish  ] community , since 2004 they believe he has merged his anti-Zionist views with anti-Semitic ones . 
( [PER Note: Chavez  ] has adamantly denied that he or his government is anti-Semitic . 
End Note . 
) They pointed to repeated " double-talk " from the [ORG GBRV  ] , [ORG CAIV  ] had a cordial discussion with former [ORG GBRV  ] official [PER Jose Vicente Rangel  ] , and then he published a virulently anti-Semitic op-ed article ; the [ORG GBRV  ] admitted that [PER Emilio Silva  ] 's January 20 article on aporrea.org was anti-Semitic and a " mistake , " but took no action against him . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that the charge of having an arms cache , which was used as justification for the 2004 searches of the [LOC Club Hebraica  ] , has never been officially and fully resolved . 
In spite of repeated requests by [ORG CAIV  ] , court officials claim they are " unable to find the necessary documents to close the case . 
" ------------------------------------------ [LOC CARACAS  ] 00001401 002.2 OF 002 VENEZUELA'S RELATIONS WITH [LOC ISRAEL  ] AND [LOC IRAN  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Members of the [ORG CAIV Board  ] said they have felt " orphaned " since the expulsion of the [MISC Israeli  ] Ambassador and the breaking of diplomatic relations between the two countries . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] had issued a ban on visas for [MISC Israeli  ] citizens . 
While grateful that the [MISC Canadian  ] Embassy was taking on [LOC Israel  ] 's consular responsibilities ( ref C ) , many members lamented that it was taking a long time to set up the new operation . 
( [PER Note: Both  ] the [ORG CAIV  ] members and the [MISC Canadian  ] Deputy Chief of Mission have attributed the delay to the training needed by the individual [LOC Israel  ] selected to serve as its consular agent . 
The person had previously served as a receptionist at the [MISC Israeli  ] Embassy . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [LOC Israel  ] 's choice of this person was probably intended to keep [LOC Israel  ] 's profile low . 
End note . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG CAIV  ] leadership was also very concerned about the growing relationship between [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] thinks the [ORG GBRV  ] " wants to use the treatment of the [MISC Jewish  ] community in [LOC Iran  ] as a model " for [LOC Venezuela  ] , and there was widespread agreement among [ORG CAIV  ] leaders that President [PER Chavez  ] 's close alliance with [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] did not bode well for the [MISC Venezuelan Jewish  ] community . 
Many members expressed deep concern about [MISC Iranian  ] activities in the country , citing the lack of transparency at the international [LOC Maiquetia  ] airport in [LOC Caracas  ] on flights to and from [LOC Iran  ] and the suspiciously inefficient [MISC Iranian  ] factories for bicycles . 
" What are these factories really producing ? 
" asked one [ORG CAIV  ] member. --------------------------- A DETERIORATING ENVIRONMENT --------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Several [ORG CAIV  ] members noted the effect of the decreasing democratic space on freedom of religion . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that while there was freedom of religion , there was not freedom of expression . 
" When there are restrictions on freedom of speech you do not have freedom of religion , " he said . 
[ORG CAIV  ] members are also concerned about the effect of the new [ORG Education Law  ] ( ref B ) on the [MISC Jewish  ] day school . 
To a great extent , many members of [ORG CAIV  ] agreed , religious freedom cannot be separated from the general state of human rights , and " the horizon is dark . 
" Even though the number of [MISC Jews  ] in [LOC Venezuela  ] is declining as people leave the country , the threat to the community will remain , one member said , because of the prominence of many [MISC Jews  ] in business , education , and [MISC Venezuelan  ] society. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The [MISC Jewish  ] community 's quiet support for [LOC Venezuela  ] 's entry into [ORG MERCOSUR  ] suggests that it will be better protected by having [LOC Venezuela  ] part of an alliance of states pledged to the Democracy [ORG Charter  ] than by having [LOC Venezuela  ] left only to its partnership with the " revolutionary " [MISC ALBA  ] countries . 
This conclusion is similar to that expressed by opposition Mayor of [LOC Caracas  ] [PER Antonio Ledezma  ] ( ref A ) , who told [MISC Brazilian  ] legislators that [PER Chavez  ] was more dangerous isolated than if brought into an organization of democratic countries .
