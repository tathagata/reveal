( C ) Summary: Interior Minister [PER Dominique de Villepin  ] 's cabinet advisor on the police said March 15 that the [MISC French  ] security establishment is going through a period of " synthesis , " in which reforms proposed over the past decades are gradually finding their place within standard operating procedure . 
He said [LOC France  ] remains as focused " as ever " on combating terrorism , but that the latitude offered terrorism investigating judges in the 1980s and 1990s may be waning due to the country 's increasing distance from periods when terrorists repeatedly struck on [MISC French  ] soil . 
Regarding violence in [MISC French  ] society , he said virtually all acts of violence and criminality were on the decrease , except for troubling increases in the amount of rapes and " gratuitous violence . 
" End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On March 15 , [PER Poloff  ] met with [PER Jerome Leonnet  ] , the " technical counselor " in Interior Minister [PER Villepin  ] 's cabinet in charge of " the organization and administration of police/terrorism/relations with [ORG Renseignements Generaux  ] " ( [LOC France  ] 's police intelligence agency ) . 
[PER Leonnet  ] has been in [PER Villepin  ] 's cabinet since summer 2004 . 
He said he previously worked for seven years with the DST ( [LOC France  ] 's internal security service ) , seven years with [ORG Renseignements Generaux  ] , and a number of years with the [ORG Prefecture of Police  ] in [LOC Paris.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Leonnet  ] described the 1980s and 1990s as decades of great turmoil within the security establishment . 
He said that terrorism attacks during that period , especially in [LOC Paris  ] during the mid-1980s , fed a perception among [MISC French  ] citizens that the security establishment was relatively helpless to stop terrorism . 
In addition , in the late 1990s , [LOC France  ] underwent a significant rise in violent crimes , something it had not experienced before . 
In response , the [ORG GOF  ] instituted a number of different laws , including the famous " terrorist conspiracy " law , to give more freedom of action to its security services . 
This period of reform lasted through 2004 , said [PER Leonnet  ] , with the passage of [PER Perben II  ] , an omnibus legal reform bill ( reftel ) . 
Pointing to two thick red books of criminal law on his shelf , [PER Leonnet  ] said that [LOC France  ] had no more need of new laws ; what was needed now was bureaucratic implementation , streamlining and coordination . 
[PER Leonnet  ] expected this period of " synthesis " to continue for the next few years , with a particular focus on training and crisis-response . 
He also addressed the oft-debated idea to combine the DST and RG intelligence services . 
It was a bad idea , said [PER Leonnet  ] , because each service had different goals and competencies , and when any mixing of dossiers occurred , it was quickly ironed out through the interagency process. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Turning to terrorism , [PER Leonnet  ] said he expected that getting convictions with the " terrorist conspiracy " charge ( used to great effect from the 1980s onward ) will become more difficult for [LOC France  ] 's terrorism investigating judges . 
Initially , said [PER Leonnet  ] , investigating judges like [PER Jean-Louis Bruguiere  ] were given enormous leeway in the conduct of their investigations . 
Standards of proof for " terrorist conspiracy " were much lower than standards in other criminal cases . 
However , said [PER Leonnet  ] , the level of evidence required for " terrorist conspiracy " convictions is on the increase . 
Terrorism investigating judges will need more evidence than was necessary before . 
[PER Leonnet  ] described this evolution as a natural progression away from the reactive policies of the 1980s and 1990s that takes into account current realities , in which the memory of actual terrorist acts has grown distant and the demand for civil liberties has become stronger . 
Still , he considered [MISC French  ] citizens sensitized to terrorism and aware that [LOC France  ] remained a prime target for terrorists. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Asked to comment on a newspaper article in early February drawing on [ORG Renseignement Generaux  ] sources that reported [MISC Islamist  ] radicals controlled approximately 40 mosques/prayer halls in [LOC France  ] and numbered approximately 500 militants and 5000 sympathizers , [PER Leonnet  ] said the estimates were correct . 
There had clearly been an increase in radical [MISC Islam  ] in [LOC France  ] over the past few years , said [PER Leonnet  ] . 
Nonetheless , he was optimistic that the long-term trend towards radical [MISC Islam  ] would begin to decline . 
Citing efforts by the [ORG GOF  ] such as ensuring that all imams spoke [MISC French  ] , close surveillance of mosques and troubled neighborhoods by police and security services , the " veil " law , and a determination from President [PER Chirac  ] on down to foster integration , [PER Leonnet  ] said the [ORG GOF  ] was well aware of its challenges regarding the spread of radical [MISC Islam  ] , and it was taking the necessary steps. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In any case , said [PER Leonnet  ] , the issues of integration and immigration had no effect on criminal violence . 
He said that over the past few years , incidents of violence and criminality have been on the decrease . 
Violence perpetrated by immigrants usually has a financial or social goal , said [PER Leonnet  ] , and those types of crimes have gone down . 
The two exceptions were cases of rape and " gratuitous violence . 
" On the increase in rapes , [PER Leonnet  ] speculated that the wide diffusion of pornographic films on cable television was an important contributing factor . 
Regarding " gratuitous violence , " or violence committed with no goal in mind , [PER Leonnet  ] said that societal structures that previously weeded out and controlled such behavior no longer played the same role . 
Mandatory military service was gone , as was full employment and cohesive family structures , all of which contributed to identifying individuals with a propensity towards gratuitous violent acts .
