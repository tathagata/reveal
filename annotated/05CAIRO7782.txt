( C ) In a September 28 meeting with [ORG PDAS  ] [PER Elizabeth Cheney  ] , [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] , head of the [ORG NDP Policies Committee  ] , reviewed his father 's presidential election campaign , which he argued had been a major success . 
He also reviewed the ruling party 's preparations for the upcoming parliamentary elections . 
[ORG PDAS Cheney  ] reminded [PER Gamal  ] of the paramount importance that the [ORG USG  ] places on international monitoring and urged him to use his influence to encourage the GOE/NDP to undertake other concrete improvements in the electoral process . 
Significant improvements in the parliamentary elections , the [ORG PDAS  ] noted , would be crucial to continuing [LOC Egypt  ] 's democratic reform progress . 
End summary. --------------------------------------------- ---- The [ORG NDP  ] 's Campaign Architect Reviews His Creation --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG PDAS  ] [PER Cheney  ] , joined by [PER DAS Carpenter  ] , Charge , and poloff ( notetaker ) met with [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] on September 28 to discuss [LOC Egypt  ] 's political reform progress . 
[PER Gamal  ] opened the meeting with questions about [PER Hurricanes Katrina  ] and [PER Rita  ] . 
[ORG PDAS Cheney  ] updated [PER Gamal  ] on cleanup and recovery efforts and thanked him for [ORG GOE  ] relief supplies . 
The Charge noted that [LOC Washington  ] had been gratified by the speed of the [ORG GOE  ] airlift to supply water , blankets , and other items. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Turning to the September 7 presidential election , [PER Gamal  ] noted that he and his [ORG NDP  ] colleagues had been working on the campaign since the end of June , when President [PER Mubarak  ] had indicated that " he wanted a proper campaign team . 
" [PER Gamal  ] said the team , which included [PER Ahmad Ezz  ] and [PER Mohammad Kamal  ] , used focus groups and polling to fine tune the President 's message . 
After the campaign team devised a " credible program , " which the [ORG NDP  ] " simplified " to address focus group concerns , the party used the campaign period ( August 17-September 3 ) to reach out to voters. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Gamal  ] noted that his father had directed the party to " run a positive campaign , " and to respond only to attacks that misrepresented policy . 
[PER Gamal  ] attributed the [ORG NDP  ] 's success to a packed schedule of campaign events ( nearly one major event per day ) along with [ORG DVC  ] outreach to provincial party leaders , and personal letters from the President to each of the party 's 7000 " basic unit leaders " ( i.e. , precinct bosses ) . 
According to [PER Gamal  ] , the precinct bosses were " absolutely crucial " and the " backbone " of an effort to " fire up " youthful [ORG NDP  ] voters . 
In response to a question by the [ORG PDAS  ] , [PER Gamal  ] said that his father had much enjoyed the " intensity " of the campaign as well as his engagement with party activists . 
[PER Gamal  ] said that the final event of the campaign , the closing rally at [LOC Abdeen Palace  ] in [LOC Cairo  ] , had been a " big success , " since it linked the President to key episodes in [MISC Egyptian  ] historical memory. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG PDAS  ] noted the [ORG USG  ] 's continuing encouragement of the [ORG GOE  ] to invite international observers , and pressed [PER Gamal  ] to identify areas that he though could be improved in future elections . 
[PER Gamal  ] described [LOC Egypt  ] 's outdated and incoherent voter lists as " not a huge issue , " but noted that cleaning them up would be a long-term project . 
He blamed the low turnout of the presidential election ( about 7 million voters or 23 percent ) on overzealous judges supervising the September 7 ballot who had , allegedly , refused to allow more than one voter at a time into polling stations , and thereby diminished turnout . 
" We were aiming for at least nine million voters , but many people went home without voting because of the queues , " [PER Gamal  ] said. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Gamal  ] termed the controversy over domestic observers on election day as " a huge mess , " and noted that the party had tried to play a constructive role on this issue , behind the scenes , despite the obstructionism of the [ORG Presidential Election Commission  ] and some of the judges . 
The [ORG PDAS  ] reiterated the [ORG USG  ] 's views on international monitors and urged him to use his influence in support of both international and domestic monitors. ------------------------------------- Plans for the Parliamentary Elections ------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Turning to the parliamentary elections , which will be held in three stages beginning on November 8 , [PER Gamal  ] said that a central difference with the presidential campaign would be that campaigning for the 444 parliamentary races " would be the party 's effort , not the President 's . 
" The President plans to campaign on behalf of some candidates , however and the Party plans to use the same [LOC Heliopolis  ] campaign headquarters and core team , although this team will be " adjusted for the battle . 
" <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The [ORG PDAS  ] asked how the party plans to select its candidates . 
[PER Gamal  ] noted that the party 's selection process hadn't worked in the past , since it permitted candidates with deep pockets to win the party endorsement even if they were not able to win at the polls . 
( Note: In the 2000 elections , official [ORG NDP  ] candidates won less than 40 percent of the seats . 
Most winners were so-called " [ORG NDP  ] independents " who had not managed to secure the party 's endorsement but nevertheless prevailed at the poll and eventually rejoined the party , thereby giving the [ORG NDP  ] its lock on Parliament . 
End note . 
) <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Gamal  ] provided an overview of the new process . 
He said that the party would hold " primaries " during the first week of October , which would assemble precinct bosses and other grass roots leaders to bet potential candidates . 
[PER Gamal  ] said that in addition to this popularity contest , the party would use polling , analysis of the voting in the presidential election , and a " software " analysis to create a single consolidated party slate of candidates. ------------------------------------------- But How [MISC Will They Be Better  ] than Last Time ? ------------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Gamal  ] said that the parliamentary elections would be " both messier and easier " than the presidential election . 
The [ORG PDAS  ] pressed [PER Gamal  ] to suggest steps that the [ORG GOE  ] could take in the next few weeks to demonstrate its commitment to political reform . 
In response to the [ORG PDAS  ] 's inquiry about the [ORG GOE  ] utilizing transparent ballot boxes in place of the existing wooden boxes , [PER Gamal  ] described them as " cosmetic . 
" For [LOC Egypt  ] , he said , the key is judicial supervision . 
[PER Gamal  ] also dismissed alleged problems with indelible ink , multiple voting , and voting by unregistered citizens . 
All of these allegations , he said , were " unfounded . 
" <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) More important , he argued had been the information deficit . 
Voters had sometimes not known which polling stations to report to , and the lists of registered voters had not been widely available ahead of time . 
Improving the available information about the polling station locations and access was [PER Gamal  ] 's highest priority . 
" If I was in charge , " he said , " this is what I 'd do . 
" <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The [ORG PDAS  ] ask [PER Gamal  ] about the period after the parliamentary election . 
He replied that [LOC Egypt  ] 's unregistered voters were now excited about politics and enthusiastic to register to vote in future elections , when the registration period opens in late 2005 . 
The [ORG PDAS  ] asked if any opposition party would get the five percent of the parliamentary seats need to field a future presidential candidate . 
[PER Gamal  ] shrugged and replied that this would depend on the opposition parties' organization and discipline . 
Might the [ORG GOE  ] revise [ORG Article  ] 76 again , the [ORG PDAS  ] asked , if an opposition party failed to get the required five percent ? 
[PER Gamal  ] replied that talk of additional modification of [ORG Article  ] 76 was premature: " the ink is not yet dry , " he said. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) He also argued that the special candidacy rules in 2005 , to encourage multiple presidential candidates , could not be extended in future elections . 
The somewhat less restrictive rules for 2005 had been necessary , he said , as an incentive to the parties to " get their acts together . 
" In the long term , however , encouragement of fringe candidates who do not have significant parliamentary representation would be a recipe for " chaos . 
" <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The [ORG PDAS  ] sought [PER Gamal  ] 's views on rumors that the President plans to appoint a vice president . 
[PER Gamal  ] professed ignorance on the subject . 
Should the President appoint a VP , the [ORG PDAS  ] asked . 
[PER Gamal  ] paused for a moment then said some people argue the President should name a Vice President , while others say that the new amendment to the Constitution makes a vice president unnecessary . 
[PER Gamal  ] said , " I listen to both arguments . 
" -------------- A Man in Full ? -------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) At [PER Gamal  ] 's invitation , the [ORG PDAS  ] and [ORG DAS  ] later attended the gala reception on September 29 hosted by the [ORG NDP  ] for the diplomatic corps on the occasion of the party 's annual conference . 
Members of the diplomatic corps , including the [MISC Iranian  ] Ambassador , gathered around [PER Gamal  ] vying for his attention and the opportunity to shake his hand . 
Party old-guard figures [ORG Kemal  ] al-Shazli and [PER Safwat Sherif  ] stood together off to the side while [PER Gamal  ] was clearly the center of the show . 
Minister of Tourism , [PER Ahmed Maghrabi  ] , told the [ORG PDAS  ] that members of the new guard received loud and prolonged applause whenever they took the podium at the party congress . 
The reception for old guard figures , by contrast , was muted and polite . 
Judging from this , [PER Maghrabi  ] said , " I don , t think the old guard will be with us much longer . 
" <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) [ORG PDAS  ] Cheney cleared this message .
