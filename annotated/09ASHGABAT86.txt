( C ) During a January 18 conversation with [PER XXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] shared the following comments about [ORG Bouygues  ] 's relations with the [MISC Turkmen  ] government and its business prospects in the country: -- It is well known in the company that Minister of Construction , [PER Shamuhammet Durdylyev  ] , and former Minister of Communications , [PER Resulberdi Hojagurbanov  ] , do not like [ORG Bouygues  ] . 
While Pupulin did not know why these officials , particularly [PER Durdylyev  ] , dislike [ORG Bouygues  ] , company employees have the impression that there is a negative trend developing . 
As more and more ministers develop an aversion to the company , the company will eventually leave [LOC Turkmenistan  ] . 
-- To illustrate the excessive scale of the buildings that house [MISC Turkmen  ] government ministries , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained that 170 employees will work in the new [ORG Ministry of Communications  ] building -- which contains 15,000 square meters of floor space . 
-- [PER XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] mentioned that [ORG Bouygues  ] is currently constructing a building for the " [ORG Protocol Department  ] , " adding that the government might need this building for a meeting of the [ORG Commonwealth of Independent States  ] that will take place in [LOC Ashgabat  ] in early 2010 . 
He added that this meeting might also be the stimulus for the five-star hotel that [ORG Bouygues  ] is building , as well as the new [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] building . 
-- Payment delays can also hold up the commencement of new projects and postpone continuation of work already in progress ( reftel ) . 
Problems locating cement domestically -- which , while cheaper , is not the best quality -- also negatively impact the project cycle. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [ORG Bouygues  ] Regional Director [PER Charles Santer  ] and Commercial Director for [LOC Central Asia  ] Aleksy Reshov met with President [PER Berdimuhamedov  ] on January 16 . 
Reshov updated [PER Berdimuhamedov  ] on current projects in a meeting on January 16 , especially interior design of the five-star hotel under construction . 
They also discussed future cooperation. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) COMMENT: Notoriously secretive and insular due to fears of commercial espionage , information about Bouygues' activities has been one of the toughest nuts to crack in [LOC Turkmenistan  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's comments appear to be further confirmation of [ORG Bouygues  ] 's troubles in [LOC Turkmenistan  ] . 
END COMMENT .
