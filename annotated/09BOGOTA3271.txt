Brownfield  ] , Ambassador ; REASON: 1.4 ( B ) , ( C ) , ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [ORG PolCouns  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX Colombia  ] DeskOfficer on October 21 that the analysis of cell phone calls made by the six signers of mala fide judicial telephone intercept orders ( see reftels ) submitted to the [LOC Prosecutor General  ] 's Office pointed to an individual named [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had received phone calls from [PER Juan Carlos Arzayuz  ] --former [ORG DAS  ] Director [PER Andres Penate  ] 's Deputy for Intelligence-- who was arrested in July along with seven other former officials of the [ORG Administrative Department of Security  ] ( [ORG DAS  ] ) in relation to the wiretap scandal . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the hypothesis is that [PER Arzayuz  ] instructed [PER Monsalve  ] to record [ORG Supreme Court  ] auxiliary magistrate [PER Ivan Velazquez  ] and leak the tape to " Semana " news magazine . 
The ruse , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained , was intended to exculpate theimprisoned [PER Arzayuz  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the circumstances suggested this was not the first time that [PER Arzayuz  ] and [PER Monsalve  ] had conspired to conduct illegal wiretaps , though authorities had no developed any hard evidence. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) At the time of [LOC Arzayuz'  ] arrest , he was working at the [LOC Prosecutor General  ] 's [ORG Investigate Corps  ] ( [ORG CTI  ] ) . 
[PER Arzayuz  ] made the switch from [ORG DAS  ] to [ORG CTI  ] , which [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] found odd given the difference in institutional cultures , when [PER Maria  ] del [PER Pilar Hurtado  ] replaced [PER Penate  ] as [ORG DAS  ] Director in August 2007 . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the CNP had not yet arrested [PER Monsalve  ] , but had him under surveillance to uncover more of his criminal connections . 
Though he had no proof , and at this time it was his mere conjecture , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he suspected [PER Uribe  ] 's Secretary of the Presidency [PER Bernardo Moreno  ] and possibly advisor [PER Jose Obdulio Gaviria  ] had ordered the illegal surveillance . 
XXXXXXXXXXX said he would pursue the investigation wherever it leads. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) COMMENT: This falls in the category of informed speculation , but speculation from [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] has a pretty good track record for success .
