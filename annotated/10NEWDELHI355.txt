[PER Menon  ] confirmed the government would introduce civil nuclear liability legislation in the next [ORG Parliament  ] . 
END SUMMARY . 
[PER Menon  ] Touts “Full-spectrum” Relationship , Discusses Pune Bombing - - - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a wide-ranging meeting with CODEL McCaskill February 17 , [ORG National Security Advisor Shivshankar Menon  ] touched on several regional security and trade-related issues . 
Whereas the [MISC U.S.-India  ] relationship used to be too narrow , [PER Menon  ] said we now had the opposite problem , a “full-spectrum” relationship touching on virtually every area of life , with correspondingly high expectations for what we can accomplish together. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Menon  ] welcomed the condolences offered by Senator [PER Claire McCaskill  ] ( [MISC D-MO  ] ) for the February 13 bombing in Pune that killed 10 and injured dozens . 
The bombing was “a shock , yet not shocking , ” considering [MISC India’s  ] familiar experience as a terrorist target . 
[PER Menon  ] credited intelligence shared by the [LOC United States  ] with helping prompt the [MISC Indian  ] government to protect targets in the vicinity of the attack , such as the [ORG Chabad House  ] and [PER Osho Ashram  ] , perhaps leaving the terrorists no alternative but to go after a soft target instead . 
Three groups had claimed responsibility , but the government had not come to any conclusions about the perpetrators . 
In [MISC India’s  ] long history of dealing with terrorism , [PER Menon  ] said , “Most attacks lead back to [MISC Pakistan.”  ] “Many Pakistans” - - - <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Menon  ] recounted that [LOC India  ] had entered into the [ORG Composite Dialogue  ] with [LOC Pakistan  ] on the basis of former [MISC Pakistani  ] President [PER Pervez Musharraf’s  ] assurance that [LOC India  ] would not be targeted by terrorists as long as the talks continued . 
This dialogue process entered into a pause in 2007 at [PER Musharraf’s  ] request when he was faced with difficult domestic challenges , which ultimately led to his ouster . 
Since then , [LOC India  ] endured serial bombing attacks throughout 2008 , two attacks on its embassy in [LOC Kabul  ] ( one he attributed to the [ORG Haqqani Network  ] and the other to [LOC Lashkar-e-Tayiba  ] ) , and then the November 26 , 2008 attacks in [LOC Mumbai  ] , known as NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00000355 002 OF 004 “26/11.” [PER Menon  ] lamented that [LOC Pakistan  ] had shown itself to be “unable or unwilling to wean itself off from terror as an instrument of state policy.” He alluded to evidence that serving [MISC Pakistani  ] officials were involved in the 26/11 attacks. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Menon  ] shared his perspective that “We are dealing with many [MISC Pakistans  ] , so we need to run many [LOC Pakistan  ] policies at the same time.” He stressed that even after the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks [LOC India  ] did not sever trade or travel ties with [LOC Pakistan  ] because these elements of the relationship were important to achieving an eventual peace with [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
As a “true democracy , ” public opinion defined the limits of [MISC India’s  ] forebearance , but [PER Menon  ] stressed that [LOC India  ] did not wish to play into the hands of the terrorists by shunning dialogue. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Terrorism would be “the primary issue” in the planned February 25 Foreign Secretary-level talks , but [PER Menon  ] allowed that after the first talks “it will be up to the [MISC Pakistanis  ] how they respond.” A peaceful , stable [LOC Pakistan  ] was in [MISC India’s  ] national interest , which was “why we keep trying.” [PER Menon  ] confessed that the [MISC Indian  ] government’s expectations for talks today were lower than when [LOC India  ] had entered into talks with [LOC Pakistan  ] in the past because “We don’t think [LOC Pakistan  ] is capable of delivering much , but what’s the alternative ? ” He concluded , “A peaceful , stable [LOC Pakistan  ] is in our interest ; we will work at it even if they make it hard for us.” Afghanistan: [PER Menon  ] a “Minority of One” - - - <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Turning to Pakistan’s role in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Menon  ] cautioned that if the [MISC Pakistani  ] establishment felt [LOC U.S.  ] commitment was flagging in [LOC Afghanistan  ] it would “sit it out and use the [MISC Indian  ] threat as an excuse for not doing what was needed” in the [LOC West  ] . 
[PER Menon  ] said he may be a “minority of one , ” but he thought there was more potential for success in [LOC Afghanistan  ] than most observers in [LOC India  ] . 
The [MISC British  ] were convinced the [ORG Coalition  ] would lose because they lost three wars there , but others had been able to tame the country . 
[PER Menon  ] trumpeted [MISC India’s  ] assistance program of small , community-based projects , saying it took [MISC Indian  ] officials one-and-a-half years to navigate around the ministries in [LOC Kabul  ] to get direct access to local people , but it had paid off enormously . 
He cited one instance in which 13,000 [MISC Afghans  ] had applied for exams to qualify for [MISC Indian  ] scholarships ; not all of them were qualified , but it showed how strong the desire was for such opportunities . 
He concluded that success will require “more than just a military effort.” <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER McCaskill  ] agreed we had a chance to succeed because we had adjusted our strategy . 
[PER McCaskill  ] was confident the [LOC United States  ] would continue to sustain the 300,000 strong [ORG Afghan National Security Forces  ] even if we began to draw down troops in 2011 . 
[PER Menon  ] observed that “the wonder of the [LOC U.S.  ] system is how quickly you learn ; that cannot be said of any other country in the world.” [ORG Iran:  ] A Choice Among “Unsatisfactory Strategies” - - - <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Menon  ] agreed with Senator [PER Jeff Merkley’s  ] ( D-OR ) assertion that a nuclear [LOC Iran  ] would be bad for everyone . 
Merkley had supported the [PER Obama Administration’s  ] efforts to seek dialogue with [LOC Iran  ] , but it was now clear the [LOC Islamic Republic  ] was not open to dialogue . 
[PER Menon  ] replied that “the last thing we want is another nuclear power in our neighborhood.” That was why [LOC India  ] voted against [LOC Iran  ] three times at the [ORG IAEA  ] and implemented [ORG UN  ] sanctions . 
[LOC Iran  ] was NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00000355 003 OF 004 “hopping mad” over [MISC India’s  ] [ORG IAEA  ] votes and [MISC Iranian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Moutakki  ] “blew up” at former [ORG National Security Advisor M.K. Narayanan  ] during his last visit to [ORG Delhi.  ] “It goes without saying , ” according to [PER Menon  ] , that [LOC India  ] would continue to implement any sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] approved by the [ORG Security Council.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [LOC India  ] had a more complex relationship with [LOC Iran  ] and was convinced that it could work with [LOC Iran  ] on some issues . 
For instance , [PER Menon  ] asserted that [LOC Iran  ] was more worried about the [ORG Taliban  ] today than [LOC ISAF  ] , which was not the case a year ago . 
The trouble was that the [MISC Iranian  ] elite was divided , so the normal rules of [MISC Iranian  ] politics no longer seemed to apply . 
Under these circumstances , [PER Menon  ] asked , “What effect will sanctions have ? ” “If you must impose sanctions , we will go along with it , ” according to [PER Menon  ] , “but we should be aware that it could end up benefiting the regime.” He said any sanctions should be carefully targeted so they do not end up hurting the people rather than the elite . 
He concluded that the [LOC Iran  ] situation was “very unsatisfactory from our point of view as well , ” and that the [LOC United States  ] had “a choice among unsatisfactory strategies.” [ORG Trade Issues: Fighters  ] , [ORG Export Controls  ] , [PER Civ Nuke  ] , [ORG GM Foods  ] - - - <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Menon  ] said he appreciated all that the [LOC India  ] and the [LOC United States  ] had been able to accomplish together , and said we needed to do more on defense cooperation . 
[PER McCaskill  ] remarked about the [ORG Boeing  ] presence in [LOC St. Louis  ] and inquired about the [MISC MMRCA  ] fighter tender . 
[PER Menon  ] said the technical evaluations would wrap up in April and the tender would be awarded following a fair process . 
He added that the [MISC C-17  ] deal was almost done and only a few “loose ends” needed to be tied up. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) “In order to kick the relationship into a different gear , ” according to [PER Menon  ] , we needed “to be seen to be sharing technology.” We both have complex legal and regulatory structures , some left over from the [MISC Cold War  ] , “ancient stuff.” It could take years to change this , but we have to try . 
[PER McCaskill  ] agreed , suggesting the possibility of using the annual [ORG Defense Authorization Legislation  ] , which moves through [ORG Congress  ] annually “like clockwork , ” to eliminate “legislative handcuffs.” [PER Menon  ] said he would ask the [MISC Indian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Washington  ] to be in touch with McCaskill’s staff to walk them through [MISC India’s  ] proposed changes. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Merkley praised Menon’s role in helping to conclude the [ORG Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement  ] , and inquired about progress on implementation . 
[PER Menon  ] mentioned planned Reprocessing Consultations March 2-4 in [LOC Delhi  ] , adding , “If we could accomplish the 123 Agreement , I don’t see how this can stop us.” [PER Menon  ] said unequivocally , “We’re introducing liability legislation to the next [ORG Parliament.”  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER McCaskill  ] noted that if there is one issue with regard to [LOC India  ] that makes [MISC Americans  ] “cranky” it is that [LOC India  ] was stealing our manufacturing base . 
Pointing out that [ORG Monsanto  ] was also located in [LOC Missouri  ] , she conceded that genetically modified foods were controversial , but noted that the [LOC United States  ] purchased [MISC Indian  ] [ORG GM  ] cotton . 
[PER Menon  ] said we were just catching “the peak of the wave” on this issue in [LOC India  ] , noting that the papers were full of vigorous arguments on both sides . 
He thanked [PER McCaskill  ] for reminding him that in difficult economic times these issues had the potential to take on added proportion in the relationship. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Codel [PER McCaskill  ] did not have the opportunity to clear this cable .
