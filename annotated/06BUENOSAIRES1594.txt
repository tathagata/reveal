End Summary. ------------------------- KIRCHNER'S MANY SUCCESSES ------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Coming to power after one of the worst economic , political and social crises in [LOC Argentina  ] 's history , President [PER Nestor Kirchner  ] has had a successful first three years in office . 
When [PER Kirchner  ] first took office in May 2003 , many analysts doubted he would finish his term . 
Since that time , [PER Kirchner  ] has gained full control of the [ORG Peronis Party  ] ( [ORG PJ  ] ) , asserted his authority over the military , largely co-opted the piquetero movement that threatened the stability of past governments , won control of [ORG Congress  ] in the October 2005 elections and maintained high public approval ratings . 
Not only is [PER Kirchner  ] 's survival no longer in doubt , polls show that [PER Kirchner  ] would easily win reelection if elections were held today . 
[PER Kirchner  ] controls [LOC Argentina  ] 's political system and faces a weak and divided opposition . 
[PER Kirchner  ] has also proven adept at the traditional [MISC Peronist  ] art of co-opting key elements of the opposition , including a majority of the opposition governors. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) He is seen as a strong and decisive leader and is credited with restoring governability to the executive branch and promoting [LOC Argentina  ] 's impressive economic recovery . 
Polls show that the [MISC Argentine  ] public views [PER Kirchner  ] as a decisive leader who was able to take charge and turn the country around during a difficult time in [MISC Argentine  ] history . 
The wave of public demonstrations that stemmed from the 2001-2002 economic crisis that brought presidential authority in [LOC Argentina  ] to one of its lowest ebbs has subsided and [PER Kirchner  ] has adeptly managed relations with protest leaders . 
On the economic front , [LOC Argentina  ] has strongly rebounded from the crisis , with GDP growth rates of 9 percent for the past [ORG BUENOS  ] AIR 00001594 002 OF 005 three years . 
Through the [ORG GOA  ] 's private sector debt deal and by paying off [LOC Argentina  ] 's [ORG IMF  ] debt , [LOC Argentina  ] 's external debt has been brought to a manageable level for the first time in a decade . 
Under [PER Kirchner  ] 's watch , [LOC Argentina  ] has amassed record budget surpluses . 
The tax collection system -- a perennial problem for [MISC Argentine  ] governments -- has been significantly improved , albeit aided by the use of distortionary taxes like the financial transaction tax and the export tax . 
[LOC Argentina  ] 's move to a market-based exchange rate regime in 2002 has triggered an export-led boom during [PER Kirchner  ] 's presidency that has been the driving factor behind robust growth , accompanied by significant declines in unemployment and poverty levels. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Kirchner  ] has high public approval ratings and has restored public optimism in [LOC Argentina  ] . 
[PER Kirchner  ] 's approval ratings stand at 65-75 percentage points -- depending on the poll and how the question is asked -- a historical high for an [MISC Argentine  ] president three years into his term . 
Polls by leading [MISC Argentine  ] pollsters show that [PER Kirchner  ] receives high marks for his handling of the economy and for promoting political stability . 
[MISC Argentines  ] also have developed a renewed sense of optimism under [PER Kirchner  ] 's administration . 
In recent polling by a leading opinion research firm , a plurality of respondents -- 44 percent -- thought that conditions in [LOC Argentina  ] would improve over the coming year , while only 12 percent thought things would get worse . 
In March 2003 , the month [PER Kirchner  ] was elected , polling by the same firm showed that only 29 percent of the population thought things would get better in the coming year , while 30 percent thought things would get worse. ----------------- CHALLENGES REMAIN ----------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Despite these major successes , [PER Kirchner  ] continues to face considerable challenges in dealing with persistent poverty and high crime . 
Poverty rates have been nearly halved from almost 60 percent of the population at the height of the economic crisis to 34 percent today . 
At the same time , however , reducing poverty in this traditionally affluent country continues to be a major social policy imperative for the [PER Kirchner  ] administration . 
The continued problem of inflation -- which stood at 12.3 percent in 2005 and is on track to maintain a double digit rate in 2006 -- is also of a top [ORG GOA  ] concern . 
The [ORG GOA  ] has resorted to price controls , bullying producers to lower prices , and even banned the export of beef as a means to control inflation . 
( [PER See Septel  ] on evaluating [PER Kirchner  ] 's economic policy . 
) Crime continues to be a major public focus according to opinion surveys . 
[MISC Argentines  ] accustomed to minimal crime rates , particularly in the Greater [LOC Buenos Aires  ] area , have since the economic crisis faced a major problem with street crime , home invasions , kidnappings and other types of violent crime . 
The Capital has had several recent cases of shootings , robberies and rapes that have garnered a lot of media attention , giving the public the sensation of a surge in crime . 
Interior Minister [PER Anibal Fernandez  ] recently stated that [ORG GOA  ] statistics in fact show that crime is down , but this assertion is impossible to verify because the [ORG GOA  ] has not published national crime statistics since 2004. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) On the economic front , sustained growth requires increasing infusions of foreign investment , dealing with the energy shortage and controlling inflation . 
Private Direct Foreign Investment has increased significantly since the crisis , particularly in the tradable goods and services industries . 
Nevertheless , other sectors ( e.g. public services ) are badly in need of investment in order to sustain continued growth . 
A strategic flaw in the economic equation continues to be the energy sector . 
The [PER Kirchner  ] administration has faced serious pressure from utility companies and the [ORG G-7  ] to raise utility rates that have been pesified and then frozen for residential users since the peso devalued in 2002 . 
So far , the [ORG GOA  ] has been unwilling to raise utility rates for residential users , but [PER Kirchner  ] recently said he is open to discussions on the issue , although he made no promises . 
Without a utility rate [ORG BUENOS  ] AIR 00001594 003 OF 005 increase , it is doubtful that [LOC Argentina  ] will see major new foreign investments in public utilities in the short-term . 
[LOC Argentina  ] 's gas and electricity production has not kept up with the rapid growth of demand due to the absence of market incentives ( price ) to invest or expand production . 
( Comment: [PER Kirchner  ] 's unorthodox methods of controlling inflation , frozen utility rates and hardball tactics with the private sector may earn [PER Kirchner  ] short-term benefits , but they are not long-term solutions to [LOC Argentina  ] 's economic problems because they scare away foreign investment that [LOC Argentina  ] needs to sustain its economic growth .

) --------------------------------------------- ------- [PER KIRCHNER  ] WEAK ON SUPPORT FOR INSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Although [PER Kirchner  ] began his presidency by strengthening the independence of the [ORG Supreme Court  ] , his record since then on institutional-democracy building has been poor . 
Upon assuming office , [PER Kirchner  ] moved quickly to clean up former President [PER Carlos Menem  ] 's " automatic majority " [ORG Supreme Court  ] that was widely regarded as corrupt . 
[PER Kirchner  ] and his supporters in [ORG Congress  ] forced three [ORG Menem-era Supreme Court  ] justices to resign and impeached two others . 
[PER Kirchner  ] then appointed four well-respected jurists to succeed them . 
However , since that time [PER Kirchner  ] has failed to fill the remaining vacancies on the high court -- a second vacancy opened up after another justice retired -- reducing the effectiveness of the court . 
( Note: Rulings still require the support of five justices , which is more difficult to achieve with only seven instead of nine on the bench . 
End Note . 
) A proposal by legal experts to reduce the number of [ORG Supreme Court  ] justices from nine to five , as it was before [PER Menem  ] 's 1990 controversial judicial reform , has not been pursued by the [PER Kirchner  ] administration. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Over the past year , [PER Kirchner  ] has instigated a number of actions that have further debilitated [LOC Argentina  ] 's already weak democratic institutions . 
[PER Kirchner  ] has issued hundreds of presidential decrees during his presidency , preferring to avoid discussion or delay in [ORG Congress  ] , and signed more decrees in his third year of his presidency than laws approved by [ORG Congress  ] . 
A new law sponsored by his wife , [PER Cristina Fernandez  ] de [PER Kirchner  ] , nominally is designed to regulate the presidential-decree-making process . 
The bill , which will likely be signed into law shortly , would authorize presidential decrees that are not voted down by both houses of [ORG Congress  ] . 
The proposed bill does not set a time limit on when [ORG Congress  ] is required to vote after a presidential decree is issued and allows decrees to remain in force pending a congressional vote . 
( Note: Senator [PER Cristina Kirchner  ] proposed a bill in 2000 designed to regulate presidential decrees when [LOC Fernando de la Rua  ] of the [ORG Radical Civic Union  ] ( [ORG UCR  ] ) was President . 
Unlike her current bill , the 2000 [PER Cristina Kirchner  ] bill required [ORG Congress  ] to vote on presidential decrees within 20 days of their issuance and made the decrees invalid if just one house of [ORG Congress  ] voted against them . 
Senator [PER Kirchner  ] 's bill was not approved in 2000 , but [ORG UCR  ] Senator [PER Rodolfo Terragno  ] reintroduced [PER Kirchner  ] 's exact bill in the [ORG Senate  ] earlier this year , to which Senator [PER Kirchner  ] responded with the current modified version of the bill . 
End Note . 
) ( Comment: Congress' regulation of presidential decrees is a long-overdue action that was supposed to be addressed shortly following the 1994 constitutional reform . 
The current bill will serve to legitimate what has become an arbitrary use of presidential powers . 
[PER Kirchner  ] is not the first president to abuse the use of presidential decrees , but he has taken their use to new levels .

) <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Kirchner  ] and his supporters' manipulation of the electoral system before and after the October 2005 legislative elections gained them more power in [ORG Congress  ] , but sometimes ran counter to voters' wishes and the spirit of the Constitution and electoral law . 
In the October elections , the ruling [ORG PJ  ] party split in five of the eight provinces that were electing national senators , allowing them to gain all three [ORG Senate  ] seats in the five provinces . 
( Note: By dividing in several provinces , and in most cases reuniting after the [ORG BUENOS  ] AIR 00001594 004 OF 005 election , the [ORG PJ  ] circumvented a constitutional provision reserving a portion of the [ORG Senate  ] seats to miniority parties . 
Electoral law further stipulates that those parties that cannot agree on a unified electoral list hold primary elections to choose candidates , which the [ORG PJ  ] did not do in most provinces . 
See Reftel A. End Note . 
) [PER Kirchner  ] 's allies in [ORG Congress  ] also prevented right-wing Paufe leader [PER Luis Patti  ] from taking his seat in [ORG Congress  ] due to as yet unproven allegations of human rights abuses when [PER Patti  ] was a police commissioner during the last military dictatorship . 
[PER Patti  ] was prevented from taking his seat despite a ruling by the [ORG National Electoral Committee  ] prior to the election that there was nothing preventing [PER Patti  ] from assuming office and despite the nearly 400,000 people that voted for him in [LOC Buenos Aires  ] province ( See Reftel B ) . <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Kirchner  ] and his allies have used other questionable tactics that contradicted voters' intentions and have supporting provincial allies in overturning term limits . 
Cabinet Chief [PER Alberto Fernandez  ] drew newly-elected congressman for the opposition [ORG Republican Proposal  ] ( PRO ) [PER Eduardo Lorenzo Borocoto  ] over to [PER Kirchner  ] 's bloc by offering his son a lucrative government job . 
Several [PER Kirchner  ] congressmen elected in October never assumed their seats , such as [PER Jorge Taiana  ] , who became Foreign Minister , and [ORG La Rioja  ] Governor [PER Angel Maza  ] , who left his newly-won [ORG Senate  ] seat to his sister , [PER Ada Maza  ] . 
Tucuman Governor [PER Jose Alperovich  ] , with [PER Kirchner  ] 's blessing , recently changed his province 's constitution to allow himself to run for reelection . 
[PER Kirchner  ] is supporting similar efforts by friendly Governors in [LOC Jujuy  ] and [LOC Misiones  ] , and [LOC Buenos Aires  ] Governor [PER Felipe Sola  ] is in discussions with [PER Kirchner  ] to allow him to change the [LOC Buenos Aires  ] Constitution or ensure a favorable legal ruling so he also can run for reelection next year. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Kirchner  ] has achieved an unprecedented centralization of decision-making , but has weakened [LOC Argentina  ] 's system of checks and balances in the process . 
In February 2006 , [PER Kirchner  ] and his allies in [ORG Congress  ] succeeded in modifying the [ORG Council of Magistrates  ] that regulates the [MISC Argentine  ] judicial system , strengthening the [ORG Casa Rosada  ] 's control over the judiciary ( See Reftel C ) . 
[ORG Congress  ] is also likely to shortly approve granting Cabinet Chief [PER Alberto Fernandez  ] permanent " super " budgetary powers that will enable him to freely move funds from one area of the budget to another without approval from [ORG Congress  ] . 
The opposition in [ORG Congress  ] claim the proposed law will strip [ORG Congress  ] of its fundamental democratic role of controlling the budget and that these powers are no longer necessary because the economic crisis is over . 
The opposition further argues that the measure is simply designed to allow the [ORG GOA  ] to spend money however it wants during an election year , pointing out that [PER Alberto Fernandez  ] reassigned [ORG ARP  ] 500 million to social and public works projects just two weeks before the October 2005 legislative elections using these same powers . 
The Kirchners have lashed out repeatedly at the press and the opposition for their criticism of the [ORG Casa Rosada  ] 's recent actions in [ORG Congress  ] . 
The [ORG GOA  ] claims these are necessary powers to ensure the smooth functioning of the government . 
Regardless of the opposition 's objections , the [ORG Casa Rosada  ] appears to have the necessary votes to approve the measure by early August . 
( Note: These " super " budgetary powers were first granted by [ORG Congress  ] to the [ORG GOA  ] at the start of the economic crisis in 2001 and were re-approved every year through the 2005 budget . 
They were not included in the 2006 budget -- passed before the October elections gave [PER Kirchner  ] control of [ORG Congress  ] -- because of opposition resistance . 
The current bill would make these special budgetary powers permanent . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Kirchner  ] campaigned in 2003 on a strong anti-corruption message and his first Justice Minister , [PER Gustavo Beliz  ] , came with impeccable credentials and championed the cause of rooting out official corruption . 
Unfortunately , the [ORG GOA  ] has placed less emphasis on fighting corruption since then . 
In fact , since [PER Beliz  ] was fired in 2004 , [PER Kirchner  ] has avoiding speaking publicly about official corruption and the much-vaunted new Office of [MISC Anti-Corruption  ] has failed to live up to its envisioned potential . 
There [ORG BUENOS  ] AIR 00001594 005 OF 005 also have been credible allegations that Planning Minister [PER Julio De Vido  ] , a key [PER Kirchner  ] insider , has been involved in questionable federal and provincial public works contracts during [PER Kirchner  ] 's presidency ( See Reftel D ) . -------------------------------------------- [PER KIRCHNER  ] FOREIGN POLICY SUFFERS FROM NEGLECT -------------------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) President [PER Kirchner  ] 's lack of attention and understanding in the international relations arena has resulted in an erratic [ORG GOA  ] foreign policy . 
President [PER Kirchner  ] is not skilled at international diplomacy and relies on an ever-shrinking group of long-time advisors who lack foreign policy expertise to make key decisions . 
[PER Kirchner  ] has touted [ORG Mercosur  ] as a regional alternative to the [ORG FTAA  ] , but his conflict with [LOC Uruguay  ] over the construction of two paper plants has caused a crisis within the trading bloc . 
President [PER Kirchner  ] has recently sought closer relations with [LOC Spain  ] , even as he is putting more pressure on [MISC Spanish  ] companies with major investments in [LOC Argentina  ] , such as [ORG Repsol  ] and Aerolineas Argentinas . 
[PER Kirchner  ] has repeatedly thanked the [LOC U.S.  ] for its support to [LOC Argentina  ] during the crisis and sought to strengthen the bilateral relationship after short-circuits during the [MISC Summit of the Americas  ] , but took the opportunity during a recent press conference in [LOC Madrid  ] to criticize the [LOC U.S.  ] and claim that the [LOC U.S.  ] left [LOC Argentina  ] to face the crisis alone ( See Reftel E ) . <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The [PER Kirchner  ] administration 's most important foreign policy theme is the promotion of regional integration , which in practice has meant the strengthening of relations with [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[LOC Argentina  ] 's most important goal during its recent presidency of [ORG Mercosur  ] was the integration of [LOC Venezuela  ] into the trading bloc ( See Reftel F ) . 
[PER Kirchner  ] 's top officials have repeatedly told [MISC Embassy  ] officials that the [ORG GOA  ] 's relationship with [LOC Venezuela  ] is based on economics and [ORG Mercosur  ] . 
[PER Kirchner  ] sees [LOC Venezuela  ] as a solution for [LOC Argentina  ] 's energy and financing problems . 
[PER Kirchner  ] , who normally places a low priority on foreign relations , in the past 12 months has traveled twice to [LOC Caracas  ] and hosted [PER Chavez  ] three times in [LOC Argentina  ] . 
[PER Kirchner  ] will host [PER Chavez  ] again for the July 20-21 [LOC Mercosur Summit  ] in [LOC Cordoba  ] , [LOC Argentina  ] . 
[PER Kirchner  ] has also sought to strengthen relations with [LOC Brazil  ] , recently endorsing [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula  ] 's reelection and signing an accord on automobile sales between the two countries. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) To his credit , [PER Kirchner  ] has remained committed to [ORG OAS  ] efforts to return [LOC Haiti  ] to stability and constitutional democracy . 
Senior [ORG GOA  ] officials assure us that [MISC Argentine  ] peacekeepers will remain on the island for the long-term. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) President [PER Kirchner  ] has numerous successes to show after three years in office . 
The economy is booming and [MISC Argentines  ] feel a level of stability and dignity has been restored to their country which was lost in the political , economic and social disaster of 2001-2002 . 
In [PER Kirchner  ] 's first years in office , [LOC Argentina  ] needed a strong hand to lead it out of the depths of crisis . 
History has shown that long-term , broad-based economic growth needs to be accompanied by a strong institutional framework . 
Now that the crisis has past , the country needs a leader that is willing to spend some of his built-up capital to strengthen [LOC Argentina  ] 's weak democratic institutions . 
To date , it is unclear whether [PER Kirchner  ] has the will or capacity to make this transition .
