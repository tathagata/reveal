Kenny  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) During Special Envoy [PER Mitchell Reiss’  ] visit to [LOC Ireland  ] May 19-22 , the [MISC Irish  ] government emphasized that the Good Friday Agreement and the December 8 joint communique must be the basis for forward movement in the peace process . 
They anticipate an [MISC IRA  ] response to [PER Gerry Adams’  ] call to leave the scene within 60 days ; they believe the focus must be kept on the [MISC IRA  ] but do not have a specific list of steps the [MISC IRA  ] must take as pre-conditions to serious negotiations . 
They believe serious talks will begin in September , but it could take until early 2006 to put the pieces in place , especially since the [ORG DUP  ] would require a long period to verify [MISC IRA  ] good behavior . 
GOI officials uniformly expressed concern that the [MISC UK’s  ] political interest in showing progress might lead the [LOC UK  ] to be too soft on [ORG Sinn Fein  ] . 
Other issues raised include [MISC Irish  ] unhappiness with the [MISC UK’s  ] inquiry into the [PER Finucane  ] murder ; the importance of a non-violent marching season in [LOC Northern Ireland  ] ; and concerns about [MISC IRA  ] criminality . 
[PER Reiss  ] briefed on his meetings in [LOC London  ] and [LOC Belfast  ] and informed them of the USG’s decision to refuse a visa to [ORG Sinn Fein  ] member [PER Rita O’Hare.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [PER Mitchell Reiss  ] met with the [ORG Taoiseach  ] , PM [PER Bertie Ahern  ] ; Foreign Minister [PER Dermot Ahern  ] , Justice Minister [PER Michael McDowell  ] ; Finance Minister [PER Brian Cowen  ] ; and , [LOC UK  ] Ambassador [PER Eldon  ] . 
The Ambassador , DCM , POL/ECON Counselor , and [ORG S/P Special Assistant  ] accompanied him to all meetings . 
[PER Reiss  ] and the Ambassador also had a private lunch with President and Dr. [PER McAleese  ] . 
END SUMMARY ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) GOI concerns about [LOC UK  ] “softness” represent a role reversal . 
Usually , it is the [LOC UK  ] that is concerned [LOC Ireland  ] will be too accommodating to [ORG Sinn Fein  ] . 
The [MISC GOI’s  ] eventual position will depend on the [ORG Taoiseach  ] . 
He is generally considered “softer” on the provisional movement than either the Foreign Affairs or Justice Ministers . 
However , he believes [ORG Sinn Fein  ] leaders were aware of plans to rob the [ORG Northern Bank  ] even as they negotiated with him last Fall . 
Publicly , he has been unprecedentedly critical of [ORG Sinn Fein  ] and , until recently , greatly reduced private contacts as well . 
We are told that [PER Adams  ] prefers to deal directly with the [ORG Taoiseach  ] and not with cabinet ministers . 
In deciding how to move forward , the [ORG Taoiseach  ] is likely to look carefully at the IRA’s response to [PER Gerry Adams  ] , given strong public feelings against [MISC IRA  ] crime and paramilitarism . 
He is expected to call elections in 2007 or sooner . 
Having a deal in place would serve his political interests best ; however , more failed attempts to reach a deal would hurt him electorally , particularly if he were seen to have been played by [ORG Sinn Fein  ] . 
End Comment. -------------------------------------------- [ORG TAOISEACH  ] ADVISOR DESCRIBES GOI EXPECTATIONS -------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] opened the meeting with an update of [ORG GOI  ] actions . 
He said there had been very little [ORG GOI  ] engagement with [ORG Sinn Fein  ] since the talks broke down in December . 
He cited one meeting in January , one in March in [LOC Washington  ] , and several private meetings between the [ORG Taoiseach  ] and [PER Gerry Adams  ] . 
Significantly , he said the official feelings toward [ORG Sinn Fein  ] had changed with all that has happened since December ( [ORG Northern Bank  ] robbery , money laundering , [PER McCartney  ] killing . 
) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the [ORG GOI  ] is interested in the Good Friday Agreement and not in any “lesser models or deals.” Following [LOC UK  ] elections , the pace was picking up , he said , and he outlined a series of expected contacts with all parties . 
He said the [ORG GOI  ] was pleased at PM [MISC Blair’s  ] re-election , and that [ORG Sinn Fein  ] is aware that this is [MISC Blair’s  ] “last lap.” That , he said , plays both ways . 
[ORG Sinn Fein  ] knows that no successor is likely to be as engaged in the process as [PER Blair  ] , and that he represents their best hope of a deal . 
On the other hand , [ORG Sinn Fein  ] also believes they could take advantage of [MISC Blair’s  ] interest in getting a deal before leaving office . 
Special Envoy [PER Reiss  ] , referring to his talks in [LOC London  ] , said it is never good in a negotiation to appear more eager than the other side . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the [LOC UK  ] had offered [ORG Sinn Fein  ] a package following the December 8 breakdown , but withdrew it after the [ORG Northern Bank  ] robbery . 
( Note: [ORG Sinn Fein  ] has frequently expressed anger at the [LOC UK  ] for “going back on its word.” While never specifically mentioning a post-December 8 package , during the negotiations , [ORG Sinn Fein  ] seemed confident that the [LOC UK  ] felt [ORG Sinn Fein’s  ] decommissioning offer was worth taking up even if a comprehensive deal with the [ORG DUP  ] was not reached . 
) ...KEEP THE FOCUS ON THE [MISC IRA  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] indicated the focus must be kept on the [MISC IRA  ] . 
The [ORG GOI  ] , he said , hopes for decisive action , followed by a “proving period” and leading to talks that restore the executive . 
He anticipated that it might take until late fall or early in 2006 to put all the pieces together ; the [MISC IRA  ] would need to do something definitive within two months , and the [ORG DUP  ] would likely require a six-month testing period before agreeing to sit down with [ORG Sinn Fein  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said there is little appetite within the [ORG GOI  ] or the [MISC Irish  ] public for going “round and round again.” He said [ORG GOI  ] will not go about talks in a “headline way.” The credibility of the process and the players is in question , he said , and this time , talks must work . 
A deal is possible , he said , but will take time . 
[PER Reiss  ] responded by saying [PER Gerry Adams  ] had told him to expect an [MISC IRA  ] response in a month , before the marching season . 
[PER Reiss  ] said [PER Adams  ] had stated that “the [MISC IRA  ] must be taken out of the equation.” [PER Reiss  ] noted that public tolerance of accepting things at face value is gone . 
The [ORG IMC  ] must confirm that the [MISC IRA  ] takes any actions it promises . 
When the [ORG Taoiseach  ] joined the meeting , he said that verification would have to include witnesses of decommissiong ( probably clergy ) , in addition to the [ORG IICD  ] , as layed out December 8. ...QUIET MARCHING SEASON NECESSARY <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER Reiss  ] and the Ambassador agreed that tensions were high as marching season approaches , and it is vitally important that violence is averted . 
That message needs to be delivered to all parties . 
The Ambassador asked who is engaging with the [ORG Parades Commission  ] ; [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said there is a disconnect between the [ORG Parades Commission  ] and the [ORG PSNI  ] . 
All agreed that a violent marching season could set back prospects for political progress. ...DUP FLEXING ITS MUSCLES , INCLUDING REGARDING POLICING BOARD <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [PER Reiss  ] exchanged views on the [ORG DUP  ] , following their big win in [LOC UK  ] elections . 
The Ambassador noted that [ORG DUP  ] is looking to flex its muscles , and should not be allowed to unwind existing mechanisms , such as the [ORG Policing Board  ] , whose mandate expires October 18 . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] agreed and said the [ORG GOI  ] favors renewing the policing board in its current form. ------------------------------- [ORG TAOISEACH  ] DISCUSSES WAY FORWARD ------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The [ORG Taoiseach  ] joined the meeting , and layed out his vision of the way forward . 
Like [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] he felt any deal was many months away , with talks not starting until September and a deal not likely until January . 
The [ORG Taoiseach  ] then discussed what he felt was realistic to expect from the [MISC IRA  ] . 
He said that no one can expect the [MISC IRA  ] to agree to disband ; rather , it could enter a new commemorative role . 
His own father , he said , considered himself to be an [MISC IRA  ] man to the day he died in the 1990’s . 
[MISC IRA  ] members , he said , consider themselves to be soldiers and their [MISC IRA  ] membership is the center of their lives . 
They could , however , convert to a commemorative organization that visits graves and plans events to mark the anniversaries of atrocities . 
The [ORG Taoiseach  ] said he had explained this to [ORG DUP  ] leader [PER Ian Paisley  ] . 
By the same token , the [ORG Taoiseach  ] said [ORG Sinn Fein  ] knows that they have milked the process as much as they can . 
He said that “Gerry understands criminality must end” , even if he will not say that the [MISC IRA  ] has been involved in crime. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Reiss  ] described changes in perception within the [MISC Irish-American  ] community . 
Their conversations with the [ORG Taoiseach  ] , and the [MISC IRA’s  ] words and actions following the [PER McCartney  ] murder were giving them a more realistic view of the [MISC IRA  ] . 
The [ORG Taoiseach  ] agreed , but noted that it is still hard for much of [LOC Irish-America  ] to accept that the [MISC IRA  ] was involved in the murder . 
[PER Reiss  ] then informed the [ORG Taoiseach  ] that the [LOC US  ] had refused [ORG Sinn Fein  ] member [PER Rita O’Hare’s  ] visa request. ...TAOISEACH RAISES FINUCANE <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [ORG Taoiseach  ] raised the [PER Finucane  ] case , as did every other [ORG GOI  ] official with whom [PER Reiss  ] met . 
[PER Reiss  ] briefed him on his talks in [LOC London  ] , including with the head of [ORG MI5  ] , who committed to turning over all evidence her agency has to the inquiry , but she was adamant that the inquiry will proceed using the new legislation . 
[PER Reiss  ] noted his concern that the [PER Finucane  ] case will become an irritant in [MISC Irish  ] relations with the [LOC UK  ] and get in the way of a deal . 
The [ORG Taoiseach  ] said that the entire parliament was united in opposition to the [LOC UK  ] approach . 
Parliament does not believe the [LOC UK  ] will give all evidence because , in its view , the [LOC UK  ] did not cooperate fully with the [LOC Barron  ] commission’s investigation into the 1974 [LOC Dublin  ] and [LOC Monaghan  ] bombings . 
The [ORG Taoiseach  ] said that the [ORG GOI  ] wants the [LOC UK  ] to provide evidence acknowledging its involvement in Finucane’s murder and it wants to know how high in the [LOC UK  ] government collusion went . 
He said if the [LOC UK  ] were to provide the information , it would only grab the headlines for a few hours because “everyone knows the [LOC UK  ] was involved.” Other ministers made the same point and noted that the [ORG Taoiseach  ] is particularly seized with the [PER Finucane  ] case and would have to personally approve any compromise to ease the dispute with the [LOC UK  ] , such as [PER Reiss’  ] suggestion of putting an [MISC Irish  ] judge in charge of the inquiry. --------------------------------------------- --- FM ECHOES PM ON [MISC IRA  ] , [ORG GFA  ] , CONCERN ABOUT FINUCANE AND MARCHING SEASON --------------------------------------------- --- ....IRA <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) FM [PER Ahern  ] said he liked [PER Reiss’  ] public comments that the [MISC IRA  ] should respond “sooner rather than later , ” and he agreed with [PER Reiss  ] that the [MISC IRA  ] statement must be clean , with no ambiguity , and that the three governments need to agree on what they want from the [ORG IRA  ] . 
In the end , the [ORG DUP  ] must also be on board in order for a deal to be struck . 
FM [PER Ahern  ] was adamant that the [MISC Irish  ] government was interested in a comprehensive deal only , and was concerned that the [LOC UK  ] might be open to [LOC Sinn Fein’s  ] desire to cut a side deal with [LOC London  ] . 
He said that such talks between the [LOC UK  ] and [MISC IRA  ] were underway in December between the breakdown of talks and the [ORG Northern Bank  ] robbery . 
Such a deal , he said , would have allowed [ORG Sinn Fein  ] to barter decommissioning for concessions . 
Moreover , he said , a bilateral deal between the [LOC UK  ] and [ORG Sinn Fein  ] would polarize the situation in [LOC Northern Ireland.  ] ...Sinn [PER Fein  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) FM [PER Ahern  ] said that [ORG Sinn Fein  ] knows serious negotiations cannot begin unless trust is re-established . 
On the other hand , he said , maybe that’s not what they want . 
( Note: FM [PER Ahern  ] is here referencing the theory that [ORG Sinn Fein  ] finds engaging in the peace process in its interest because it softens the image of the party and gives them photo opportunities with prime ministers . 
According to this theory , the process is in [PER Sinn Fein’s  ] interest , but [ORG Sinn Fein  ] is not actually interested in striking a deal . 
) FM [PER Ahern  ] also touched on the balance the [ORG GOI  ] tries to strike in talking about and to [ORG Sinn Fein  ] . 
He said [ORG PSNI  ] and others told the [ORG GOI  ] that its tough line on [ORG Sinn Fein  ] since December had been helpful but no longer was , and they should “lighten up.” On the other hand , the [ORG GOI  ] also is asked why it talks to [ORG Sinn Fein  ] at all , given that the [ORG International Monitoring Commission  ] reports that they are continuining their activities . 
He noted that it is difficult for the two prime ministers to say “no” when [PER Gerry Adams  ] asks for a meeting . 
He said [ORG Sinn Fein  ] is insisting on working out details at the top level of government only . 
( COMMENT: This is tactically smart of [PER Gerry Adams  ] , especially if he , like others , sees the [ORG Taoiseach  ] as less tough on republicans than the outspoken Justice Minister or quieter but equally firm Foreign Minister . 
) ...Parade Season <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said intelligence sources were worried that malcontents were planning to disrupt the marching season . 
He noted that the [ORG DUP  ] and [ORG Orange Order  ] were “playing games” with the [ORG Parades Commission  ] , and repeated the view that [ORG PSNI  ] and the [ORG Parades Commission  ] were not connecting well . 
He said the [ORG GOI  ] is particularly worried about the “walk back” -- after the parades and drinking , when marchers and hangers on walk back through republican areas . 
Special [PER Envoy Reiss  ] said that a violent marching season would play into the hands of those who believe that only the [ORG IRA  ] can protect [MISC Catholic  ] communities. ...Finucane <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) FM [PER Ahern  ] raised the [PER Finucane  ] case , saying categorically that the [LOC UK  ] was not complying with its 2001 [PER Weston Park  ] commitments . 
He said the [ORG GOI  ] has lived up to its obligations and begun investigations into several cases . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that the [LOC UK  ] had pushed through its new [ORG Inquiries Act  ] and that the [PER Finucane  ] family would not cooperate on that basis. ...Policing Board <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Special [PER Envoy Reiss  ] noted that the [ORG Policing Board  ] was set to expire on October 18 , and asked for [MISC Irish  ] views , including on whether there were policy consequences of choosing to “continue” the board or to “reconstitute” it . 
FM [PER Ahern  ] said he had spoken to [LOC Northern Ireland  ] Secretary of State [PER Peter Hain  ] about the issue . 
He said the [ORG GOI  ] favors continuing the board , but the [ORG DUP  ] wants to reconstitute it . 
He asserted that the [ORG DUP  ] has no legal right to demand reconstitution on the basis of its electoral gains . 
FM [PER Ahern  ] also said he had raised [ORG IRA  ] crime with [PER Peter Hain  ] , especially in the context of cross border cooperation between the [MISC Irish  ] Criminal [ORG Assets Bureau  ] and the [LOC Northern Ireland  ] equivalent. ...International Fund for [LOC Ireland  ] ( [ORG IFI  ] ) <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) As he has done publicly , FM [PER Ahern  ] talked about the importance of continuing [ORG IFI  ] activities and the need to maintain donations from other governments . 
He said it is increasingly difficult to tap [ORG EU  ] peace and reconciliation funds . 
FM [PER Ahern  ] talked about the need to reorient the board toward reconciliation and policing , and noted the board was considering a five-year strategy , ending in closure . 
He asked for [LOC U.S.  ] views . 
The Ambassador noted that supporters of [LOC Ireland  ] in the [LOC U.S.  ] understand that the Ireland’s economic boom means that international contributions to [ORG IFI  ] will end at some point . 
One difficulty , he said , is that unionists only recently have taken part , and will insist on getting their fair share of grants . 
Special [PER Envoy Reiss  ] said that the IFI’s new ideas for policing are likely to be acceptable under [LOC U.S.  ] law. -------------------------------------------- Justice Minister [PER McDowell  ] focuses on the [ORG IRA  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Justice Minister [PER McDowell  ] , always the hardest hitting of the [MISC Irish  ] cabinet , opened the meeting by saying that the [MISC Good Friday Agreement  ] presumed the [ORG IRA  ] would go out of business and it is still in business seven years later . 
He said the provisional movement ( as he refers to jointly to the [ORG IRA  ] and [ORG Sinn Fein  ] ) regards its arms cache as an embarrassment . 
Its semtex and kalishnakovs do not serve any useful purpose , he said , and the provisionals do not want to leave weapons in the hands of dissidents . 
He said the provisionals consider their arms stash a political liability that undermines their claim to be pursuing their goals through peaceful means only. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) Minister [PER McDowell  ] believes the provisionals want to close down the hardware side of their operation but to stay in business to fund national and international programs . 
He also said that the provisionals give no indication of loosening their grip on national areas in [LOC Northern Ireland  ] where [ORG PSNI  ] does not go . 
For that reason , he noted , the provisionals want to hold on to personal weapons. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [PER McDowell  ] said some lessons have been learned about how to deal with the provisional movement . 
[PER McDowell  ] said that you only get concessions from the provisionals when you put your hand on their throat . 
When you play their propaganda game , they press for concessions . 
[PER McDowell  ] said he was “delighted” that [ORG Sinn Fein  ] was not invited to the [LOC White House  ] on March 17 . 
Looking forward , he said , the [ORG GOI  ] was not in appeasement mode , and should offer a cold shoulder to the provisionals . 
[ORG Sinn Fein  ] , he said , is “asking for warm words” but governments should not offer them . 
He credited [ORG Sinn Fein  ] with being “brilliant negotiators.” They create eagerness and a sense of partnership , as if to say , “let’s get together to sort out [ORG Sinn Fein  ] problems.” What they cannot stand , he said , is skepticism . 
[PER McDowell  ] said he has warned [PER Peter Hain  ] against side deals with the provisionals , especially now that there is no center ground in [LOC Northern Ireland.  ] ---------------------------- Finance Minister [PER Brian Cowen  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) In pursuing a political solution for [LOC Northern Ireland  ] , the [MISC British  ] and [MISC Irish  ] Governments needed to address the economic dimension to the peace process , Finance Minister [PER Brian Cowen  ] told Ambassador [PER Reiss  ] in a May 20 meeting . 
[PER Cowen  ] cautioned against an approach that focused on establishing institutions of self-government , while neglecting equally urgent economic imperatives , such as improving social services and tacking unemployment . 
He expressed concern that [ORG HMG  ] might wish to disengage from these challenges after a solution was reached . 
While the [MISC British  ] Exchequer had made statements on the limits of [LOC UK  ] financial support for the peace process , [PER Cowen  ] believed that [ORG HMG  ] and the [ORG GOI  ] could jointly foster a transition in [LOC Northern Ireland  ] toward an economic system less dominated by the public sector . 
This cooperation could take the form of coordinating Ireland’s [ORG National Spatial Strategy  ] with the [ORG North’s  ] development plans ; there was also the possibility of harmonizing tax rates and key commodity prices to spur cross-border investment . 
Ambassador [PER Reiss  ] agreed that it was important to avoid scenarios where economic difficulties would continue to fuel social tensions even after a political resolution was in hand. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 .
