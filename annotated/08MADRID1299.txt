( C ) Has the host country , in Post 's opinion , worked to promote the advancement of democracy and human rights in [LOC Cuba  ] ? 
[LOC Spain  ] played a leadership role in lifting [ORG EU  ] sanctions and in re-starting the [MISC EU-Cuba  ] dialogue on human rights , and subsequently claimed credit for what the [ORG GOS  ] assessed to be successful talks and improved conditions in [LOC Cuba  ] .

[MISC Spanish  ] opposition [ORG Partido Popular  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) accused Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] of playing the role of " [PER Castro  ] 's [PER Godfather  ] in [LOC Europe  ] " after [LOC Spain  ] led the [ORG EU  ] in lifting restrictive measures against [LOC Cuba  ] in June 2008 . 
During his [ORG Senate  ] appearance on June 25 , FM [PER Moratinos  ] defended the [ORG EU  ] 's action by praising economic and social reforms in [LOC Cuba  ] , as well as the opening of political debate on the [MISC Island  ] . 
Describing [PER Raul Castro  ] 's agricultural reform and looser restrictions on internet use as " fundamental and revolutionary , " [PER Moratinos  ] nonetheless reiterated the [ORG EU  ] 's demand that [LOC Cuba  ] release all political prisoners and reminded the [ORG Senate  ] that , while there were about 330 political prisoners in 2003 , the number had decreased to 243 in 2008 , a number he then said was " still too many .
