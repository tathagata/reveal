LeBaron for Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . ----------------- ( S/NF ) KEY POINTS ----------------- -- Post assesses that [LOC U.S.  ] investments in [LOC Qatar  ] 's energy industry , coupled with the onset of regular liquefied natural gas ( [ORG LNG  ] ) exports to the [LOC U.S.  ] 2009-12 , constitute the main critical infrastructure and key resources in [LOC Qatar  ] , which if destroyed , disrupted or exploited might have an immediate and deleterious effect on the [LOC United States  ] . 
-- [ORG Embassy Doha  ] continues to engage Government of [LOC Qatar  ] entities across the spectrum to increase awareness and implement increased security procedures to identify and protect critical infrastructure . 
These entities include [ORG Qatar Petroleum  ] and [ORG its Industrial Security Directorate  ] , the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] , and the [ORG Qatar Armed Forces  ] . 
-- Key [MISC Qatari  ] officials have recently made overtures of their willingness to embrace USG offers for assistance or requests for information/transparency on their current vulnerabilities and infrastructure protection programs . 
[ORG Embassy Doha  ] assesses that there is considerable scope for cooperation with the [ORG GOQ  ] on this issue , considerably more than at any time over the past three years . 
-- [ORG Embassy Doha  ] is currently preparing an interagency plan to engage [ORG GOQ  ] entities in a synchronized fashion on this issue . 
End Key [LOC Points.  ] ---------------------------- QATAR'S KEY ENERGY RESOURCES ---------------------------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [LOC Qatar  ] shares with [LOC Iran  ] the largest non-associated gas field in the world . 
[LOC Qatar  ] 's portion contains an estimated 900 trillion cubic feet of natural gas , giving it the third-largest reserves of natural gas in the world . 
[LOC Qatar  ] is believed to have an agreement with [LOC Iran  ] providing a set extraction limit in the field ; however , the details of this arrangement are not known to us . 
By 2009 , [LOC Qatar  ] 's share of hydrocarbon revenue from natural gas and derivatives was about equal to that derived from oil . 
At 30 metric tons per annum ( mta ) , [LOC Qatar  ] is already the world leader in [ORG LNG  ] exports . 
Current estimates are that by 2012 [LOC Qatar  ] will produce 77 million tons of [ORG LNG  ] annually , roughly a third of which [LOC Qatar  ] hopes to export to the [LOC U.S.  ] market . 
About half of the new global [ORG LNG  ] capacity coming online in the next four years will be in [LOC Qatar  ] . 
( [ORG Note: Per British Petroleum  ] calculations , 1 million metric tons of [ORG LNG  ] equals 48.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas . 
) ----------------------------------- QATAR'S [ORG CRITICAL INDUSTRIAL CENTERS  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) There are three main industrial facilities of interest that if destroyed , or if their production is disrupted , could have an immediate effect on [LOC U.S.  ] national economic security . 
In order of priority , these are [ORG Ras Laffan Industrial City  ] ( [ORG RLIC  ] ) , [ORG Mesaieed Industrial City  ] ( [ORG MIC  ] ) and port complex , and [ORG Dukhan Industrial City  ] . 
All three industrial centers are under the control and supervision of [ORG Qatar Petroleum  ] ( [ORG QP  ] ) , a semi-autonomous government organization whose Chairman , [PER Abdullah  ] bin [PER Hamad Al-Attiyah  ] , is also the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy and Industry . 
Natural gas production is primarily centered around the coast and offshore areas in the northeast of [LOC Qatar  ] , in and round [ORG Ras Laffan  ] ; while , oil production is concentrated on the western coast near [LOC Dukhan  ] as well as offshore platforms. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG Ras Laffan  ] is [LOC Qatar  ] 's flag-ship industrial center , predominantly focused on the production of [ORG Liquefied Natural Gas  ] ( [ORG LNG  ] ) and derivative petrochemicals obtained during the natural gas extraction process . 
Destruction or an attack disrupting production at [ORG RLIC  ] would cause exceptionally grave damage to the world market and [LOC U.S.  ] national economic security interests . 
As of 2008 , [LOC Qatar  ] [ORG LNG  ] production for export to [LOC Japan  ] and [MISC South Korean  ] represented over 60 percent of those respective countries internal natural gas consumption ; by 2012 a third of [MISC Qatari  ] [ORG LNG  ] produced could be destined for the [LOC U.S.  ] market , at which time it is estimated that [LOC Qatar  ] will be the largest source of imported [ORG LNG  ] to the [LOC U.S.  ] market . 
The current drop in global demand for gas will also result in more [ORG LNG  ] being sent to the [LOC U.S.  ] as the flexible market and storage capacity give the [LOC U.S.  ] the ability to soak up excess global supply in the short-term. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG QP  ] operating units [ORG QatarGas  ] and [ORG RasGas  ] are responsible for [ORG LNG  ] production in [ORG Ras Laffan  ] . 
[ORG QatarGas  ] production trains three and four will produce [ORG LNG  ] equivalent to 2.8 billion cubic feet of gas per day , and [ORG RasGas  ] is currently building two trains at [ORG Ras Laffan  ] with 7.8 million tons of annual capacity each . 
( " Trains " are the liquefaction plants which draw gas pumped at offshore platforms , liquefy it , and load it onto [ORG LNG  ] tankers . 
) These four trains will be among the largest in the world , and their production will be allocated in part to [LOC U.S.  ] markets . 
In addition , major [LOC U.S.  ] energy companies such as [ORG ExxonMobil  ] and [ORG ConocoPhillips  ] partner with [LOC Qatar  ] and currently have over $13 billion invested in [LOC Qatar  ] 's natural gas industry . 
Therefore , [ORG Ras Laffan  ] 's importance as a critical facility will continue to grow as production and exports to the [LOC U.S.  ] increase. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S/NF ) As of early 2009 , [ORG Qatar Petroleum Industrial Security Directorate  ] has continued security infrastructure improvements at [ORG RLIC  ] and the expansive [ORG Ras Laffan Industrial City Port  ] complex , after a series of security assessments conducted since 2005 by several western security firms . 
These improvements have included redesign and construction of a new main entry control point for [ORG RLIC  ] , plans for redesign of existing port boundaries under the [ORG International Maritime Organization  ] ( [ORG IMO  ] ) [ORG International Shipping  ] and [ORG Port Security  ] ( [ORG ISPS  ] ) code , construction of a new port entry control point equipped with radiological and nuclear material detection monitors and container screening portals , and incorporation of ground-based radar , overlapping [ORG CCTV  ] coverage and biometric enabled identification. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S/NF ) [ORG Mesaieed Industrial City  ] ( [ORG MIC  ] ) and port complex , located approximately 40 km south of [LOC Doha  ] , was officially established in 1996 and is the main shipping point for oil from [LOC Dukhan  ] to the international market . 
Destruction or disruption of port services would effectively shut down oil shipments from [LOC Qatar  ] , potentially affecting half of [LOC Qatar  ] 's petroleum revenue . 
In addition , the port complex is a key choke point for [LOC U.S.  ] and coalition military equipment , munitions and bulk aviation fuel delivery to [LOC Al-Udeid Air Base  ] and Camp As [LOC Sayliyah  ] , the two [MISC Qatari  ] military installations hosting [ORG U.S. Coalition  ] forces . 
Any disruption to port operations would severely limit [LOC U.S.  ] military operations throughout the [ORG U.S. Central Command AOR  ] . 
As an example , in September-October 2007 , strategic fuel reserves at [LOC Al  ] Udeid [LOC Airbase  ] were depleted because unscheduled , uncoordinated road construction caused increased transit time for fuel tankers . 
The situation continued for 30 days until resolved . 
Had the situation not been resolved , there would have been an impact on theater-wide combat and airlift operations. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) [LOC Mesaieed  ] is also the location of most of [LOC Qatar  ] 's light , medium and support petrochemical facilities ; producing fertilizer , fuel additives , lubricants , plastics and vinyl for domestic consumption and export . 
The facility comprises four major treatment plants as well as a specialized holding area to store and export products . 
[ORG Natural Gas Liquids Plants  ] 1 and 2 are designed to separate and fractionate [ORG LNG  ] extracted from various production areas into a number of fractionated final products . 
[ORG Natural Gas Liquids Plant  ] 3 is composed of separate units to treat gas and condensates , and plant 4 is an expansion and development of [ORG QP  ] , s gas treatment capacity alongside the fractionation and treatment facilities in [LOC Mesaieed  ] . 
All of these plants are directly adjacent to the port facilities , and a major incident at any of them could effectively shut down port operations. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S/NF ) The [ORG QP  ] subsidiary [ORG Qatar Aluminum Company  ] ( [ORG QATALUM  ] ) plant currently under construction at [LOC Mesaieed  ] is planned as the world , s largest aluminum production facility once completed and operational ( circa 2011 ) . 
In addition , subsidiary [ORG Qatar Chemical Company  ] ( [ORG QChem  ] ) plans to begin construction on the world , s largest chemical derivatives plant , and there are plans for a construction of a new [ORG Qatar Petroleum  ] oil refinery , the [PER Al Shaheen  ] refinery , to fully satisfy internal consumption needs and begin export of refined product at a greater price than traditional crude export . 
Construction on both of these projects at [LOC Mesaieed  ] was slated to begin in 2009 , but has since been delayed due to the current economic downturn and high costs of building materials. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [LOC Dukhan  ] industrial city currently accounts for the majority of [LOC Qatar  ] , s oil production . 
The destruction or disruption of production at [LOC Dukhan  ] would have a severe impact on the [MISC Qatari  ] economy and may affect global and [LOC U.S.  ] economies. -------------- USG ENGAGEMENT -------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C/NF ) Embassy [LOC Doha  ] and the [ORG State Department  ] have continued to identify [LOC Qatar  ] 's increasingly important role as a world producer in the oil and [ORG LNG  ] sectors and its inherent high value as a potential terrorism target as points of concern . 
[LOC Qatar  ] 's expectation of becoming the world 's [ORG LNG  ] and gas-to-liquids ( [ORG GTL  ] ) leader by 2012 necessitates a comprehensive energy infrastructure security program . 
[PER Post  ] assesses that [LOC Qatar  ] 's attention to energy infrastructure has improved since the previous CI/KR report , but is far from complete . 
While the [MISC Qataris  ] have adequately planned a production and shipping infrastructure for the booming business , it appears they are still in the beginning stages to consider how to protect it . 
However , recent overtures made by the Director of [ORG Qatar Petroleum  ] , s [ORG Industrial Security Directorate  ] , [ORG Ministry of Interior Brigadier Abdulaziz Al-Ansari  ] , to increased dialogue and cooperation have renewed [PER Post  ] , s efforts to engage [ORG GOQ  ] officials on critical energy infrastructure security. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Post  ] has a [MISC DCM-led  ] working group comprising [MISC Pol/Econ  ] , [ORG DAO  ] , [ORG GRPO  ] , [ORG OMC  ] , [ORG FCS  ] , and [ORG RSO  ] to lay the ground work for , and synchronize , engagement with the [ORG GOQ  ] on critical infrastructure protection . 
This group met most recently to discuss results of the mid-March 2009 [ORG U.S. Coast Guard International Shipping  ] and [ORG Port Security  ] ( [ORG ISPS  ] ) team visit to [LOC Ras Laffan  ] , [LOC Mesaieed  ] and [LOC Doha  ] ports . 
The team recommended a reciprocal [MISC Qatari  ] visit to a [LOC U.S.  ] port in June 2009 , as well as the possible establishment of a bilateral security agreement with [LOC Qatar  ] specifically addressing dedicated [ORG LNG  ] shipments between the two countries . 
[PER Post  ] also wishes to restart the engagement process with the [MISC Qataris  ] on the [ORG DOS/DOE Critical Energy Infrastructure  ] program ( [ORG CEIP  ] ) based on recent , positive signals from the host government. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) In addition , [PER Post  ] through the [ORG Department of Energy  ] , s [ORG National Nuclear Security Administration  ] ( [ORG NNSA  ] ) , Second Line of [ORG Defense Office  ] , has been working with the [ORG Qatari Ministry of Environment  ] , s [ORG Department of Nuclear Energy  ] and [ORG Radiological Protection  ] to provide training and equipment selection for [LOC Qatar  ] 's nascent radiological detection and response program since April 2008 . 
In July 2008 , [LOC Qatar  ] sent 10 mid- to senior level personnel from the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] , [ORG Qatar State Security , Internal Security Force and Qatar Petroleum Security  ] to a workshop on nuclear detection and monitoring at the [LOC HAMMER  ] facility at the [ORG Pacific Northwest National Lab  ] ( [ORG PNNL  ] ) in [LOC Washington  ] state . 
[LOC Qatar  ] intends to place vehicle and pedestrian radiological and nuclear material detection monitors at ports in [PER Ras Laffan  ] , [LOC Mesaieed  ] and [LOC Doha  ] , as well as [ORG Doha International Airport  ] and the land border crossing with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] at [LOC Abu Samra.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( S/NF ) [PER Post  ] is formatting a detailed multifaceted response on a way forward in our efforts to engage [LOC Qatar  ] that would leverage the various agencies of the country team ( septel ) . 
This response will address a three-prong approach to various [MISC Qatari  ] governmental and energy-related organizations featuring political/economic engagement , military to military training and assistance with the [ORG Qatari Armed Forces and Ministry of Interior  ] , and the leveraging of commercial contacts with [ORG Qatar Petroleum  ] and the [ORG Ministry of Energy  ] . 
[PER Post  ] will be preparing a plan bringing together each of the various threads of this engagement. ------------------------- U.S./QATARI JOINT EFFORTS ------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C/NF ) As a result of an [MISC S/CT  ] and DS/ATA June 2007 visit , [PER Post  ] drafted a joint working group framework to continue dialogue on energy infrastructure security . 
To date , the [ORG GOQ  ] has been slow in embracing the framework agreement ; however , [PER Post  ] , [ORG Department and USG  ] concerns have not fallen on deaf ears . 
[ORG GOQ  ] officials have expressed their own concerns , identifying a risk associated with critical infrastructure , during meetings with [PER Post  ] officials and [ORG USG  ] visitors since early 2007 . 
In January 2009 meetings with [ORG Qatar Petroleum Security  ] , s [ORG Brigadier Al-Ansari  ] and [PER Poloff Zebley  ] , [ORG Al-Ansari  ] indicated he had received a read-out of the November 2007 USG-GOQ sponsored [ORG Gulf Security Dialogue  ] from the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] and wanted to discuss further cooperation with the [ORG USG  ] . 
[ORG Al-Ansari  ] , who concurrently serves as the number three uniformed member of the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] as [ORG MOI  ] Director of Logistics , appears to be the key decision maker on all critical industrial infrastructure issues at our identified key facilities ) [ORG Ras Laffan Industrial City  ] and [ORG Mesaieed Industrial City.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) The [MISC Qatari  ] government 's appreciation of [LOC U.S.  ] training and technology presents numerous prospects for [LOC U.S.  ] engagement . 
We know that [LOC Qatar  ] will need trainers , assistance on selection of physical security equipment ( such as delta pop-up barriers , fences and anti-vehicle berms ) , nonlethal weapons and tactics , and other technological equipment ( [LOC CCTV  ] , etc ) . 
Offshore protection is an area with the greatest potential ; [LOC Qatar  ] will need additional and more advanced offshore patrol vessels , plus enhanced maritime surveillance and communications equipment , weapons and trained crews . 
There is currently a lack of standardized security practices ; however , the [MISC Qatari  ] government has identified gaps in security infrastructure and has worked with [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC European  ] commercial firms to begin acquisition and training in the use of technical security equipment. ---------------------- [ORG GOQ  ] INTEREST AND PLANS ---------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( S/NF ) In 2005 , the [ORG GOQ  ] contracted with a [LOC U.S.  ] security and safety company to perform a top-down , zero-based review of critical infrastructure protection ; the study encompassed organizational lines of command and control for the security services and industrial facility security at the three facilities identified previously . 
The resultant report finished by the [LOC U.S.  ] company in 2007 , which has not been shared with the [ORG USG  ] and remains highly classified by the [ORG GOQ  ] , reportedly identified and prioritized deficient areas and provided recommendations in each . 
Subsequent to the report , [ORG Qatar Petroleum Security Directorate  ] placed a tender for a detailed security infrastructure assessment in March 2009 . 
The assessment will identify needed technical and security equipment and related facilities ( security control buildings , barricades , etc ) . ------------------------------------- [ORG Qatari Strategic Security Initiatives  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( S ) As detailed in the Ref C January 2008 meeting between [ORG Department of Energy Assistant  ] Secretary [PER Kevin Kolevar  ] and [ORG Minister of State for Energy and Industry  ] [PER Mohammed Saleh Al-Sada  ] , the [ORG Heir Apparent  ] had established an [ORG Industrial Security Steering Committee  ] , under the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] and headed by [ORG Brigadier Al-Ansari  ] , charged with managing the current nationwide industrial security apparatus and improving overall security capacity . 
The creation of the steering committee was part of the [ORG Heir Apparent  ] 's strategic security initiatives , which include the planned establishment of an integrated [ORG National Command Center  ] ( [ORG NCC  ] ) and development of the [ORG National Security Shield  ] ( [ORG NSS  ] ) . 
The [ORG NCC  ] would provide coordinated command and control of security and civil defense units in response to national emergencies , while the [ORG NSS  ] would create a series of interconnected fixed and mobile radar platforms to identify threats by sea , air and land. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( S/NF ) As of mid-March 2009 , the [ORG NCC  ] was under the operational control of the [ORG MOI  ] and co-located at [LOC Camp Duheil  ] with the [ORG MOI  ] , s [ORG Police Training Center  ] . 
The center was staffed 24/7 by various [MISC Qatari  ] civil defense , heath and security organizations and maintained direct contact with [ORG Qatar Petroleum Security  ] officials. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( S/NF ) In February 2009 , the [ORG NSS  ] placed a tender for the construction of the first-phase of the [ORG NSS  ] , which consisted of the construction of 18 80-meter metal lattice towers for placement of integrated [ORG European Aeronautics  ] , Defense , and [ORG Space Corporation  ] ( [ORG EADS  ] ) radars for interlocking coverage along the land border with [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and coasts . 
However , [PER Post  ] has been unable to ascertain specifics on the radar system and/or the ultimate [MISC Qatari  ] organization responsible for management of the program , even though , select coverage provided by the [ORG NSS  ] would be shared with [ORG Qatar Petroleum Security  ] and integrated within the [LOC NCC.  ] <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( S/NF ) The [ORG Qatar Armed Forces  ] have for several years been considering adopting an integrated air defense system that could include the [MISC Patriot PAC-3  ] missile system . 
The [ORG Qatar Armed Forces  ] have made clear that a major purpose of an air defense system would be the protection of their critical energy infrastructure . 
To that end , the [MISC Qataris  ] have asked us to explore ways in which the coverage area for [LOC U.S.  ] military-controlled [ORG Patriots  ] currently in [LOC Qatar  ] could be expanded to include the [ORG LNG  ] facilities at [ORG Ras Laffan  ] . 
[LOC Qatar  ] 's interest in an air defense system presents another opportunity for [MISC U.S.-Qatar  ] engagement on critical infrastructure protection .
