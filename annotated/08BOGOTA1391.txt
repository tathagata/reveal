Brownfield  ] . 
Reasons: 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) [ORG Colombian Armed Forces Commander  ] [PER Padilla  ] stressed to the Ambassador on April 4 that the [ORG GOC  ] would do all it could to support the [MISC French  ] humanitarian operation seeking [PER Ingrid Betancourt  ] 's release , though he doubted its prospects for success . 
[PER Padilla  ] said [ORG GOC  ] continued its efforts to locate all of the hostages , including the three [MISC Americans  ] . 
He also asked for continued [ORG USG  ] assistance and intelligence sharing on [LOC U.S.  ] hostages , [LOC Venezuela  ] , and [LOC Ecuador  ] . 
[PER Padilla  ] reiterated President [PER Uribe  ] 's request for an agreement on a [ORG Cooperative Security Location  ] ( CSL ) in [LOC Palanquero  ] this year . 
The [ORG Armed Forces Commander  ] said he remains committed to removing military personnel believed to be involved in criminal activity or human rights violations . 
END SUMMARY , ----------------------------- [MISC FRENCH  ] HUMANITARIAN OPERATION ----------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) General [PER Padilla  ] told the Ambassador on April 4 that earlier that day he had met with the [MISC French  ] , [MISC Spanish  ] and [MISC Swiss  ] ambassadors to discuss the [MISC French  ] humanitarian initiative on [PER Ingrid Betancourt  ] . 
( Note: The [MISC French  ] Government dispatched an air ambulance to [LOC Colombia  ] earlier that week to provide emergency medical attention to [PER Betancourt  ] . 
It remained parked at [LOC Bogota  ] 's air base since arrival . 
) [PER Padilla  ] saw almost no chance that the [MISC French  ] would gain access to [PER Betancourt  ] , but said that the [ORG GOC  ] was doing everything it could to assist the [ORG GOF  ] to ensure it could not be blamed for the operation 's failure . 
The [ORG GOC  ] agreed to let the [ORG GOF  ] base planes in [LOC Colombia  ] , fly wherever they wanted , suspend military operations in areas to which the [ORG GOF  ] wanted to travel , and to assist in any other way necessary to facilitate a [PER Betancourt  ] release by the [ORG Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia  ] ( [ORG FARC  ] ) . 
He said the [ORG GOC  ] would oppose the use of [MISC Venezuelan  ] helicopters or involvement of [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] in the operation , and would offer the [MISC French  ] the use of [ORG GOC  ] helicopters if needed . 
[PER Padilla  ] said " the best thing about this operation to date is that the [ORG FARC  ] is the one being blamed for intransigence . 
" ----------------------- [LOC U.S.  ] HOSTAGE OPERATIONS ----------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [PER Padilla  ] underscored to the Ambassador that the [ORG GOC  ] continues to work toward the freedom of all of the [ORG FARC  ] held hostages . 
The [MISC Colombian  ] military is still working to locate the [LOC U.S.  ] hostages with special operations forces deployed in the south . 
If located the [MISC COLMIL  ] stands ready to assist in negotiating the release or cooperating on the rescue of the three [LOC U.S.  ] hostages held by the [ORG FARC  ] in close coordination with the [ORG USG  ] . 
The Ambassador assured [PER Padilla  ] that the [ORG USG  ] will give the highest priority possible to providing intelligence assets for ongoing efforts to locate the hostages . 
[PER Padilla  ] agreed a [MISC USG-GOC  ] " lessons learned " exercise on hostage issues would be useful and could be done at the end of April at the SOUTHCOM-Defense Minister level. -------------------------------- ESTABLISHING A CSL IN [LOC PALANQUERO  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Padilla  ] reminded the Ambassador that on April 1 President [PER Uribe  ] had stressed his desire to conclude an agreement for a CSL at [LOC Palanquero  ] in 2008 . 
[PER Padilla  ] said the [ORG GOC  ] understood that announcing a CSL at [LOC Palanquero  ] would provoke a reaction from the [MISC Venezuelans  ] and [MISC Ecuadorians  ] . 
The [ORG GOC  ] would never say so publicly , but that was what the [ORG GOC  ] was looking for . 
[PER Padilla  ] said [PER Uribe  ] 's support meant the [ORG GOC  ] would rapidly respond to a [ORG USG  ] request on [LOC Palanquero  ] . 
The [ORG GOC  ] did not expect [LOC Palanquero  ] to be operational in 2008 , but wanted an agreement concluded . 
[PER Padilla  ] told the Ambassador he would call the Chairman of the [ORG Joint Chiefs of Staff  ] as well as the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG SOUTHCOM Commander  ] on the issue. --------------------- [LOC VENEZUELA  ] AND [LOC ECUADOR  ] --------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Padilla  ] said that from a military perspective , he was satisfied with the way the recent border dust up with [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC Ecuador  ] played out . 
The [MISC Colombian  ] military saw that the [ORG Venezuelan Armed Forces  ] were considerably weaker than they had believed . 
In contrast , the [MISC Ecuadorian  ] military showed it was a much more professional , if smaller , force than its [MISC Venezuelan  ] counterparts . 
[PER Padilla  ] acknowledged that the [MISC Colombian  ] military needed to reestablish its bilateral relations with the [MISC Ecuadorians  ] , but said this would take time . 
He again asked for continued intelligence exchange on [LOC Venezuela  ] , and also sought any additional intelligence the [ORG USG  ] could provide on [LOC Ecuador  ] . 
The Ambassador committed to looking into the matter , but reminded [PER Padilla  ] both countries benefited by keeping the intelligence relationship quiet . 
[PER Padilla  ] agreed. --------------------------------------------- ------- [ORG HUMAN RIGHTS AND CORRUPTION PROBLEMS  ] IN THE MILITARY --------------------------------------------- ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Padilla  ] said he remains committed to removing military personnel believed to be involved in improper criminal activity or human rights violations , even if there is insufficient evidence to bring legal action against them . 
He asked if the [ORG USG  ] could help the [ORG GOC  ] identify such individuals . 
The Ambassador said we shared [PER Padilla  ] 's concern , but did not want to substitute ourselves for the [MISC Colombian  ] legal process or to undercut [MISC Colombian  ] institutions' capacity-- and responsibility--to police themselves . 
He promised to get back to [PER Padilla  ] on the human rights issue .
