REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: Convicted [MISC Pan Am 103  ] bomber [PER Abdel Basset  ] al-Megrahi returned home to a warm welcome at [LOC Tripoli  ] 's [ORG Mitiga Air Base  ] August 20 at around 2045hrs . 
Accompanied by [PER Qadhafi  ] 's son and potential successor , [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , [PER Megrahi  ] appeared frail as he emerged from a private plane owned by quasi-independent [ORG Air Afriqiyah  ] . 
[MISC Libyan  ] Government representatives were notably absent from the homecoming and reportedly hastily removed a much larger throng of supporters following [ORG POTUS'  ] statement critical of [PER Megrahi  ] 's return . 
Although [MISC Libyan  ] local press coverage of [PER Megrahi  ] 's return was low-key , a concurrent huge youth rally in downtown [LOC Tripoli  ] -- technically unrelated to [PER Megrahi  ] 's return -- created the perception of a hero 's welcome and certainly played to [PER Qadhafi  ] 's own domestic equities . 
[PER Megrahi  ] appears to have gone directly from [ORG Metiga Air Base  ] to his home , where he may have met [PER Muammar Qadhafi  ] . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] Government has not publicly responded to [ORG POTUS'  ] call for [PER Megrahi  ] to remain under house arrest . 
There was no indication of anti-American or anti-Western sentiment in the day 's events . 
End Summary . 
2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi emerged from a private plane owned by [LOC Libya  ] 's quasi-independent [ORG Afriqiyah Airlines  ] at [LOC Mitiga Air Base  ] ( former [LOC U.S.  ] Wheelus [ORG Air Base  ] ) , at 2045 local time on August 20 , wearing a fez and a white traditional [MISC Libyan  ] outfit . 
As he exited the plane , he supported [PER Abdel Basset  ] al-Megrahi , raising his hand and acknowledging [PER Megrahi  ] 's family and a large crowd awaiting his arrival . 
The crowd of about 100 people , mostly men , hailed [PER Megrahi  ] 's return and carried [MISC Libyan  ] and [MISC Scottish  ] flags and the ubiquitous press photo of a young [PER Megrahi  ] . 
Notably , [PER Megrahi  ] was not greeted by [MISC Libyan  ] Government officials . 
In [PER Saif  ] 's remarks to the press upon arrival , he noted " our efforts have succeeded , " citing evidence of [PER Megrahi  ] 's innocence , and thanking the [ORG Scottish Government  ] for its courageous decision . 
The arrival coincided with a text message to all [ORG Libyana  ] mobile phone network ( one of two major carriers in [LOC Libya  ] ) subscribers announcing the " release of the national hero [PER Megrahi  ] , " lauding him as the man who sacrificed himself so that [LOC Libya  ] could have sanctions lifted . 
[PER Saif  ] 's television station " [PER Al Mutawassit  ] " was the only [MISC Libyan  ] channel given rights to broadcast [PER Megrahi  ] 's return . 
[ Note: Embassy sources report that local satellite networks did not carry the station , and only those with international satellite receivers were able to access the broadcast . 
End note . 
] 3 . 
( C ) An [ORG AP  ] reporter who had been bussed into [ORG Metiga Air Base  ] -- along with other international correspondents -- to cover [PER Megrahi  ] 's return told us today that the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Government  ] appeared to have dramatically shifted gears for its planned welcome for [PER Megrahi  ] following [ORG POTUS'  ] statement on [PER Megrahi  ] 's return . 
The international press corps was held on a bus for more than three hours and not allowed access to the tarmac to cover the return . 
The [ORG AP  ] reporter said that he observed the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Government  ] hastily removing " thousands " of people who had gathered to welcome [PER Megrahi  ] while the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Government  ] kept the plane closed and waiting on the tarmac for a more subdued welcome scene . 
The [ORG GOL  ] reportedly limited the crowd to approximately 100-200 youth movement members ( those seen on TV wearing matching shirts and hats ) . 
The [ORG AP  ] reporter believes that the youth movement representatives were allowed to remain on the scene as a nod to [PER Saif  ] al-Islam 's involvement in the return . 
4 . 
( C ) At the same time [PER Megrahi  ] was landing at [LOC Metiga  ] , a crowd of thousands of [MISC Libyan  ] youth gathered on [LOC Green Square  ] in the center of downtown [LOC Tripoli  ] for the occasion of the " [MISC Fourth Annual Youth Movement  ] , " sponsored by the [ORG Qadhafi International Charity and Development Foundation  ] ( [ORG QDF  ] ) , chaired by [PER Saif  ] al-Islam [PER Qadhafi  ] . 
Embassy contacts who attended the rally reported a heavy security presence and said that participants were expecting [PER Saif  ] to deliver remarks , as he does annually , at the event . 
Neither participants nor event organizers made linkages between the [PER Megrahi  ] release and the rally . 
Embassy contacts report that some participants did not realize that [PER Megrahi  ] had been released from prison . 
Attendees were not allowed to carry cell phones into the rally grounds and would not have received the " [ORG Libyana  ] " message of [PER Megrahi  ] 's release until after the event . 
The event , for which crowds of youth began to gather at around 1900hrs , ended in an anti-climatic fashion at around 2300hrs , without the anticipated speech by [PER Saif  ] al-Islam . 
Independent website " [LOC Libya  ] al-Youm " described [PER Saif  ] 's absence as " strange , " although [ORG QDF  ] Director [PER Sawani  ] had told us August 16 that [PER Saif  ] al-Islam did not plan to attend the rally ( reftel ) . 
In an August 21 telephone conversation with the Charge , [ORG QDF  ] Executive Director [PER Yusuf Sawani  ] declined to comment [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000685 002.2 OF 002 on [PER Saif  ] 's return to [LOC Libya  ] with [PER Megrahi  ] or on the August 20 rally , telling us tersely and repeatedly that " everything that happened was televised . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>Â¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Although rumors are swirling that [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] met [PER Megrahi  ] at some point after his return , we are not able to confirm these reports . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] press reported that [PER Qadhafi  ] had been looking at economic projects in [LOC Sebha  ] -- [PER Megrahi  ] 's hometown -- on August 19 , and [MISC Libyan  ] Government officials told the [LOC UK  ] Ambassador ( who had been seeking a meeting with [PER Qadhafi  ] to deliver a message from PM Brown on this issue ) that [PER Qadhafi  ] had not returned to [LOC Tripoli  ] by 1830 local time on August 20 . 
We assume that [PER Qadhafi  ] stayed in [LOC Sebha  ] to greet [PER Megrahi  ] in his hometown but do not yet have any information to verify this assumption . 
Local press has not yet mentioned any interaction between [PER Muammar Qadhafi  ] and [PER Megrahi  ] . 
6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Local press did not report on the [LOC U.S.  ] position to [PER Megrahi  ] 's release or on President [PER Obama  ] 's calls for [PER Megrahi  ] to remain under house arrest . 
Rather , state-owned television station " [PER Al Jamahiriya  ] " and [MISC Libyan  ] news agency " [ORG JANA  ] " reported that [LOC Libya  ] was " crowned " by [PER Megrahi  ] 's release and return home from [LOC Scotland  ] . 
" [ORG JANA  ] " noted that " the position of the [PER Jamahiriya  ] that al-Megrahi should be released since he was a political hostage has attracted widespread international support , " citing statements made in the past by the [ORG Arab League  ] , [ORG African Union  ] , and the [MISC Non-Aligned Movement  ] . 
Notably , [MISC Libyan  ] state-owned television did not carry live coverage of [PER Megrahi  ] 's return and covered the return only during late-night news broadcasts , well after the actual event . 
7 . 
( C ) Comment: The [MISC Libyan  ] Government appears to be trying to manage the optics of [PER Megrahi  ] 's return for two different audiences: the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Libya  ] 's own domestic constituencies . 
By keeping [MISC Libyan  ] Government officials away from [PER Megrahi  ] 's return at [ORG Metiga Air Base  ] , hastily removing the assembled throngs , and limiting live domestic coverage of the event , the [ORG GOL  ] may believe and argue that it technically has stuck to its pledge that the welcome would be " low-key . 
" Yet [PER Saif  ] al-Islam 's role in [PER Megrahi  ] 's return , coupled with the huge --albeit technically unrelated -- rally in downtown [LOC Tripoli  ] , sends an undeniable message of [PER Qadhafi  ] family ( and hence [MISC Libyan  ] Government ) involvement in and feting of [PER Megrahi  ] 's return . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] may well have felt that this second message was important for his own domestic political considerations . 
8 . 
( C ) Comment continued: As far as the Embassy is aware , [PER Megrahi  ] was transported directly to his home after his arrival . 
The government has not publicly responded to [ORG POTUS'  ] call to maintain [PER Megrahi  ] under house arrest . 
As August 21 marks the first day of [PER Ramadan  ] , we suspect government officials will keep a low-profile during the day , although evening television programming -- widely watched during [PER Ramadan  ] -- may reveal more information about the [MISC Libyan  ] Government 's posture . 
We will continue to monitor and report on the situation . 
End Comment .
