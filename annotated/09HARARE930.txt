<code><pre>Wednesday , 02 December 2009 , 14:01 C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 [LOC HARARE  ] 000930 SIPDIS AF/S FOR [MISC BRIAN WALCH  ] NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR MICHELLE GAVIN EO 12958 DECL: 12/02/2019 TAGS PREL , PGOV , ZI SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR RAY’S VISIT WITH [MISC GERMAN  ] AMBASSADOR TO ZIM Classified By: AMBASSADOR CHARLES A. RAY FOR REASONS 1.4 B , D <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: There is a strong need in [LOC Zimbabwe  ] for security sector reform , as without it , none of the efforts at political reform can be assured . 
After [PER Robert Mugabe  ] leaves the scene ( either through death or retirement ) [MISC ZANU-PF  ] as a political force in [LOC Zimbabwe  ] will be irrelevant , although some of the party members are likely to continue to be involved in the country’s politics . 
We need to start now to identify the next generation of the country’s leadership and begin the process of influencing them . 
According to an [ORG MDC  ] member of [LOC Parliament  ] , there are three [MISC ZANU-PF  ] factions in government and [LOC Parliament  ] ; a few mostly younger people who want to work with [ORG MDC  ] and move the country forward , a large percentage ( including [PER Mugabe  ] ) who want to hang on to power for as long as they can , and a small number of extreme hardliners ( [PER Emmerson Mnangagwa  ] among them ) who for ideological or personal reasons want the coalition government to fail regardless of the consequences to the nation . 
[LOC South Africa  ] , at the end of the day , is not likely to be as helpful as we would like in improving the situation here , and we need to look at how to involve the [LOC PRC  ] as the [MISC Chinese  ] have Mugabe’s ear . 
[LOC China  ] is likely to be agreeable to efforts to improve economic stability and just might be helpful in achieving success in security sector reform . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) I met Dr. [PER Albrecht Conze  ] , [MISC German  ] Ambassador to [LOC Zimbabwe  ] , at his embassy on December 1 , 2009 . 
Unlike most of the other [ORG EU  ] ambassadors who waited for me to ask them questions , [PER Conze  ] immediately began probing for the [LOC U.S.  ] position on a number of issues , most notably how to engage with the government in the medium term , and our views on security sector reform . 
He stressed that the need for success in dealing with the security chiefs cannot be underestimated . 
Without reform in this sector , our efforts at political and economic reform risk failure . 
[PER Conze  ] agreed with me that we need to do more to identify the next generation of leadership in [LOC Zimbabwe  ] and start influencing them now . 
He is concerned about the obsessive focus on [PER Mugabe  ] , who is admittedly part of the problem , but is also essential to its solution . 
Should he suddenly die , or otherwise be moved from office , it could lead to chaos and violence as competing groups vied for control . 
[PER Conze  ] believes that [MISC ZANU-PF  ] in a post-Mugabe world will be irrelevant and will not exist in its current form , although some [MISC ZANU-PF  ] members are likely to continue to be involved in [LOC Zimbabwe’s  ] politics. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Conze  ] said that in conversations with [MISC MDC-M  ] politician [PER David Coltart  ] , he was told that in [LOC Parliament  ] and government there are three [MISC ZANU-PF  ] factions . 
A small number of mostly younger [MISC ZANU-PF  ] members want to cooperate with the [ORG MDC  ] to move the country out of the rut it is in . 
The vast majority ( including [PER Mugabe  ] himself ) are in a second group that is willing to make only grudging concessions but is primarily interested in hanging on to their positions as long as they can . 
A smaller , third faction ( which includes Defense Minister [PER Mnangagwa  ] ) of extreme hardliners work hard to cause the coalition government to fail without any regard to the impact this would have on the country . 
Some of them are motivated by revolutionary ( [MISC Marxist  ] ) fervor , some by personal grudges and animosities , and some are , in Conze’s words , just evil and greedy . 
Despite his advanced age , [PER Mugabe  ] is the spider sitting at the center of this web and has full control over all the factions . 
Without him , many of them would be nothing and would have nothing . 
Even most in the [ORG MDC  ] recognize that he is key to the future of politics here. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [LOC Peoples’ Republic of China  ] ( [LOC PRC  ] ) plays a significant role in [LOC Zimbabwe  ] and the [MISC Western  ] nations need to involve them more in cooperative activities wherever possible . 
[PER Conze  ] agreed with me that while they are not likely to want to participate in pro-democracy programs , economic stability is clearly in their interests . 
He considered an invitation to the [LOC PRC  ] ambassador here to periodically attend the [PER Fishmongers Head  ] of [LOC Mission  ] meeting ( a group of [MISC US-Canada-Australia-EU  ] ambassadors who meet weekly ) to explore potential areas of cooperation . 
[PER Conze  ] believes that the [LOC PRC  ] might even be useful in moving security sector reform forward as it has a potential impact on economic stability , and he does not believe [LOC South Africa  ] will be really useful in this regard. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) COMMENT: While [PER Conze  ] , like many of the [MISC European  ] ambassadors here , often puts too much faith in utterances by [LOC HARARE  ] 00000930 002 OF 002 [ORG MDC  ] officials , the characterization of the [MISC ZANU-PF  ] factions seems right on the money . 
It also indicates that change here will come slowly , and that [PER Mugabe  ] , who has without a doubt been a large part of the problem , is essential to maintaining control long enough to allow reform to take hold . 
He will continue to make meaningless concessions here and there , but is not likely to cede any power or control for the foreseeable future . 
[ORG MDC  ] for its part seems to understand and accept this . 
Conze’s views on involving [LOC China  ] are intriguing , given the general attitude of most [ORG EU  ] personnel here . 
Most don’t know much about [LOC PRC  ] activities , and view those they are aware of with suspicion . 
[PER Conze  ] is the first to acknowledge that [LOC China  ] too is part of the problem and could possibly be part of the solution . 
His idea of involving them in security sector reform , however , is likely to cause strong pushback from some of the more conservative [ORG EU  ] members ; and in fact , his idea of inviting the [MISC Chinese  ] ambassador to the Fishmonger’s meeting is also likely to meet some resistance . 
This promises to be an interesting food fight . 
END COMMENT .
