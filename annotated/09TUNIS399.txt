Godec  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) ------ Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [ORG International Red Cross Committee Regional  ] ( [ORG ICRC  ] ) Delegate Yves [PER Arnoldy  ] told the Ambassador [ORG ICRC  ] priorities in [LOC Tunisia  ] are overcrowding in general and treatment of prisoners in [MISC MOI  ] facilities . 
The [ORG ICRC  ] has a good working relationship with the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] , but the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] will take more time . 
He confirmed that the [ORG ICRC  ] has access to some notified [MISC MOI  ] facilities and was trying to get information about non-notified facilities . 
He also said , if offered the chance to make a recommendation about the transfer of [MISC Tunisian  ] detainees held in [LOC Guantanamo  ] back to [LOC Tunisia  ] that he , " would not like to be in the Ambassador 's place . 
" End [MISC Summary.  ] --------------------- [PER Guantanamo Detainees  ] --------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The Ambassador met recently with [ORG ICRC  ] Delegate Yves [PER Arnoldy  ] to obtain an update on the organization 's activities in [LOC Tunisia  ] and the region. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Discussing the [LOC Guantanamo  ] detention facility , the Ambassador stressed President [PER Obama  ] 's intention to close the facility by the end of the year . 
He said the question of transferring the [MISC Tunisian  ] detainees back to [LOC Tunisia  ] was under review in [LOC Washington  ] and asked what [PER Arnoldy  ] would recommend if he had the opportunity . 
[PER Arnoldy  ] responded , obliquely saying , it was a difficult decision and he " would not like to be in the Ambassador 's place . 
" He asked to be kept informed about the status of any potential transferees because [ORG ICRC  ] is in touch with their families in [LOC Tunisia  ] and will keep them informed . 
[ORG ICRC  ] will also be testing a video conferencing capability soon to improve communications between detainees still in [LOC Guantanamo  ] and their families. --------------- [ORG ICRC Activities  ] --------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Arnoldy  ] said the [ORG ICRC  ] is focused on the long-term in [LOC Tunisia  ] . 
It was only allowed access to prisoners in 2005 . 
It is a question of building trust , which takes time , but relations have reached an , " interesting level with solid ground for development particularly with the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] . 
" The [ORG ICRC  ] has two tracks it is working on , overcrowding in general , and treatment of prisoners in facilities under [MISC MOI  ] control. ------------------ Relations with [ORG MOJ  ] ------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Arnoldy  ] said the [ORG ICRC  ] relations with the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] are cooperative . 
He had direct contact whenever he needed it with his interlocutors up to the Minister , and there were clear signs of political will to cooperate on prison inspections . 
The [ORG MOJ  ] is ready to take advantage of the resources [ORG ICRC  ] has to offer and is becoming interested in a dialogue on wider issues of justice . 
He could see possibilities to develop activities with the [ORG MOJ  ] beyond just treatment of prisoners to a more strategic , structural level , including training of staff and exchange of ideas with other national systems . 
When asked by the Ambassador if he could confirm if the [MISC MOI  ] had access to prisoners held in [ORG MOJ  ] facilities he said he could not add any information to this , but then added , that certain ministries have the ability to affect the [ORG MOJ  ] system. ------------------- Relations with [MISC MOI  ] ------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Arnoldy  ] characterized [ORG ICRC  ] relations with the [MISC MOI  ] as " needing improvement . 
" The [ORG ICRC  ] is taking a step-by-step approach and the level of dialogue has made some progress since the beginning . 
However , changing treatment is a long-term issue that will entail changes in the [ORG MOJ  ] 's attitude and " mentality . 
" The [ORG ICRC  ] is seeking to improve the dialogue and develop the basis for adding more substance . 
[PER Arnoldy  ] confirmed that the [ORG ICRC  ] has access to " notified " [MISC MOI  ] facilities and was trying to get information about " non-notified " facilities. ---------------------- Relations with the [ORG MFA  ] ---------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Arnoldy  ] said he has to double track his meeting requests with the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] via diplomatic note to the [ORG MFA  ] however the [ORG MFA  ] does not block or delay his requests . 
He noted that his relationship with the [ORG MFA  ] had declined somewhat after the departure of [PER Hatem Ben Salim  ] who was the Secretary of State for [MISC European  ] Affairs until 2008. ------------------------ [ORG NGO Reports of Treatment  ] ------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The Ambassador asked [PER Arnoldy  ] for his impression of the reliability of information on treatment of prisoners provided by [ORG NGOs  ] and others without direct access to the prisoners . 
He asked if the [ORG ICRC  ] questioned their public statements about treatment . 
[PER Arnoldy  ] said , it is difficult for [ORG NGOs  ] and others to know exactly what is happening and third hand sourcing has its problems . 
Not everything they say is accurate , but it is a source of information . 
They often give him tips that he can follow-up on or verify and sometimes they do have good sources , especially through contact with prisoners' families. ------------------ [ORG Regional Activities  ] ------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The Ambassador asked for an overview of the [ORG ICRC  ] office 's regional activities , which [PER Arnoldy  ] is responsible for , in brief: -- [LOC Libya  ] - Relations are difficult . 
[PER Arnoldy  ] has a hard time visiting [LOC Libya  ] because of his [MISC Swiss  ] passport and the strained relations between [LOC Libya  ] and [LOC Switzerland  ] . 
[ORG ICRC  ] depends on [MISC Tunisian  ] staff going to [LOC Libya  ] or [MISC Libyans  ] coming to [LOC Tunisia  ] . 
-- [LOC Mauritania  ] - The [ORG ICRC  ] has signed a headquarters agreement with [LOC Mauritania  ] upgrading their status to a mission but the office will still answer to the [LOC Tunis  ] office . 
There are approximately 1,200 prisoners in [LOC Mauritania  ] . 
-- [LOC Morocco  ] - [ORG ICRC  ] has a presence in [LOC Morocco  ] but does not have any diplomatic status . 
Therefore the [LOC Morocco  ] office focuses on issues of international humanitarian law . 
The rest of [ORG ICRC  ] activities are handled through the [LOC Tunis  ] office . 
[LOC Morocco  ] is the biggest file in the region , concerned mainly individuals who " disappeared " as a result of the [LOC Western Sahara  ] conflict . 
[ORG ICRC  ] is discussing up-grading its status with the government of [LOC Morocco  ] , it is just a question of time . 
When they reach an agreement , [ORG ICRC  ] will likely open several offices in [LOC Morocco  ] which will not be dependent on the [LOC Tunis  ] office. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) [PER Arnoldy  ] expressed the [ORG ICRC  ] 's appreciation for USG support for the organization . 
The [ORG ICRC  ] depends on donors to support it so it can react quickly in a crisis and not wait until it has confirmed funding before taking action. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Arnoldy  ] was as frank as he could be given the confidentiality policy of the [ORG ICRC  ] . 
It was clear that he was not positive about the prison conditions in the [MISC MOI  ] facilities nor about the [MISC MOI  ] 's attitude toward cooperating with the [ORG ICRC  ] . 
He did say however , that some progress had been made in the [MISC ICRC-MOI  ] dialogue but that it would take time . 
Given that [ORG ICRC  ] is the only international organization with reliable access to the prisons , we have to give weight to their comments , even if cryptic .
