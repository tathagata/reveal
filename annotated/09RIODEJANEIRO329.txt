[ORG FAVELA PACIFICATION PROGRAM  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Beginning in December 2008 , [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] Governor [PER Sergio Cabral  ] , with support from [LOC Rio Mayor  ] [PER Eduardo Paes  ] , launched a comprehensive program to " pacify " [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] 's violent favelas by establishing and maintaining a sustained police and state presence . 
To date , police units have entered four such favelas - [MISC City of God  ] , [PER Jardim  ] do [MISC Batan  ] , [ORG Santa Marta  ] , and [LOC Chapeu Mangueira/Babylonia  ] - and continue to maintain a presence within them . 
While [LOC Rio  ] 's favelas have often been a target of police operations with a goal of disrupting narco-trafficking activities , the [ORG Favela Pacification Program  ] marks the first time that state , municipal , or federal authorities are attempting a " clear and hold " approach , the success of which is predicated upon pushing criminal elements out of the community , establishing a permanent police and government presence , then providing basic services and civic privileges to favela residents . 
This approach closely resembles [LOC U.S.  ] counter-insurgency doctrine in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] , and highlights the extent to which favelas have been outside state authority . 
Favelas , which first emerged in the late 19th century and grew extensively in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] over the past three decades , are urban communities of varying size whose residents generally do not hold title to their homes . 
Due to the inherently marginalized nature of favelas , various criminal elements have historically flourished within them , using the communities as platforms from which to conduct drug trafficking activities , pirate services for its residents , and launch other criminal activities throughout the city . 
There are approximately 1,000 favelas in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] , with an estimated 1 million inhabitants . 
RIO SECURITY CHIEF: " WE ARE AT WAR " <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In a September 22 meeting with Principal Officer , State Secretary for Public Security [PER Jose Beltrame  ] explained the [ORG Favela Pacification Program  ] and its importance to [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] 's overall security . 
" You cannot imagine what government neglect of the favelas have done to this city . 
It is a failure of public service , " he said . 
Stating the [LOC Rio  ] government was now " at war , " [PER Beltrame  ] explained , " We have a few hundred criminals causing terror in a few million . 
" Stating the state needed to act , he emphasized the goal of the program is not to eliminate all violence and drug trafficking in the favelas , but rather to establish a state presence that can allow for the delivery of basic services , such as trash collection , and social programs , such as health attention and education . 
Under the program , state police special operations units ( BOPE ) enter a favela by force . 
Once criminal elements that control a favela are purged , state-administered pacification police units ( [ORG UPP  ] ) then replace traditional police forces , in order to maintain order , foster long-term ties between the state and the community , and assist with the delivery of basic services to the favela . 
[LOC RIO DE JAN  ] 00000329 002 OF 004 PACIFICATION POLICE CHIEF: " WE DO NOT NEED A [MISC RAMBO  ] " <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The key component of the [ORG Favela Pacification Program  ] is the [ORG Pacification Police  ] ( [ORG UPP  ] ) . 
There are currently 500 pacification police ( [ORG UPP  ] ) officers in the four " pacified " favelas , with the number of officers assigned to each favela depending on levels of existing criminal activity . 
For example , only 55 [ORG UPP  ] officers are required to maintain order in the favela of [LOC Jardim  ] do [MISC Batan  ] which has approximately 40,000 residents , while 160 [ORG UPP  ] officers are required in the favela [ORG Santa Marta  ] , which has only 3,000 residents . 
[ORG UPP  ] commander Colonel [PER Jose Carvalho  ] - a former [ORG United Nations Peacekeeping Commander  ] - told us on August 25 that only new police academy recruits are selected into the [ORG UPP  ] program . 
" We need fresh , strong minds , not a [LOC Rambo  ] , " [PER Carvalho  ] stated . 
" The older generation of cops is more oriented to kicking down doors and shooting people . 
" Following acceptance into the [ORG UPP  ] , officers receive additional training in human rights and community outreach , in addition to community profile briefings specific to the officer 's assigned favela . 
[PER Carvalho  ] said active [ORG UPP  ] officers are also subject to internal affairs undercover operations , to ensure [ORG UPP  ] officers are not abusing their power within the favelas . 
PROGRESS , BUT MANY CHALLENGES <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) From a security perspective , the [ORG Favela Pacification Program  ] has thus far been successful in the four [LOC Rio  ] favelas under [ORG UPP  ] control , but the subsequent delivery of basic services and social programs appears to be uneven . 
BOPE Lieutenant Wolney [PER Francisco de Paula  ] told us on August 19 that BOPE units entering the favelas encountered no resistance from the narco-trafficking gangs that had de facto control of the communities , while [ORG UPP  ] Colonel [PER Carvalho  ] claimed there have been no [MISC UPP-related  ] fatalities in the favelas under pacification . 
That said , the delivery of basic services and implementation of social programs are reported to be uneven among the four favelas . 
[PER Carvalho  ] explained , for example , that his officers had to quell a near riot in the [PER Chapeu Mangueira/Babylonia  ] favela , after its residents protested that they were not receiving equal benefits as other " pacified " favelas . 
[PER Carvalho  ] blamed the [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] state government for failing to provide essential services , stating " There are no services there , and the state is not organized enough to provide them . 
" Favela representatives , while generally supporting the pacification program , universally cite the need for more social programs and basic services . 
During a September 18 symposium on favela development sponsored by the [ORG BNDES  ] - the [MISC Brazilian  ] development bank - [LOC Rio  ] favela resident association representatives recognized efforts by the state , municipal , and federal governments to address the plight of the favelas , but voiced concerns over how money was being spent . 
For example , a community leader from pacified favela [ORG Santa Marta  ] , [PER Jose Mario  ] dos [PER Santos  ] , questioned why state money was being used to construct a wall around that community . 
[ORG Rosino de  ] [PER Castro Diniz  ] , president of the [ORG Federation of Favela Associations  ] in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] , told us the pacification program could not succeed without a concerted effort to provide jobs and social services to residents. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Another significant factor for the project 's success will be how receptive favela residents are to assuming civic responsibilities , such as paying for legitimate services and taxes . 
BOPE Lieutenant [PER Francisco  ] de [PER Paula  ] , who is also a resident of the [PER Jardim  ] de [MISC Batan  ] favela , told us many in his community were resistant to the idea of having to switch from paying pirated sources of services , such as electricity and water , to higher-priced legitimate providers . 
[PER Carvalho  ] also said his officers encountered wide-spread confusion among residents that , until now , have been paying for electricity and cable TV service through pirated sources . 
" It is very difficult for them to all of a sudden have to pay for services they previously received for less or even free , " he said . 
[PER Carvalho  ] also lamented the overall mentality of favela residents who lived for decades under the sway of narco-trafficking groups . 
" This generation is lost , " he said . 
" We need to focus on children through providing sports and education programs . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Security experts see a possible link between the pacification program and an increase in crime in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] 's more affluent neighborhoods , such as Ipanema , Leblon , and [LOC Copacabana  ] , collectively known as " [MISC Zona Sul  ] . 
" [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] 's [ORG Public Security Institute  ] ( [ORG ISP  ] ) reported a 50 percent increase in residential theft and a 52 percent in [ORG RIO DE JAN  ] 00000329 003 OF 004 robberies of businesses in [PER Zona Sul  ] from December 2008 to July 2009 , compared with the same period the year prior . 
[PER Julita Lemgruber  ] , director for the [ORG Center for Security and Civics  ] ( [ORG CESEC  ] ) and a former police ombudsman , said this increase was due to drug traffickers - forced out of the drug trade in UPP-occupied favelas - now branching out into other criminal activities outside of the favelas . 
[PER Beltrame  ] had a similar theory , explaining the structure of narco-trafficking networks played a role in the increase . 
" When we hit these guys at the top , they lose jobs at the bottom . 
This results in more street crime . 
" <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Wilson Carlos Carvalho  ] , a senior adviser to Governor [PER Cabral  ] on security matters , told us on August 28 that the federal government needed to do more to assist with the favela problem and the crime increasing in other parts of the city , highlighting the large flow of arms and drugs into [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] . 
" We do not have any arms factories or coca fields in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] . 
More needs to be done to control the borders , " he said ( [PER Note: Beltrame  ] also expressed concern over the proliferation of military-grade weapons in [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] , and said most illegal arms were of [MISC American  ] origin and issued to foreign armies , such as [LOC Colombia  ] , [LOC Bolivia  ] , and [LOC Paraguay  ] . 
End Note ) . 
EXPANDING THE PACIFICATION <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) State Security Secretary [PER Beltrame  ] offered to share the strategic plan for the favela program with Consulate officers and to take the PO into a " pacified " favela in the near future . 
[PER Beltrame  ] stated of the 50 favelas he envisions pacified by the end of 2010 , " [ORG Complexo de Alemao  ] " was the principal target . 
The [ORG Complexo de Alemao  ] is an enormous favela with over 200,000 residents and heavily armed criminal groups entrenched . 
The scope of an operation into [ORG Complexo de Alemao  ] would be vast and the scale of violence potentially " traumatic , " [PER Beltrame  ] said . 
[PER Beltrame  ] seemed determined , however , noting the operation would likely take place in early 2010 . 
" This favela is totally outside of state authority , and it is the epicenter of the fight , " he stated . 
Although [PER Wilson Carlos Carvalho  ] , the [PER Cabral  ] adviser , told us that the [ORG Intelligence Branch of the State Secretariat  ] for [ORG Public Security  ] had mapped more than 90 favelas in the city for eventual [ORG UPP  ] operations , [PER Beltrame  ] said only 10-12 favelas , including [ORG Complexo de Alemao  ] , would be critical to the program . 
" We do not need to take over 100 favelas . 
The real violence is concentrated in only about a dozen , " he explained . 
In order to meet the manpower requirements for extending the pacification program , [PER Wilson Carlos Carvalho  ] said the [ORG Military Police  ] would recruit 7,000 new police officers , 3,500 of whom would join the [ORG UPP  ] ranks by next year . 
[PER Beltrame  ] 's estimate of police recruitment was more expansive , with a projection of 30,000 new police officers on [LOC Rio  ] 's streets by 2016 . 
ECONOMICS OF FAVELA PACIFICATION <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In addition to the security factors involved with the pacification program , there are also significant economic interests at stake . 
Some economists have forecast an increase of 90 million [MISC Brazilian  ] Reals ( 45 million [MISC USD  ] ) in new property and service taxes that would go towards the [LOC Rio  ] municipal government , should all favelas come under the authority of [LOC Rio  ] state . 
The president of [LOC Rio  ] electricity provider " [PER Light  ] " estimated the economy of [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] could grow by around 38 billion [MISC Brazilian  ] Reals ( 21 billion [MISC USD  ] ) through increased commerce and new jobs . 
According to [PER Andre Urani  ] , an economist with the [ORG Institute of Labor and Social Research  ] ( [ORG IETS  ] ) , [PER Light  ] loses at least 200 million [MISC USD  ] per year due to pirated electricity in the favelas ( [PER Note: Light  ] donated 600 low energy consumption refrigerators to residents in [LOC Santa Marta  ] favela , in order to encourage their integration as utility customers . 
End Note ) . 
Emphasizing the potential market in favelas , [PER Urani  ] stated , " Imagine the revenue increase if [PER Light  ] could successfully turn the one million illegal users of its services into customers . 
" According to data provided by the [ORG Rio State Secretariat for Security  ] , operations to fully pacify and reintegrate favelas would cost the state between 90 million to 340 million [MISC Brazilian  ] Reals ( 48 million to 183 million [MISC USD  ] ) . 
COMMENT <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Favela Pacification Program  ] shares some characteristics with [LOC U.S.  ] counter-insurgency strategy in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Like counter-insurgency , the [LOC RIO DE JAN  ] 00000329 004 OF 004 population is the true center of gravity , and the program 's success will ultimately depend not only on effective and sustained coordination between the police and state/municipal governments , but on favela residents' perception of the legitimacy of state . 
One of the principal challenges in this project is to convince favela populations that the benefits of submitting to state authority ( security , legitimate land ownership , access to education ) outweigh the costs ( taxes , utility fees , civil obedience ) . 
As with [MISC American  ] counter-insurgency doctrine , we should not expect results overnight . 
If the program is limited to Governor [PER Cabral  ] 's 2010 reelection campaign or constitutes little more than an initiative crafted to bolster [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] 's 2016 bid for the [MISC Olympics  ] , as some critics have charged , it offers little chance of success . 
If , however , the program wins over " hearts and minds " in the favelas , and continues to enjoy genuine support from the governor and the mayor , bolstered by private enterprise lured by the prospects of reintegrating some one million favela residents into mainstream markets , this program could remake the social and economic fabric of [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] . 
Post will work closely with the relevant state authorities to facilitate exchanges , seminars , and institutional partnerships towards this end .
