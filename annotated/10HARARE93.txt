<code><pre>Wednesday , 10 February 2010 , 13:00 C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 [LOC HARARE  ] 000093 SIPDIS AF/S FOR [MISC BRIAN WALCH  ] NSC FOR SENIOR AFRICA DIRECTOR MICHELLE GAVIN ADDIS FOR USAU EO 12958 DECL: 2020/02/10 TAGS PREL , PGOV , ZI SUBJECT: XXXXXXXXXXXX’s observations on the political landscape and [MISC U.S.-Zimbabwe  ] relations REF: [LOC HARARE  ] 87 ; [LOC HARARE  ] 36 CLASSIFIED BY: [PER Charles A. Ray  ] , Ambassador , STATE , EXEC ; REASON: 1.4 ( B ) , ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Pol/econ chief met February 9 with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] offered his observations on various topics including the state of [LOC ZANU-PF  ] , indigenization , and elections. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC ZANU-PF  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] described the party as badly fractured . 
It was like a stick of TNT , susceptible to ignition and disintegration . 
[MISC ZANU-PF  ] was holding together because of the threat of [MISC MDC-T  ] and foreign pressure . 
He likened [MISC ZANU-PF  ] to a troop of baboons incessantly fighting among themselves , but coming together to face an external threat . 
New leadership was essential and would emerge as some of the old timers , including [PER Robert Mugabe  ] , left the scene . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] opined that Vice President [PER Joice Mujuru  ] or [PER S.K. Moyo  ] ( former ambassador to [MISC South African  ] and now party chair ) were possibilities , although Mujuru’s fear of [PER Mugabe  ] was affecting her ability to lead. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC MDC-T  ] . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [MISC MDC-T  ] is alienating supporters because of corruption . 
He pointed to the [LOC Harare  ] suburb of [LOC Chitungwiza  ] where [MISC MDC-T  ] is investigating its councilors for being on the take . 
Residents of [LOC Chitungwiza  ] blame the party . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] commented that part of the problem was that many [MISC MDC-T  ] local councilors and parliamentarians elected in 2008 had no independent income . 
Unable to survive on their [MISC US$200/month  ] salaries , they were now turning to graft . 
He also noted that the national party was not enabling parliamentarians to demonstrate , e.g. by bringing home pork , that they were working for their constituents. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Elections . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] believed elections would take place in 2012 or 2013 . 
Parliamentarians from all parties , particularly those who had no income before coming into office , had no interest in running again before necessary . 
They would try to stall the constitutional process. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Global Political Agreement ( [ORG GPA  ] ) . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] thought there would be slow progress . 
In his opinion , the most important achievement of the [ORG GPA  ] was the sidelining of [ORG Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe  ] Governor [PER Gideon Gono.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Indigenization . 
Taking an opposite view to Minister of Youth and Indigenization Saviour Kasukuwere ( Ref A ) , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the government’s indigenization program benefitted nobody accept those who were already wealthy . 
It did nothing for his constituents , who couldn’t afford to buy into companies and were living hand-to-mouth. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Economic Recovery . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said a primary focus should be communal lands where 80 percent of [MISC Zimbabweans  ] live . 
Before the economy collapsed , he said the communal areas produced 80 percent of farm output consumed in the country . 
( NOTE: These numbers are indicative but not accurate . 
More than 30 percent of [MISC Zimbabweans  ] live in urban areas , so somewhat less than 80 percent live on communal lands . 
But communal lands have long been the main source of [LOC Zimbabwe’s  ] domestic food supply . 
END NOTE . 
) Production dramatically decreased with the collapse of the economy as small farmers were no longer able to access inputs . 
Another factor was the [ORG Grain Marketing Board’s  ] requirement that crops be sold to it . 
It then failed to pay farmers . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that international assistance would be necessary to resuscitate the economy . 
But [LOC HARARE  ] 00000093 002 OF 002 lesser steps were important . 
He volunteered that the Ambassador’s [MISC Self Help Program  ] had once been present in communal areas . 
It was a powerful indication of [LOC U.S.  ] interest in helping [MISC Zimbabweans  ] , and was of tremendous assistance to those who benefitted from projects. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Sanctions and [PER ZDERA  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said sanctions on individuals should remain if justified by the behavior of these individuals . 
Sanctions on parastatals that were contributing or could contribute to the economy should be lifted . 
With regard to [PER ZDERA  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] acknowledged that the [ORG IMF  ] and [ORG World Bank  ] had ceased activities in [LOC Zimbabwe  ] before [PER ZDERA  ] was enacted . 
The economy was already on a downhill trajectory because of misguided economic policies and the disastrous land reform policy . 
But the passage of [PER ZDERA  ] was like slashing an already deflating tire . 
Many [MISC Zimbabweans  ] viewed [PER ZDERA  ] as an attempt to hurt them when they were already suffering . 
As such , said [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER ZDERA  ] has a large symbolic value and should be repealed. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ------------- COMMENT ------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) XXXXXXXXXXXX’s comments on [MISC ZANU-PF  ] are representative of a large part of the party . 
There is little doubt that if a secret party election were held , [PER Mugabe  ] and his inner circle would lose their positions . 
But [PER Mugabe  ] , aided by the securocrats and through fear , still has control . 
On sanctions and [PER ZDERA  ] , most [MISC ZANU-PF  ] members , even moderates , tell us they believe sanctions , especially on parastatals , and [PER ZDERA  ] have hurt the economy ( though they cannot cite evidence for this claim ) . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX’s view is more nuanced than most . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX’s view on [PER ZDERA  ] is what many in the [MISC MDC-T  ] have been telling us: It is serving no real purpose other than to provide a convenient whipping boy for [MISC ZANU-PF  ] .
