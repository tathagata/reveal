( C ) SUMMARY: According to his adviser on [LOC Cuba  ] , [MISC European  ] Commissioner for Development [PER Louis Michel  ] believes the [ORG EU  ] must bolster [MISC Cuban  ] FM [PER Felipe Perez Roque  ] as the best hope for improved [MISC EU-Cuba  ] relations . 
During his March 24-27 visit to the island ( REFS B-C ) , [PER Michel  ] offered [PER Perez Roque  ] better relations with the [ORG EU  ] , apparently implying that the [ORG EU  ] wished to offset the [LOC U.S.  ] embargo . 
[PER Michel  ] reportedly was struck by the " frozen " world-view of the other [MISC Cuban  ] officials he met , including [PER Castro  ] , who appeared to believe [LOC Cuba  ] 's relationships with [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC China  ] rendered closer relations with the [ORG EU  ] unnecessary . 
[PER Michel  ] 's analysis of [MISC EU-Cuba  ] relations seems unaffected by his meetings with the opposition . 
He believes the [LOC U.S.  ] embargo soured the [MISC Communist  ] experiment on the island , and that " constructive engagement " with [LOC Cuba  ] is the [ORG EU  ] 's only alternative . 
His view has the upper hand in the [ORG EU  ] , but continued [MISC Cuban  ] intransigence could result in pressure to toughen [ORG EU  ] policy by the time of the [ORG EU  ] 's June/July [LOC Cuba  ] policy review . 
END SUMMARY. ---------------------- A CONFIDENTIAL READOUT ---------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( STRICTLY PROTECT ) , who covers [LOC Cuba  ] in the cabinet of [MISC European  ] Commissioner for Development [PER Louis Michel  ] , called [PER Poloff  ] on April 14 for a " confidential " readout of [PER Michel  ] 's March 24-27 visit to [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] accompanied [PER Michel  ] to the island and attended all of his meetings except the encounter with [PER Castro  ] . 
During his trip [PER Michel  ] met with [PER Perez Roque  ] , Vice President of the [ORG Council of State Carlos Lage  ] , [ORG National Assembly  ] President [PER Ricardo Alarcon  ] , Minister of Foreign Investment and [ORG Economic Cooperation Marta Lomas  ] and , for three hours , with [PER Fidel Castro  ] . 
In addition , [PER Michel  ] met Cardinal [PER Jaime Ortega  ] and [MISC Cuban  ] opposition figures [PER Oswaldo Paya  ] , [PER Marta Beatriz Roque  ] , [PER Vladimiro Roca  ] and the Women in [LOC White  ] , a group of wives and family members of imprisoned dissidents . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he had offered the readout to assure [PER Poloff  ] that [PER Michel  ] fully shared the objective of democratic transition in [LOC Cuba  ] and had reasons for his differences with the [LOC U.S.  ] on tactics. --------------------------- [PER PEREZ  ] ROQUE: THE GREAT HOPE --------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] repeated often that [PER Perez Roque  ] was the only [MISC Cuban  ] official [PER Michel  ] met with whom it was possible to have a give-and-take discussion . 
[PER Perez Roque  ] appeared to be looking ahead to a post-Castro era , and thinking pragmatically about how to pursue [LOC Cuba  ] 's present and future interests . 
In this context , he listened with interest to [PER Michel  ] 's suggestion that [LOC Cuba  ] join the [ORG Cotonou Agreement  ] and thereby establish a comprehensive basis for closer political , trade and development-assistance relations with the [ORG EU  ] . 
( NOTE: The [ORG Cotonou Agreement  ] is the framework for development-assistance , trade and political relations between the [ORG EU  ] and the 79 members of the [MISC African  ] , [LOC Caribbean  ] and [ORG Pacific Group of States  ] . 
In exchange for a more favorable trade and aid relationship , [LOC Cotonou  ] would commit [LOC Cuba  ] to a regular political and human rights dialogue with the [ORG EU  ] . 
END NOTE . 
) According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER Michel  ] told [PER Perez Roque  ] that a [MISC Cotonou-based  ] relationship with the [ORG EU  ] could act as a counterbalance to [LOC Cuba  ] 's isolation from the [LOC U.S.  ] He further suggested that , under [LOC Cotonou  ] , the [ORG EU  ] might be able to help the [MISC Cubans  ] in sending medical doctors to countries in the region , as they are doing in [LOC Venezuela.  ] ------------------------------ [PER PEREZ  ] [PER ROQUE  ] NONCOMMITTAL TO [ORG EU  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Perez Roque  ] 's response to the [LOC Cotonou  ] offer was noncommittal . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the [MISC Cuban  ] FM 's negotiating style could be described as " I'll tell you the time if you give me your watch . 
" In that spirit , [PER Perez Roque  ] repeatedly told [PER Michel  ] the prerequisite for closer [MISC EU-Cuba  ] ties was the [ORG EU  ] 's dropping support for the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG CHR  ] resolution on [LOC Cuba  ] . 
Denying that [PER Michel  ] had ever advocated dropping support , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that [PER Michel  ] 's response was always that ( 1 ) [LOC Cuba  ] must release its imprisoned dissidents ; and ( 2 ) since the [ORG CHR  ] resolution was purely procedural , the [ORG EU  ] could not fail to support it . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Michel  ] raised the possibility of [LOC Cuba  ] 's inviting [ORG UN  ] High Commissioner for [ORG Human Rights  ] [PER Louise Arbour  ] or her [LOC Cuba  ] Representative [PER Christine Chanet  ] to visit the island , in order to signal [LOC Cuba  ] 's desire to work with the international community . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER Perez Roque  ] said he would consider the idea but never followed up. ----------------------------------------- MICHEL'S EFFUSIVENESS WAS FOR [LOC PEREZ  ] [PER ROQUE  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Michel  ] was quite aware that trying to buttress [PER Perez Roque  ] was a risk . 
No one could be sure whether he was acting in good faith in his contacts with the [ORG EU  ] , or simply " the smartest " member of a completely intransigent regime . 
Nonetheless , [PER Michel  ] felt that [PER Perez Roque  ] represented the [ORG EU  ] 's only hope of influencing [LOC Cuba  ] toward reform and respect for human rights . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Michel  ] 's effusive public optimism about [MISC EU-Cuba  ] relations after the visit was meant to bolster [PER Perez Roque  ] . 
In reality , said [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER Michel  ] came away sobered and distressed . 
[PER Perez Roque  ] would have to come through soon , said [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , by freeing more dissidents or allowing the [ORG UN  ] human rights visit , or [PER Michel  ] and the [MISC Spaniards  ] would no longer be able to advocate full constructive engagement . 
When pressed on whether " soon " meant before the upcoming June/July review of [ORG EU  ] [LOC Cuba  ] policy , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , " we'll probably have to give him more time than that . 
" ---------------------------------- MICHEL: [PER CASTRO  ] , OTHERS , DELUSIONAL ---------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was at pains to contrast [PER Perez Roque  ] with the other [MISC Cuban  ] officials they had met . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Michel  ] was struck by how " frozen " and delusional [MISC Cuban  ] officials' view of the world was . 
The meeting with Vice President of the [ORG Council of State Carlos Lage  ] was emblematic of this , said [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
[ORG Lage  ] seemed truly to believe that all was well on the island , that time was on [LOC Cuba  ] 's side regarding the [LOC U.S.  ] embargo , that the [MISC Cuban  ] peso revaluation would make the economy strong and , above all , that [LOC Cuba  ] 's growing relations with [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC China  ] rendered closer relations with the [ORG EU  ] unnecessary . 
Although [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] did not attend the meeting with [PER Castro  ] , [PER Michel  ] told him the three-hour encounter started with an almost surreal tour through a room [PER Castro  ] had showcasing [MISC Chinese  ] products as if it were a museum exhibition . 
[PER Castro  ] , too , seemed fixated on [LOC Venezuela  ] and [LOC China  ] . 
Although the [PER Alarcon  ] meeting was less substantive , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER Alarcon  ] expressed views similar to [ORG Lage  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said Minister of Foreign Investment and [ORG Economic Cooperation Marta Lomas  ] was the most wooden of all , sticking so close to her talking points that no exchange was possible. ------------------------------------- MICHEL: EMBARGO FEEDS [MISC CUBAN  ] DELUSIONS ------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stressed that a central element of the official [ORG Cubans'  ] world-view was the [LOC U.S.  ] embargo . 
The [MISC Cuban  ] David had weathered the [MISC American  ] Goliath 's embargo for forty years , proving the regime 's strength and lending it moral legitimacy . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Michel  ] felt vindicated in his opposition to the embargo , since he had now witnessed the role it played in [MISC Cuban  ] officials' delusions . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added that [PER Michel  ] believed that Communism might have turned out well for [LOC Cuba  ] if the embargo had not helped push the regime down the hard-line path . 
This was yet another reason , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , to choose a [LOC Cuba  ] policy of engagement rather than isolation. ------------------------------------------- OPPOSITION: LITTLE EFFECT ON MICHEL'S VIEWS ------------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Michel  ] 's analysis of [MISC EU-Cuba  ] relations seems unaffected by his meetings with the opposition and the Church . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [PER Michel  ] had three separate meetings with dissidents , one with [PER Oswaldo Paya  ] , another with [PER Marta Beatriz Roque  ] and [PER Vladimiro Roca  ] , and a third with the Women in [LOC White  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said little of note was discussed during the [PER Paya  ] meeting , and that [PER Roca  ] was the only opposition figure who completely opposed the lifting of the [ORG EU  ] measures . 
[PER Beatriz Roque  ] , said [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , opposed it as well , but was willing to wait and see what the upshot would be . 
The Women in [LOC White  ] made a deep impression on [PER Michel  ] , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , with their personal stories . 
However , they did not discuss policy . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had little of substance to say about [PER Michel  ] 's meeting with [ORG Cardinal Jaime Ortega.  ] --------------------------------------- [PER MICHEL  ] GOING TO MAT FOR FULL ENGAGEMENT --------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) COMMENT: [PER Michel  ] apparently will stop supporting full constructive engagement with [LOC Cuba  ] only if [MISC Cuban  ] intransigence -- and pressure from within the [ORG EU  ] -- makes his position politically untenable . 
He is also willing to sell the [ORG EU  ] approach to the [MISC Cubans  ] as a counterweight to the [LOC U.S.  ] embargo . 
Our sense is that this attitude , buttressed by [MISC Spanish  ] support , is still carrying the day in the [ORG EU  ] . 
( NOTE: On April 15 , [PER Perez Roque  ] called [ORG EU  ] support for the [ORG CHR  ] resolution on [LOC Cuba  ] " pathetic ; " a [ORG Commission  ] spokeswoman 's response was to say that the [ORG EU  ] supported the resolution because it did not condemn the [MISC Cuban  ] authorities . 
END NOTE . 
) As the June/July review of [ORG EU  ] [LOC Cuba  ] policy approaches , the commitment of anti-Castro member states such as the [LOC Czech Republic  ] and [LOC Poland  ] , and , in [LOC Brussels  ] , of the center-right activists in the [MISC European  ] [ORG Parliament  ] ( [ORG REF  ] A ) will be key . 
If the [PER Castro  ] regime remains as uncompromising as it has been in its reaction to the [ORG CHR  ] resolution , they might have a window of opportunity to modify the current policy of full engagement . 
END COMMENT .
