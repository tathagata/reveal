( [ORG SBU  ] ) Your visit to [LOC Lisbon  ] comes on the heels of the most closely contested parliamentary election in many years . 
With the September 27 parliamentary elections just days away , the Socialists led by Prime Minister [PER Jose Socrates  ] have a ten-point lead over the [MISC Social Democrats  ] led by former Finance Minister [PER Manuela Ferreira Leite  ] . 
However , a significant portion of the electorate -- approximately 24 percent of those intending to vote -- remains undecided and could sway the final result . 
Both leading parties support our bilateral relationship , and we expect [LOC Portugal  ] to remain a close [ORG EU  ] and [ORG NATO  ] partner . 
[LOC PORTUGAL  ] - STEADFAST ALLY ------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Portugal  ] , a founding member of [ORG NATO  ] , is a steadfast ally that has consistently stood by our side over the years despite changes in government . 
President [PER Cavaco Silva  ] and Prime Minister [PER Socrates  ] ( at this date ) -- from opposing political parties -- both regularly stress that the transatlantic relationship is a pillar of [MISC Portuguese  ] foreign policy and that [ORG NATO  ] is the primary guarantor of [MISC European  ] security . 
[LOC Portugal  ] is also a member of the [ORG Proliferation Security Initiative  ] , the [ORG Container Security Initiative/Megaports  ] , and the [ORG Global Initiative  ] to [ORG Combat Nuclear Terrorism.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC C  ] ) [LOC Portugal  ] has taken a leading role supporting [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to close the detention center at [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
Foreign Ministry [PER Luis Amado  ] was the first to publicly call on the [ORG EU  ] to help resettle detainees , and on August 28 [LOC Portugal  ] received two detainees for resettlement . 
The [MISC GOP  ] has indicated some willingness to accept a third detainee but the issue is still being reviewed . 
INTERNATIONAL MILITARY ENGAGEMENT --------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Portuguese  ] government provides liberal access to [MISC Portuguese  ] air and seaports for [LOC U.S.  ] military operations in support of our efforts in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
This year 2,557 [LOC U.S.  ] military aircraft have flown over Portuguese-controlled airspace and 1,103 have transited through [LOC Lajes Air Base  ] in the [LOC Azores.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Portuguese  ] military is engaged internationally on numerous fronts . 
[LOC Portugal  ] participates in [ORG NATO  ] 's efforts in [LOC Kosovo  ] ( 296 ) and [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( 143 in place , with a commitment to double its contingent ) , as well as the [ORG UN  ] mission in [LOC Lebanon  ] ( 147 ) . 
[LOC Portugal  ] participates in the [ORG EUFOR  ] mission in [LOC Bosnia  ] ( 14 ) , provides 87 personnel to support bilateral cooperation in five [MISC Lusophone African  ] nations and [LOC Congo  ] ( [ORG EUSEC  ] ) , and has 164 military and national guard personnel policing in [LOC Timor Leste  ] . 
INTERNAL POLITICS - GOVERNING FROM THE CENTER --------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Portugal  ] 's charismatic Prime Minister [PER Jose Socrates  ] heads [LOC Portugal  ] 's moderate Socialist government , which assumed power in March 2005 . 
The Socialists won an absolute majority in parliament for the first time in the party 's history , which has allowed [PER Socrates  ] to govern from the center without coalitions and helped him implement an economic reform agenda . 
By the end of 2007 the government had succeeded in reducing the budget deficit below the [MISC EU-mandated  ] limit of three percent , a year ahead of schedule . 
Since the onset of the global financial crisis , however , the budget deficit and unemployment rate have again increased and are projected at 6 percent and over 10 percent respectively by yearend. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Portugal  ] has national parliamentary elections and local elections for municipal officials , on September 27 and October 11 , respectively . 
Despite the economic situation and an ongoing corruption investigation , the Socialists are leading in the polls by a three-point margin over the center-right [ORG Social Democratic  ] opposition led by former Finance and Education Minister [PER Manuela Ferreira Leite  ] . 
Possible post-electoral scenarios include a [MISC Social Democrat  ] or Socialist minority government or a coalition government comprised of one of the major parties and one or two of the smaller parties . 
The new government , regardless of the party in power , will likely face difficulties in passing measures through parliament , which may force negotiations on the left and right . 
However , [MISC GOP  ] cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] and support for the [ORG EU  ] and [ORG NATO  ] will likely continue unchanged . 
MULTILATERALIST TO THE CORE [LOC LISBON  ] 00000514 002 OF 002 --------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Portugal  ] places great emphasis on multilateral institutions , the [ORG European Union  ] foremost among them . 
[LOC Portugal  ] joined the [ORG EU  ] in 1986 , and a subsequent infusion of [ORG EU  ] funds made possible the construction of [LOC Portugal  ] 's national transportation infrastructure . 
[LOC Portugal  ] remains a net recipient of [ORG EU  ] funds , and a large majority of the public views the [ORG EU  ] favorably . 
In fact , [MISC Social Democrat  ] [PER Manuel Durao Barroso  ] abandoned his prime ministership halfway through his term in 2004 in order to assume the presidency of the [ORG European Commission  ] ( [ORG EC  ] ) . 
On September 16 [PER Barroso  ] was re-elected president of the [ORG EC  ] . 
On most important foreign policy issues , [LOC Portugal  ] defers to [ORG EU  ] consensus . 
There are some exceptions , such as issues concerning lusophone [LOC Africa  ] , on which [LOC Portugal  ] seeks a leadership role . 
FOREIGN MINISTER [PER AMADO  ] ---------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Foreign Minister [PER Luis Amado  ] has been a great friend of the [LOC U.S.  ] , both in his previous capacity as Minister of Defense and now as Foreign Minister . 
He is even-tempered , thoughtful , and low-key , and regularly seeks opportunities to coordinate policy with the [LOC U.S.  ] He places great importance on presenting a united public front , whether within the [ORG EU  ] , [ORG NATO  ] or with the [LOC U.S.  ] If there are differences , he prefers to discuss them discreetly . 
He met with Secretary [PER Clinton  ] in [LOC Washington  ] on June 5 . 
He is likely to step down after the September elections . 
PRIME MINISTER [PER SOCRATES  ] ----------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) PM [PER Jose Socrates  ] is a charismatic leader who worked hard to improve his [MISC English  ] in advance of [LOC Portugal  ] 's 2007 [ORG EU  ] presidency . 
He relies on advice from a small circle of advisors and is a moderate Socialist who has been successful at co-opting or marginalizing the extremists in his party . 
He also aggressively pursued his domestic agenda before assuming the [ORG EU  ] presidency , achieving difficult labor , educational , and social security reforms . 
[PER Socrates  ] spends most of his time on the domestic agenda , leaving foreign policy largely in the hands of FM [PER Amado  ] . 
Economic diplomacy has been a cornerstone of [MISC Socrates'  ] foreign policy and this government has strengthened ties with [LOC Angola  ] , [LOC Libya  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , and [LOC China  ] to expand [LOC Portugal  ] 's energy sources and export markets . 
PRESIDENT CAVACO [PER SILVA  ] ---------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Anibal Cavaco Silva  ] is the most popular politician in [LOC Portugal  ] , although in recent weeks a front-page wiretapping scandal and his refusal to clarify the issue have threatened his popularity . 
The [MISC Portuguese  ] presidency does not wield the executive power of the [LOC U.S.  ] presidency , but the position is not ceremonial . 
[PER Cavaco Silva  ] is commander in chief of the armed forces and must approve military deployments . 
He also chairs the Council of [LOC State  ] , which handles all constitutional issues . 
[PER Cavaco Silva  ] hails from the right-of-center [MISC Social Democratic  ] party and he often butts heads with Socialist PM [PER Socrates  ] . 
But [PER Cavaco Silva  ] generally strives to be a non-partisan Head of [LOC State  ] , and leaves day-to-day politicking to his party leaders in parliament .
