<code><pre>UNCLAS [LOC MADRID  ] 000572 SIPDIS SENSITIVE DEPT FOR DS/DSS/P/DP , DS/DSS/P/PL , [LOC DS/DSS/ITA  ] , [PER DS/IP/EUR E.O.  ] 12958: [PER N/A TAGS:  ] <a href='/tag/ASEC_0.html'>ASEC</a> SUBJECT: PERSONAL PROTECTION REQUEST FOR [MISC SPANISH  ] ANTI-TERRORISM JUDGE D. [PER BALTASAR GARZON  ] REAL <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG RSO  ] has received a letter from the [ORG Spanish Ministry of Interior  ] , Secretary of [ORG State for Security  ] , requesting that the [ORG Diplomatic Security Service  ] provide protective security services for [MISC Spanish  ] Anti-Terrorism Judge [PER Baltasar Garzon  ] . 
Judge [PER Garzon  ] will be a long-term guest lecturer at [LOC New York University  ] 's [PER King Juan Carlos Center  ] for nine months from February 28 , 2005 until December 01 , 2005 . 
His classes will deal with terrorism and national security issues. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Judge [PER Garzon  ] is considered a critical threat profile Judge due to his on-going oversight and involvement in highly-visible terrorism cases including the September 11 , 2001 [ORG Trade Tower  ] bombings as connected to the [MISC Moroccan  ] [ORG Al-Qaida  ] cell known as the [PER Barakat Yarkas  ] group. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In the letter received , the [MISC Spanish  ] Secretary of [ORG State for Security  ] highlights what they consider to be the risks and considerations that come with the public exposure of Judge [PER Garzon  ] 's work in [LOC New York City  ] and requests a permanent security presence for him . 
The GOS is committed to provide two armed [MISC Spanish  ] Police to Judge [PER Garzon  ] full time but believe that a [LOC U.S.  ] law enforcement presence is essential for coordination and effectiveness. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In discussions on February 11 with the [MISC Spanish  ] Police Chief for [ORG Protective Service  ] , [PER Angel Quintana  ] , the [ORG RSO  ] explained that due to extreme demand on DSS manpower , it was unlikely that 2 DSS Agents could be provided full time , and that it was also unlikely that even a single agent could be dedicated for nine months to this detail . 
The [ORG RSO  ] opined that the more likely scenario would be an accessible agent for coordination , communication and problem solving out of [ORG DP  ] or PL. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Due to the limited planning time ( February 28 departure ) , [ORG RSO  ] requests urgent consideration be given to this request with a rapid response to the [ORG RSO  ] for the [ORG Spanish Protective Police  ] travel and visa requirement planning , keeping the [MISC Spanish  ] Embassy in [LOC Washington  ] and the [MISC Spanish  ] Consulate in [LOC New York  ] in the loop .
