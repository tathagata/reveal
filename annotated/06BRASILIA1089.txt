Science Counselor met on June 1 with [ORG Paulo  ] [PER Rogerio Goncalves  ] , Director of International Relations for [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Ministry of Science and Technology  ] . 
[PER Goncalves  ] said that Minister of Science and Technology [PER Rezende  ] had asked his scientists to quickly develop a non-paper to address how [LOC Brazil  ] envisioned technical collaboration with the [LOC United States  ] in ethanol/biofuels . 
While awaiting that document , [PER Goncalves  ] spoke in general terms about [LOC Brazil  ] 's overall vision. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
[PER Goncalves  ] said that [LOC Brazil  ] does not want to be in the position of trying to supply the world with ethanol , if it tried the country would become one large sugar cane plantation and would not be able to feed its own people . 
In addition , [LOC Brazil  ] would always be open to the risk of a virus destroying much of their yield , although it had tried to minimize that risk by developed nearly 100 different strains of sugar cane ( some better for fuel , others better for consumption ) . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] scientists would like to work with their [LOC U.S.  ] counterparts to possibly develop a fuel that would serve the consumption needs of both countries , and perhaps the world . 
He was aware that the product produced in [LOC Brazil  ] now may not be suitable for colder climates . 
[PER Goncalves  ] recounted an experience years ago when he lived in the south of [LOC Brazil  ] , where the colder temperatures during winter caused his ethanol-fueled car not to start. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
[PER Goncalves  ] , who last week accompanied Minister [PER Rezende  ] on a visit to [LOC Europe  ] , said he understood that the [LOC United States  ] needed more specific information about possible technical collaboration because each country has different needs . 
While in [LOC London  ] , he said , the [MISC Brits  ] expressed a desire to collaborate with [LOC Brazil  ] on ethanol , he heard the same thing in [LOC Brussels  ] . 
Each one of those relationships will be different , he said. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
In related stories , the May 26 issue of the newspaper [LOC Estado de Sao Paulo  ] , ran an article saying that [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC France  ] planned to announce during the upcoming [MISC G-8  ] meeting in [LOC St. Petersburg  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , the creation of an international fund for the dissemination of ethanol technology in developing countries . 
According to the article , this is part of an effort by the government of [LOC Brazil  ] to transform ethanol into a commodity and to encourage developed economies to collaborate with poorer countries . 
Another objective mentioned in the article was to raise the value of sugar cane produced in countries in [LOC Africa  ] and the [LOC Caribbean  ] , and to reduce the dependence of these nations on petroleum . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's President [PER Lula  ] and [MISC French  ] President [PER Chirac  ] signed this agreement on May 25. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
Two major [MISC Brazilian  ] dailies reported on June 2 that [LOC Japan  ] will invest approximately [MISC US$500  ] million in bioenergy in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The article says the money will be used in ethanol and biodiesel programs for research and financing for the installation of new industrial plants . 
An agreement between [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Japan  ] will be signed in October and the investment funds will start flowing as early as March 2007 the article reports . 
[PER Ricardo Dornelles  ] , director of the [ORG Department of Renewable Energy  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Ministry of Mines and Energy  ] , is quoted as saying that countries are looking for alternatives to petroleum and that [LOC Brazil  ] is confronting the challenge of creating a market for ethanol and biodiesel. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
Post will pass [LOC Brazil  ] 's non paper on bilateral cooperation on research on biofuels/ethanol when received .
