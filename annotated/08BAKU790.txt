( C ) SUMMARY: On August 19 , President [PER Aliyev  ] told visiting [ORG British Petroleum  ] CEO [PER Inglis  ] that [LOC Azerbaijan  ] is taking quiet steps to support [LOC Georgia  ] , although [PER Aliyev  ] himself did not publicly support the [MISC Georgian  ] President . 
For example , [MISC Azerbaijanis  ] are repairing a critical rail bridge destroyed by the [MISC Russians  ] . 
[PER Aliyev  ] reconfirmed his western orientation for oil and gas exports , although he acknowledged that he would sell some gas to [LOC Russia  ] and oil to [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Aliyev  ] stressed that gas sales to [LOC Russia  ] would be limited , maybe 2 bcm , and that the purpose would be to pressure [LOC Turkey  ] to conclude gas transit talks ; oil sales to [LOC Iran  ] are a result of current pipeline constraints . 
[PER Aliyev  ] said that during the crisis he phoned [LOC Moscow  ] to warn them against attacking [MISC Azeri  ] interests in [LOC Georgia  ] , including pipelines , the ethnic [MISC Azeri  ] community and the [MISC Azeri-owned  ] oil terminal at [LOC Kulevi  ] . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On August 20 , [ORG British Petroleum’s Chief  ] Executive Officer for Exploration and Production [PER Andrew Inglis  ] briefed the Charge on his one-hour one-on-one meeting with President [PER Ilham Aliyev  ] on the evening of August 19 . 
[PER Inglis  ] was to meet [PER Aliyev  ] on August 20 , but the President asked to see [PER Inglis  ] early before the President’s meeting with visiting [MISC Turkish  ] PM [MISC Erdogan  ] . 
[PER Inglis  ] said that the President appeared “relaxed , convivial and warm.” PRESIDENT’S REACTION TO [LOC GEORGIA  ] CRISIS -------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The President told [PER Inglis  ] , “I didn’t rush to stand behind [PER Saakashvili  ] because it would have made no difference.” The President quickly added that [LOC Azerbaijan  ] is quietly finding ways to support [LOC Georgia  ] . 
He claimed that [LOC Azerbaijan  ] is providing more aid than anyone by using its people within the country ( Comment: a possible reference to ethnic [MISC Azeri  ] [MISC Georgians  ] ) to do “real things.” For example , he reported that [MISC Azerbaijanis  ] are repairing the destroyed rail bridge link. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Aliyev  ] emphasized that the events of the past few days “reinforce the journey ( towards a western orientation ) and not the need for a [MISC U-turn.”  ] He said that he is not in favor of changing his foreign policy in response to this conflict . 
His foreign policy has been to develop Azerbaijan’s independence from [LOC Russia  ] using its oil and gas resources . 
This engagement continues. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The President did probe [PER Inglis  ] about the timing of the [LOC Georgia  ] invasion in relation to the [ORG PKK  ] attack on the [MISC Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan  ] ( [ORG BTC  ] ) pipeline . 
He did not explicitly endorse the following conspiracy theory , but was interested in [LOC Inglis’  ] reaction . 
[PER Aliyev  ] linked the following events: -- The [ORG PKK  ] , formerly sponsored by the [ORG KGB  ] , attacks the [ORG BTC  ] . 
-- Three days later [LOC Russia  ] invades [LOC Georgia  ] . 
-- In a seemingly random act , the [MISC Russians  ] blows up a key railway bridge halting rail export of oil . 
-- A stray bomb falls 10 meters from the [LOC Baku-Supsa  ] oil pipeline . 
-- Transneft reports a technical fault along the [ORG Novorossiysk Line  ] threatening one of the last remaining oil export route . 
PRESIDENT [PER ALIYEV  ] PHONES [LOC MOSCOW  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) President [PER Aliyev  ] noted that when he learned that a stray [MISC Russian  ] bomb struck near the [LOC Baku-Supsa  ] line , he rang [LOC Moscow  ] ( he inferred that he called [PER Putin  ] but did not specify ) . 
He said that he wanted to make clear that it would be considered a “major act” if [LOC Russia  ] took actions against Azerbaijan’s interests . 
He specifically complained about the bombing of a military airfield in the ethnic [MISC Azeri  ] community of [LOC Marneuli  ] , the stray bomb near the [LOC Baku-Supsa  ] pipeline and reports of [MISC Russian  ] troops entering the [MISC Azeri-owned  ] oil terminal at [LOC Kulevi  ] . 
[PER Aliyev  ] said that in response , the troops withdrew from [LOC Kulevi  ] and there were no further bombings in these sensitive areas . 
[LOC BAKU  ] 00000790 002 OF 003 GAS SALES TO [LOC RUSSIA  ] A “SUBTERFUGE” ---------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Inglis  ] explained that limited future gas sales to [LOC Russia  ] are for the purposes of enhancing Azerbaijan’s position in the gas transit talks with [LOC Turkey  ] . 
He emphasized that [PER Aliyev  ] told him that [LOC Azerbaijan  ] still wants to sell [MISC Shah Deniz Phase Two  ] gas west and not north. “It would be madness to do otherwise . 
The events have not changed the ( political ) rationale for exporting gas westward , ” the President added. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Inglis  ] believes that [PER Aliyev  ] is in a much stronger position with [LOC Turkey  ] than a month ago . 
[PER Inglis  ] added that [LOC Turkey  ] must agree to transit rights and that [PER Aliyev  ] is not going to negotiate from a point of weakness . 
[PER Aliyev  ] said that he would be selling some gas to [LOC Russia  ] and that “these sales to [LOC Russia  ] must be credible.” [PER Inglis  ] noted that , for [LOC Russia  ] , some is not enough . 
There is not enough gas to go around and [LOC Russia  ] wants it all . 
There’s no compromise solution . 
The 2 bcm to [LOC Russia  ] is not significant . 
It is “subterfuge” for the price negotiations , [PER Inglis  ] added. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The President also told [PER Inglis  ] that as a result of the pipeline closures , [LOC Azerbaijan  ] will be forced to sell crude to [LOC Iran  ] . 
ADDITIONAL DETAILS ABOUT THE [ORG PKK  ] ATTACK ON [ORG BTC  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Inglis  ] confirmed reftel report that [ORG BP  ] has evidence showing that the fire at the block valve along [ORG BTC  ] in [LOC Turkey  ] was the result of sabotage. “We are absolutely confident it was terrorism , ” he said . 
The evidence are photos showing a dent in the 8 inch bypass pressure line showing force from the outside as well as shrapnel holes . 
He passed copies of these photos to President [PER Aliyev  ] to show [MISC Turkish  ] PM [MISC Erdogan  ] in the event [MISC Erdogan  ] denied that this was caused by terrorists. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Inglis  ] added that the block valves are the most vulnerable points , while the 42 inch main line is buried and was not damaged . 
To attack the main line would require a two meter trench , and something to penetrate its thick alloy . 
There are ten most vulnerable block valves in [LOC Turkey  ] . 
[ORG BP  ] has asked that the [MISC Turkish  ] security forces “camp out” at these valve stations , in addition to requesting that the [ORG Turkish State Oil Company  ] Botas eventually harden the facilities around the valves . 
[ORG BP  ] has raised this with the [ORG Ministry of Energy  ] in [LOC Turkey  ] , but believes it needs to be raised with the [MISC Turkish  ] Army as well. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) In [LOC Turkey  ] , block valves are housed in “little green corrugated shacks , ” whereas in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] the block valves and actuators are in concrete buildings with intrusion detectors . 
In [LOC Borjomi  ] , [LOC Georgia  ] , [ORG BP  ] has installed carbon fiber matting to defend the main line against an RPG attack and fiber optic lines above the main line to detect digging . 
[MISC AZERI  ] CHARM OFFENSIVE WITH [ORG BP  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Last year , the [ORG Azerbaijani State Oil Company  ] ( [ORG SOCAR  ] ) was threatening to have [ORG BP  ] Azerbaijan’s President arrested and tried for theft of state resources . 
In contrast , [PER Inglis  ] described the mood about [ORG BP  ] in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] as having come full circle . 
[PER Aliyev  ] made positive comments to the press about [ORG BP  ] and [ORG SOCAR  ] being friends in difficult times. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The President told [PER Inglis  ] that [LOC Azerbaijan  ] still needs [ORG BP  ] . 
He asked rhetorically , “If [ORG SOCAR  ] owned [ORG BTC  ] would it still be there ? ” The President said he knows that he needs to keep [ORG BP  ] motivated and interested in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] . 
There was good discussion about a [MISC Production Sharing Agreement  ] ( [ORG PSA  ] ) extension and the extraction of [MISC Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli  ] ( ACG ) deep gas . 
[PER Inglis  ] believed the details will still move at a certain pace , for tactical reasons , but that these issues are headed in the right direction. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) The President summoned the [ORG SOCAR  ] President after the evening meeting with [PER Inglis  ] and made [ORG SOCAR  ] available to [PER Inglis  ] the next day. “ ( [ORG SOCAR  ] President ) Rovnag ( [PER Abdullayev  ] ) was the nicest [MISC Rovnaq  ] we’ve ever met.” [PER Inglis  ] said that he [LOC BAKU  ] 00000790 003 OF 003 had “real conversation” with [PER Abdullayev  ] about the [MISC Shah Deniz Phase One  ] gas price . 
[PER Inglis  ] advised [ORG SOCAR  ] to settle on a price now and not wait for a conclusion of transit talks as the price of gas is rising every day . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER Inglis  ] believes that [PER Aliyev  ] is looking for a statement from the [LOC West  ] ( and particularly the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) that parallels Aliyev’s statement to [MISC Moscow: If  ] you mess with the pipelines , you’re messing with us . 
He noted that [PER Aliyev  ] was dismissive of high-level people turning up in [LOC Baku  ] for a photo-op with him and lacking a substantive message. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) On the sale of [MISC Azeri  ] gas to [LOC Russia  ] , [PER Inglis  ] clearly seemed to be spinning this to try to head off expected [LOC U.S.  ] objection to such a sale . 
His analysis may yet be true about this sale being used to pressure [LOC Turkey  ] over transit talks , but it is also doubtless motivated by BP’s commercial interest in developing a market and routes to justify [MISC Shah Deniz Phase Two  ] and ACG deep gas production . 
Likewise , [LOC Azerbaijan  ] oil sales to [LOC Iran  ] could be problematic , if continued over the longer-term .
