REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: The [PER Pope  ] 's decision to reinstate communion with a breakaway [MISC Catholic  ] group that included a Holocaust-denying cleric ( ref A ) proved that his highest concern is the long-term religious well-being of the Church , not the [LOC Holy See  ] 's relations with other sovereign states . 
This religion-first attitude is also informing the [LOC Holy See  ] 's planning for the [PER Pope  ] 's probable trip to [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Jordan  ] next May ( ref B ) and its handling of a controversy over whether [MISC WWII  ] [PER Pope Pius XII  ] should be declared a saint . 
Most [LOC Holy See  ] insiders believe that this is the right approach for a 2,000 year-old institution which considers its greatest historical failure " the scandal of the [MISC Christian  ] disunity . 
" This said , [PER Pope Benedict XVI  ] -- himself a [MISC German  ] who lived through [MISC WWII  ] -- has publicly deplored anti-Semitism and emphasized improved relations with the [MISC Jews  ] . 
The [LOC Holy See  ] may find , however , that its politically tone-deaf handling of this decision may cool the [PER Pope  ] 's reception in [LOC Israel  ] this May , if the trip is confirmed ) . 
End Summary Broad Context , [ORG Long History  ] for [ORG Vatican-Jewish Dialogue  ] --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a lengthy discussion with [ORG CDA  ] and A/DCM on January 23 , the Secretary of the [LOC Holy See  ] 's [ORG Commission for Relations  ] with the [MISC Jews  ] , [PER Father Norbert Hofmann  ] , described [MISC Vatican-Jewish  ] dialogue efforts . 
He noted that an odd organizational decision demonstrates just how important [MISC Catholic-Jewish  ] relations are to the [ORG Vatican:  ] the [ORG Commission for Relations  ] with [MISC Jews  ] comes under the [ORG Pontifical Council  ] for the Promotion of [MISC Christian  ] Unity -- not/not the [ORG Pontifical Council  ] on [ORG Inter-Religious Dialogue  ] ( which deals with relations with [MISC Muslims  ] , [MISC Hindus  ] , [MISC Buddhists  ] and [MISC Animists  ] ) . 
According to [PER Hofmann  ] , [MISC Jewish  ] leaders appreciate this arrangement because it is to their advantage to underline the special relationship that bounds Christianity to [ORG Judaism.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Both religions accord major importance to dialogue . 
Since the Second [ORG Vatican Council  ] ( 1962-1965 ) , the [MISC Catholic  ] Church has pursued closer ties with [MISC Judaism  ] , citing their shared texts and history . 
In recent years , and coinciding with the election of [MISC German  ] [PER Pope Benedict XVI  ] ( who lived through [MISC WWII  ] as a child ) , the effort to strengthen these ties has been kicked into high gear . 
[MISC Jews  ] , [PER Hofmann  ] said , think good relations with the [LOC Holy See  ] help combat anti-Semitism and ensure that there will never be another [LOC Shoa  ] . 
Denial of Outrage about Perceived Affronts ------------------------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Hofmann  ] opined that [PER Pope Benedict XVI  ] 's reinstatement of the four [ORG Lefebvrist  ] clerics excommunicated by [PER Pope John Paul II  ] ( ref a ) would not damage [LOC Vatican  ] relations with the [MISC Jews  ] over the long term . 
He anticipated that the public denial of the Holocaust by one of the four , [PER Bishop Williamson  ] , would be controversial and would attract criticism in the short term but then be set aside quickly . 
Other Church leaders seemed to agree that since the [PER Pope  ] 's decision was religious , not political , it would be understood as such . 
The head of the [MISC French  ] bishops' conference , for example , hailed the act as " a gesture of mercy and openness for strengthening Church unity . 
" Other Church leaders disassociated themselves from [PER Bishop Williamson  ] 's Holocaust denials , then adding words of welcome for the reinstatement of the four [ORG Lefebvrists  ] . 
It fell mostly to [PER Cardinal Kasper  ] , who runs the [MISC Catholic-Jewish  ] dialogue , to condemn the rehabilitated bishop 's remarks as " stupid " and " unacceptable , " and having " nothing to do with the [MISC Catholic  ] Church . 
" As is typical , the [PER Pope  ] stayed above the fray and did not comment. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Indeed , most Church leaders seem to think the damage from this matter will not last or harm the [PER Pope  ] 's planned visit to [LOC Israel  ] . 
[PER Father Hofmann  ] specifically said the controversy would join other similar matters as " non-issues in the good state of [MISC Jewish-Catholic  ] relations . 
" Nevertheless , other controversies continue to rankle with [MISC Jews  ] and others . 
Among them is an old [MISC Latin Catholic  ] Mass prayer calling for conversion of [MISC Jews  ] . 
Even more controversial in recent months has been the proposal to canonize ( make a saint of ) [PER Pope Pius XII  ] , the [MISC WWII-era  ] [PER Pope  ] who some criticize for not having publicly denounced the Holocaust . 
Rabbi Cohen of [LOC Haifa  ] ( [LOC Israel  ] ) , the first Rabbi ever invited to address a [ORG Synod of bishops  ] , implicitly criticized the canonization proposal in his remarks to the bishops last fall . 
Church officials did not expect the criticism and were annoyed by it . 
[PER Hofmann  ] dismissed even those public remarks , though , saying the Rabbi had confided in him that he 'd been pressured by other [MISC Jewish  ] leaders to deliver the point . 
[LOC VATICAN  ] 00000011 002.2 OF 002 Prospects for [PER Pope  ] 's Trip to [LOC Israel  ] and [LOC Jordan  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Meanwhile , the [PER Pope  ] 's planned visit to [LOC Israel  ] looms large in [MISC Vatican-Jewish  ] relations . 
Consistent with what other [LOC Vatican  ] officials have told us ( ref b ) , [PER Father Hofmann  ] confirmed that the [PER Pope  ] 's trip was not conditioned on resolving Church property taxation issues in the [LOC Israel-Holy See Fundamental Agreement  ] . 
The real motivation for the trip is , again , religious: the eighty-one year-old [PER Pope  ] wants to make a pilgrimage to the [ORG Holy Land  ] as Pontiff before his advanced age makes it too difficult . 
At the same time , the [LOC Holy See  ] believes the [PER Pope  ] 's trip to [LOC Israel  ] , the [ORG West Bank  ] and [LOC Jordan  ] will advance awareness about the Holocaust and the need to combat anti-Semitism . 
A Papal visit will also publicly highlight the [LOC Vatican  ] 's acceptance of the [ORG State of Israel  ] , with which the [LOC Holy See  ] established relations in 1993 . 
[PER Hofmann  ] implied that for these reasons , absent major negative developments , the trip would occur. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) In a separate conversation on January 23 , the new [MISC Israeli  ] Ambassador to the [LOC Holy See  ] , [PER Mordechai Lewy  ] , took a somewhat more jaded view . 
While confirming that planning without pre-conditions is underway , expressing hope that the trip would happen , and acknowledging that it could advance [MISC Catholic-Jewish  ] dialogue , [PER Lewy  ] would not speculate on its likelihood . 
[PER Lewy  ] did not see many prospects for a Papal visit helping to resolve the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] conflict . 
While [LOC Israel  ] wants to keep on good terms with the [LOC Holy See  ] to avoid problems , he said , [MISC Israeli  ] leaders don't think that the [LOC Vatican  ] can influence the [MISC Arabs.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) On the other hand , [PER Lewy  ] said , the [MISC Jordanians  ] may have a pecuniary interest in the visit . 
[PER Prince Ghazi  ] , [PER Lewy  ] alleged , has financial stakes in the possible tourist development of the area around Jesus' baptismal site . 
A Papal visit to this area would be good for business . 
Since not all churches in that area would welcome such development , this has caused some conflict between authorities and local churches. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [MISC Israeli  ] Ambassador did not think that the recent [LOC Gaza  ] crisis would play a role in the [PER Pope  ] 's final decision on whether to travel to the [ORG Holy Land  ] . 
[PER Lewy  ] was disappointed with the [LOC Vatican  ] 's criticism of [MISC Israeli  ] actions in [LOC Gaza  ] , and raised his views with [PER Monsignor Parolin  ] , the [LOC Holy See  ] 's deputy foreign minister . 
[PER Lewy  ] urged [PER Parolin  ] to say something positive about [LOC Israel  ] to balance these remarks . 
Specifically , he wanted the [LOC Holy See  ] to state publicly that the religious freedom [MISC Christians  ] enjoy in [LOC Israel  ] is unparalleled in the [LOC Middle East  ] , where [MISC Christian  ] minorities are increasingly on the defensive against political [MISC Islam  ] . 
[PER Parolin  ] , he said , committed to do so . 
( C ) Comment: A Formidable Partner in Need of [MISC P.R. Lessons  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Pope Benedict  ] sometimes bewilders politicians and journalists by pursuing what he believes is in the best interest of the Church , such as reinstating the [ORG Lefebvrists  ] or considering the canonization of [PER Pius XII  ] . 
( His predecessor , [PER John Paul II  ] , suffered from some of the same second-guessing . 
) [LOC Vatican  ] outsiders lament decisions or policies that they perceive as being out-of-step with the new millennium , and call for the Church to be more modern and accommodating . 
What these observers fail to recognize is the consistency of the [LOC Holy See  ] 's decisions and behavior on key issues like the reunification of the Church or the dignity of all human beings - and the value of that consistency . 
Regardless of whether outsiders agree or disagree with the [LOC Holy See  ] , it 's hard to dispute its moral influence , geographic reach , and ability to grab headlines . 
These qualities can make the [LOC Vatican  ] a formidable partner for the [LOC U.S.  ] and other nations in the pursuit of common objectives. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) At the same time , there 's no denying the fact that a little more attention to how the outside world views decisions taken inside the [MISC Church  ] could help the [LOC Holy See  ] protect its image and further its influence . 
Although Church leaders like [PER Benedict  ] are adopting new means of communication to get their message to a wider audience ( ref C ) , they have not yet embraced fully the need -- and tools -- for 21st century public relations . 
The [LOC Holy See  ] 's spokesmen could have resoundingly denounced the [MISC Holocaust-denying  ] views of Bishop [PER Williamson  ] at the same time the [PER Pope  ] welcomed him back into the Church , but they waited days to do so , and then did it weakly . 
By then , much of the damage had been done . 
Instead of scoring a religious hat-trick -- reuniting the Church , demonstrating the Church 's commitment to second chances for those who have erred , and reaffirming the horrors of the Holocaust -- the [LOC Holy See  ] is playing catch-up .
