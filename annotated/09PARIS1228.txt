A. [LOC PARIS  ] 01205 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
[PER B. BAGHDAD  ] 02397 [ORG Classified By: Political Minister-Counselor Kathleen H. Allegrone for Reasons  ] 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) We met with [ORG Elysee  ] strategic affairs advisor [PER Richier September  ] 4 to follow up on reports that a [MISC French  ] judge had released [MISC Iranian  ] national [PER Majid Kakavand  ] on bail and subject to determination of a pending [LOC U.S.  ] extradition request . 
In previous conversations about the fate of [MISC French  ] citizen [PER Clothilde Reiss  ] and her release to [MISC French  ] embassy custody in [LOC Tehran  ] , [PER Richier  ] had assured us that [LOC France  ] had no intention to negotiate with [MISC Iranian  ] authorities on a prisoner exchange and that President [PER Sarkozy  ] himself had been apprised of and rejected an [MISC Iranian  ] effort to seek the release of [PER Kakavand  ] . 
( ref. a ) <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Responding to Pol M/C , s questions , [PER Richier  ] told us that the [ORG Elysee  ] had been taken completely by surprise by the judge 's decision . 
The prosecutor in the case had consistently argued for holding [PER Kakavand  ] , but the judge had determined that [PER Kakavand  ] " presented little chance for flight " and had agreed to release him on 200,000 euro bond . 
According to [PER Richier  ] , the [ORG Elysee  ] reacted quickly and strongly to news of the decision on August 28 and that there were very sharp exchanges between the Office of the President ( [ORG Elysee  ] ) and the Justice Minister , but that the government cannot reverse the judge , s decision . 
However , [PER Richier  ] assured us that [MISC French  ] authorities are keeping a close eye on [PER Kakavand  ] , s whereabouts to prevent or interrupt possible flight . 
They have established what [PER Richier  ] called " tight " surveillance on [PER Kakavand  ] . 
Proving the point , [PER Richier  ] telephoned to a colleague in one of the services who confirmed that [PER Kakavand  ] was currently in buildings owned by [LOC Iran  ] and managed by the [MISC Iranian  ] [ORG Embassy  ] , located in [LOC Paris  ] . 
[PER Richier  ] added his own private observation that the way in which the judgment was rendered in this case implies that the request for extradition will be approved , although we must wait until October for that decision. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Comment: The [MISC French  ] have been concerned , from the beginning of their hostage case , about possible [MISC Iranian  ] pressure to exchange [MISC Iranian  ] prisoners for [MISC French  ] or [LOC U.S.  ] nationals held in [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Embassy Baghdad  ] reporting ( ref. b ) suggests that is exactly what [LOC Iran  ] plans to do . 
Obviously the [MISC French  ] judge , s decision to grant [PER Kakavand  ] a temporary release complicates the situation . 
However , [PER Sarkozy  ] , s public tone and [PER Richier  ] , s strong comments , suggest that [LOC France  ] will make every effort to keep [PER Kakavand  ] under close surveillance , pending a decision on the extradition request .
