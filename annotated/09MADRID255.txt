OSC: EUP20090106178004 [ORG MADRID  ] 00000255 001.4 OF 002 Classified By: Charge d'Affaires [PER Arnold A. Chacon  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) SUMMARY: This cable provides an update on recent Embassy attempts to engage the [ORG GOS  ] on designation of [PER Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas  ] , aka " [PER Abu Dahdah  ] , " the convicted leader of the [ORG Al Qaeda  ] ( [ORG AQ  ] ) cell in [LOC Spain  ] . 
The issue remains unresolved , and has taken a twist following allegations beginning in April 2008 that [PER Yarkas  ] was involved in financing terrorism from his jail cell during 2006-07 . 
A three judge-panel in July 2008 suspended the prosecution of the case , which was formally closed in December 2008 . 
However , the [MISC Spanish  ] magistrate who presided over [PER Yarkas  ] 's original trial recently hinted to [ORG Embassy  ] officials that [ORG GOS  ] investigations of [PER Yarkas  ] - whether for the purposes of suspicious transactions or for broader reasons - are either ongoing or may soon be resumed . 
END SUMMARY. //Background on Yarkas// <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) As reported in [LOC REFTELS  ] , [PER Yarkas  ] has been in a [MISC Spanish  ] prison since his November 2001 arrest . 
He was convicted in 2005 and sentenced to 12 years for membership in a terrorist organization and to 15 years for conspiring to commit terrorist murder on 9/11/2001 , although in 2006 the [ORG Supreme Court  ] , citing lack of admissible evidence , overturned the latter conviction . 
Despite the [ORG Supreme Court  ] 's action , Magistrate [PER Javier Gomez Bermudez  ] , the President of the [ORG National Court 's Criminal Chamber  ] who presided over the three-judge panel that heard [PER Yarkas  ] 's trial in 2005 , reaffirmed - unsolicited - to [ORG POLOFF  ] and LEGAT during a private lunch on February 24 that [PER Yarkas  ] did meet with [PER Mohammed Atta  ] and [PER Ramzi Binalshibh  ] in 2001 as part of final preparatory meetings for the 9/11 attacks , which he asserted confirmed the links of [PER Yarkas  ] 's cell to [ORG AQ  ] and justifies the original conviction . 
More recently , there have been sporadic press reports for nearly a year on allegations that [PER Yarkas  ] was involved in financing terrorism from his jail cell during 2006-07 . 
This cable provides an update on [ORG Embassy Madrid  ] 's extensive reporting on this allegation ( See [PER REFTELS A-D  ] ) . //Efforts to Convince [ORG GOS  ] to Designate Yarkas// <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) In 2009 , [ORG Embassy Madrid  ] has attempted to re-engage the [ORG GOS  ] on the years-long [ORG USG  ] interest in having the [ORG GOS  ] designate Yarkas' assets . 
On January 15 , an adviser to the Deputy Interior Minister told [ORG POLOFF  ] " You didn't hear it from me , but the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] agrees completely that [PER Yarkas  ] should be designated . 
" The adviser suggested the [ORG Embassy  ] should approach the [ORG MFA  ] on the matter . 
[ORG POLOFF  ] and Deputy ECON Counselor broached the issue on January 26 with the [ORG MFA  ] 's Sub-Directorate General for [MISC International Terrorism Issues  ] . 
Acting Deputy Director [PER Iago Losada  ] claimed limited knowledge of the issue , but said he would look into the matter and also recommended that the [ORG Embassy  ] approach the [ORG GOS  ] 's [ORG National Center for Counterterrorism Coordination  ] ( [ORG CNCA  ] ) . 
In early February , the [ORG Embassy  ] 's Office of [ORG Regional Affairs  ] ( [ORG ORA  ] ) raised the issue with the [ORG CNCA  ] during a regularly scheduled meeting . 
The [ORG CNCA  ] official , however , was evasive and exhibited telltale body language that expressed the official 's considerable unease with the topic , quickly referring the [ORG Embassy  ] back to the [ORG MFA  ] . 
The Deputy ECON Counselor followed up with [PER Losada  ] , who confirmed our understanding of the designation process - the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] gathers the information and passes the dossier to the [ORG MFA  ] for action , including notifying the [ORG UNSC  ] and [ORG EU  ] - but was unable to state whether the [ORG MFA  ] had received the materials on [PER Yarkas  ] from the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] . 
[PER Losada  ] doubted that he would be able to find out anything more and intimated that any further information on the case should come from the [ORG CNCA  ] . 
[ORG MADRID  ] 00000255 002.4 OF 002 // Case May Not Be Closed on Allegations that [PER Yarkas Financed Terrorism  ] From [MISC Jail//  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) As indicated in REFTEL F and the February 13 edition of leading news magazine , [ORG El Tiempo de Hoy  ] , a three-judge panel -- comprised of [PER Felix Alfonso Guevara  ] , [PER Maria de los Angeles Angeles Barreiro  ] , and [PER Clara Eugenia Bayarri  ] -- in December 2008 closed the case of [PER Yarkas  ] 's involvement in financing terrorism from his jail cell , arguing that the transactions in question were merely the actions of a former [PER Yarkas  ] co-defendant , [PER Brassam Dalati  ] , breaking off all financial links to [PER Yarkas  ] . 
In closing the case , the panel accused the [MISC Spanish National Police  ] and an investigating judge of having brought forward a sloppy case and even of having trumped up the charges of terrorism finance while ignoring exculpatory evidence. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) On February 24 , [ORG POLOFF  ] and LEGAT raised the subject - among others - during lunch with Magistrate [PER Gomez Bermudez  ] , who surprised them by indicating that he was personally involved in investigations into [PER Yarkas  ] 's financial activities . 
The magistrate 's opinion was that the terrorism finance case described in Para 5 should not have been closed . 
He indicated that he believed another judge had committed judicial mistakes in his or her handling of the case , which has prompted [PER Gomez Bermudez  ] to look into the issue . 
[PER Gomez Bermudez  ] politely indicated to [ORG POLOFF  ] and LEGAT that it would be inappropriate for him to speak further about the topic , which they understood to mean that the investigation had been or may be re-opened. //What 's In Store for Yarkas// <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) [PER Gomez Bermudez  ] stated that [PER Yarkas  ] will serve his full 12-year sentence and that his time served before the verdict was announced does count towards his sentence , which means he will be released in late 2013 . 
As a convicted terrorist , he does not qualify for any work-release program or time off for good behavior . 
( [MISC COMMENT:  ] The [MISC Spanish  ] judiciary has updated its laws on this issue in part to prevent a similar situation to the 2008 release of [PER Jose Ignacio  ] " [PER Inaki  ] " de [PER Juan Chaos  ] , a high-profile and unrepentant convicted murderer from the [ORG Basque Fatherland and Liberty  ] ( [ORG ETA  ] ) terrorist group . 
[PER De Juana Chaos  ] only spent 18 years behind bars after receiving a symbolic sentence of more than 3,000 years - even though by law the most that anyone can serve is 30 years . 
END COMMENT . 
) Asked if [PER Yarkas  ] had ever expressed any remorse or regret for his actions , [PER Gomez Bermudez  ] responded that not only had [PER Yarkas  ] not done those things , but he also remains very antagonistic to prison guards and [ORG GOS  ] officials , speaking to them in a very vicious way . 
The magistrate further remarked that , as a naturalized [MISC Spanish  ] citizen , [PER Yarkas  ] will not be deported after completing his sentence and will be free to live in [LOC Spain  ] if he so chooses . 
If so , [PER Gomez Bermudez  ] suggested [PER Yarkas  ] would likely be monitored by [ORG GOS  ] security services .
