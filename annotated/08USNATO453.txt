( [ORG S/REL NATO  ] ) Summary . 
[ORG National Intelligence Officer  ] ( [ORG NiO  ] ) for [LOC South Asia  ] , Dr. [PER Peter Lavoy  ] , briefed [ORG NATO Permanent  ] Representatives on the [ORG National Intelligence Estimate  ] ( [ORG NIE  ] ) for [LOC Afghanistan  ] on November 25 . 
He said the [ORG NIE  ] describes a grim situation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and predicts that negative trends will continue through 2009 if five inter-dependent regional challenges in [LOC South Asia  ] are not addressed: defeating al-Qaida in [LOC Pakistan  ] , creating stability in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , creating stability in western [LOC Pakistan  ] , creating stability in [LOC Pakistan  ] as a whole particularly in the economy , and improving the bilateral [MISC India-Pakistan  ] relationship . 
Permanent Representatives called Lavoy’s report “unrelentingly gloomy , ” but appeared to agree with his assessment that [LOC Afghanistan  ] is “winnable , ” especially if [ORG NATO  ] takes several immediate concrete steps to improve the situation . 
End summary. -------------- KEY CHALLENGES -------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/REL NATO  ] ) [ORG NiO  ] [PER Lavoy  ] opened his briefing to a November 25 informal meeting of [ORG NATO Permanent  ] Representatives ( PermReps ) by saying the situation for 2009 in [LOC Afghanistan  ] looked bleak unless the international community addressed five inter-dependent regional challenges: -- Defeating al-Qaida in the [LOC Federally Administered Tribal Areas  ] ( [LOC FATA  ] ) of [LOC Pakistan  ] ; -- Creating stability in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ; -- Creating stability in [LOC Pakistan’s Northwest Frontier Province  ] , [LOC Baluchistan Province  ] , and the [ORG FATA  ] ; -- Creating stability in [LOC Pakistan  ] as a whole , with particular emphasis on [MISC Pakistan’s  ] economy ; and -- Improving the bilateral [MISC India-Pakistan  ] relationship. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/REL NATO  ] ) [PER Lavoy  ] described [ORG FATA  ] as the command and control center for al-Qaida worldwide , and said a few hundred senior and mid-level trainers , planners , and operators reside there . 
Despite al-Qaida’s presence in the [LOC FATA  ] , he continued , it plays a surprisingly insignificant role in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , where the numbers of foreign fighters remain relatively low . 
Al-Qaida is more disrupted than at any time since October 2001 , but the organization is damaged , not broken . 
The international community cannot afford to let pressure off al-Qaida , because it has demonstrated an ability to reconstitute itself in the past , and could easily reverse-migrate back to [LOC Afghanistan  ] if the [ORG Taliban  ] were to regain control . 
[PER Lavoy  ] emphasized that the consequences of failing in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and permitting al-Qaida to shift its center of gravity to [LOC Afghanistan  ] would pose a threat to all nations inside their own borders. ---------------------- SOURCES OF INSTABILITY ---------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/REL NATO  ] ) Turning to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Lavoy  ] underlined that there are more significant factors than al-Qaida that contribute to the bleak security situation . 
The [MISC Afghan  ] government has failed to consistently deliver services in rural areas . 
This has created a void that the [ORG Taliban  ] and other insurgent groups have begun to fill in the southern , eastern , and some western provinces . 
The [ORG Taliban  ] is mediating local disputes in some areas , for example , offering the population at least an elementary level of access to justice . 
Provincial governors appointed due to close ties to [PER Karzai  ] have proven ineffective , often putting certain tribes or sub-tribes at unnatural disadvantage while promoting others . 
The [ORG Taliban  ] have effectively manipulated the grievances of disgruntled , disenfranchised tribes to win over anti-government recruits . 
Responding to a question , [PER Lavoy  ] said [PER Karzai  ] reflects the tribal fragmentation of [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
If there could be more balance of resources at the district level instead of channeling all money and efforts through [PER Karzai  ] , we could have greater success improving government linkages to the population. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/REL NATO  ] ) The [ORG Taliban  ] has become more militarily effective and is demonstrating more sophisticated infantry , communications , and command and control techniques . 
Their marksmanship is more precise , and their explosives more lethal than in previous years . 
For these reasons , [PER Lavoy  ] noted , violent attacks initiated by insurgents rose 40 percent over the past year , matching a three-year trend for drastic annual increases in insurgent attacks . 
[MISC Norwegian  ] and [MISC Turkish  ] PermReps asked about the source of expertise and financing that is allowing the [ORG Taliban  ] to become militarily proficient , especially if the number of al-Qaida senior and mid-level personnel is low . 
[PER Lavoy  ] responded that the opium economy is the number one domestic funding source for [MISC Pakistan-oriented  ] and [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Taliban  ] organizations . 
He added that insurgents have proven themselves highly adaptable , and many fighters’ veteran status has contributed to opposing forces’ improved abilities. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/REL NATO  ] ) [PER Lavoy  ] pointed to the growing professionalism and performance of the [ORG Afghan National Army  ] ( [ORG ANA  ] ) as a good news story , but noted that [ORG ISAF  ] has a 40 percent deficiency in numbers of trainers needed to constitute a projected [MISC Afghan  ] Army force strength of 134,000 troops . 
There is a similar training deficiency for [ORG Afghan National Police  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) development , he said . 
Police are seen in many provinces as a predatory force plagued by systemic problems beyond lack of professionalism , equipment , and training . 
Extortion of bribes from the populace remains common practice , often to supplement provincial government coffers . 
While there are cases where police are doing better , the [ORG ANP  ] needs more resources. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/REL NATO  ] ) Even if the international community rectifies training gaps in [MISC Afghan  ] army and police development , [PER Lavoy  ] concluded , efforts would be insufficient if [LOC Pakistan  ] remains a safe haven for insurgents . 
Similarly , solving the safe haven in [LOC Pakistan  ] is necessary but insufficient to “win” in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , without simultaneously addressing the severe governance , development , and access to justice gaps. ------------------------------- [MISC PAKISTAN’S  ] PRECARIOUS SITUATION ------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/REL NATO  ] ) [PER Lavoy  ] commented on two causes of instability in western [LOC Pakistan  ] that could cause [LOC Pakistan  ] to completely lose control of its [MISC Pashtun  ] territories over the next few years . 
Traditional [MISC Pashtun  ] tribal authority has broken down since the anti-Soviet jihad period , and is no longer capable of resolving social harmony at the community level . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] has also promulgated a policy of neglect of [MISC Pashtun  ] areas and still lacks a strategy to deal holistically with social problems of illiteracy , unemployment , and disaffected youth . 
Both of these situations play to the advantage of insurgent and extremist groups. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/REL NATO  ] ) Although [LOC Pakistan  ] now identifies both al-Qaida and the [ORG Taliban  ] as existential threats , [PER Lavoy  ] said , [MISC Pakistani  ] government institutions still support the [ORG Taliban  ] in two key ways . 
They permit the [ORG Quetta Taliban Shura  ] ( the [ORG Taliban  ] leadership council ) to operate unfettered in [LOC Baluchistan  ] province . 
[ORG Inter-Services Intelligence  ] ( [ORG ISI  ] ) provides intelligence and financial support to insurgent groups - especially the [PER Jalaluddin Haqqani  ] network out of [PER Miram Shah  ] , [LOC North Waziristan  ] - to conduct attacks in [LOC Afghanistan  ] against [MISC Afghan  ] government , [ORG ISAF  ] , and [MISC Indian  ] targets . 
PermReps questioned the rationality of [MISC Pakistan’s  ] support for the [ORG Taliban  ] , which [PER Lavoy  ] explained in three ways . 
First , [LOC Pakistan  ] believes the [ORG Taliban  ] will prevail in the long term , at least in the [MISC Pashtun  ] belt most proximate to the [MISC Pakistani  ] border . 
Second , [LOC Pakistan  ] continues to define [LOC India  ] as its number one threat , and insists that [LOC India  ] plays an over-active role in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Finally , [MISC Pakistani  ] officials think that if militant groups were not attacking in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , they would seek out [MISC Pakistani  ] targets. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/REL NATO  ] ) [PER Lavoy  ] said that after the storming of [PER Lal Masjid  ] ( [ORG Red Mosque  ] ) in July 2007 , the [MISC Pakistani  ] government had tried to sever ties with insurgent groups that its government institutions had cultivated over three decades . 
When militants sought al-Qaida support and launched a wave of attacks against [MISC Pakistani  ] government and security personnel , [LOC Pakistan  ] realized it had lost control of these insurgent groups . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] rapidly approached the various militant groups to reach domestic non-aggression deals . 
[PER Lavoy  ] claimed that the [MISC Pakistani  ] Army’s current operations in the [ORG FATA’s Bajaur Agency  ] are directed exclusively against insurgent groups that refused to cooperate , while the [PER Haqqani  ] network remains untouched and continues a policy of cross-border attacks . 
Urging militant groups to be outwardly focused , he said , is perceived by [MISC Pakistani  ] officials as a method to safeguard internal security . 
In addition , [LOC Pakistan  ] has ( probably correctly ) assessed that it is only capable of targeting several groups at a time , which leads to a policy of appeasement of other groups in the meantime. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/REL NATO  ] ) Ongoing [MISC Pakistani  ] Army operations in [ORG Bajaur Agency  ] are missing a counterinsurgency strategy to assist the population post-conflict , [PER Lavoy  ] said . 
The army requires the population to flee , fights the remaining insurgents , then uses air power to raze all structures associated with militants ( tunnels , homes , infrastructure , etc . 
) . 
The most urgent need for humanitarian international assistance to [LOC Pakistan  ] is in [LOC Bajaur  ] , where up to 300,000 residents have been displaced . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] needs to be able to repatriate these citizens and effectively rebuild in the wake of operations . 
It is critical , [PER Lavoy  ] said , that the [MISC Pakistani  ] Army succeed in [ORG Bajaur Agency  ] . 
There is a rapidly changing perception in [MISC Pakistan’s  ] military that coordination with [ORG ISAF  ] is critically important. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/REL NATO  ] ) Amidst the problems on the frontier , the [MISC Pakistani  ] economy is in tatters , [PER Lavoy  ] continued . 
The [ORG International Monetary Fund’s  ] pledge of USD 6.7 billion will only address the immediate balance of payments crisis , but will not alleviate under- or un-employment for over a third of the population [MISC Pakistan’s  ] population is becoming less and les educated , the country lacks sufficient energy and clean water resources to serve its population , an there is minimal foreign investment . 
[PER Lavoy  ] addd that despite pending economic catastrophe , [MISC Pakstan  ] is producing nuclear weapons at a faster rae than any other country in the world. ---------- IRAN’S ROLE ----------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/REL NATO  ] ) [PER Lavoy  ] responded to PermReps’ questions about [LOC Iran  ] during the discussion . 
He said [LOC Iran  ] calibrates its posture in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
It provides welcome development and social services assistance in western provinces and generally acknowledges the [ORG Taliban  ] as a long-term threat . 
However , it also provides some lethal support to the [ORG Taliban  ] , hedging bets that the [ORG Taliban  ] might prevail. ------------------------ POSITIVE POLITICAL SIGNS ------------------------ <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S/REL NATO  ] ) Moving to a more optimistic topic , [PER Lavoy  ] mentioned that political signals from [LOC India  ] may indicate a trend of toned-down rhetoric against [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
He said that although [LOC India  ] believes without doubt that [ORG ISI  ] supported the [PER Haqqani  ] network in orchestrating the [MISC Indian  ] Embassy bombing in [LOC Kabul  ] that killed over 40 people in July , [MISC Indian  ] diplomats and politicians showed restraint in public statements . 
According to [PER Lavoy  ] , political leaders also seem to realize that India’s past tactic of using military pressure to influence [MISC Pakistani  ] government to reign in militants may no longer work , especially if insurgent groups are operating against or independently of [ORG ISI  ] . 
Despite this positive political development , [PER Lavoy  ] said [LOC India  ] could do more to assuage what one [ORG PermRep  ] called “Pakistani paranoia.” The [MISC Indian  ] military continues “cold start” exercises on the [LOC Kashmir  ] border , confirming the [MISC Pakistanis’  ] worst suspicions , he added . 
[LOC India  ] would ideally move forces back from the border. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S/REL NATO  ] ) On [MISC Pakistan-Afghanistan  ] relations , [PER Lavoy  ] characterized Karzai’s relationship with [MISC Pakistani  ] President [PER Zardari  ] as trustful and allied at a political level . 
He pointed out that the [MISC Pakistani  ] Army remains deeply distrustful of the [MISC Afghan  ] president - and of [PER Zardari  ] himself . 
[PER Lavoy  ] suggested that [LOC Pakistan  ] could benefit from creating a civilian-military national security board , because politically progressive ideas on regional engagement with both [LOC India  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] have not permeated the [LOC Pakistan  ] military . 
Helping [LOC Pakistan  ] reorient its national defense policy away from [LOC India  ] and toward counterinsurgency , he said , could help refocus the [MISC Pakistani  ] military to be more successful. -------------------- PERMREPS’ DISCUSSION -------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S/REL NATO  ] ) The Secretary General ( [ORG SYG  ] ) thanked Dr. [PER Lavoy  ] for presenting the “expose” on the regional situation in [LOC South Asia  ] . 
Several PermReps noted that “the feel-good factor of the briefing was pretty low , ” and the report was “chilling” and “unrelentingly gloomy.” <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S/REL NATO  ] ) Several PermReps were interested to know how the [ORG NIE  ] affects the ongoing [ORG National Security Council  ] strategic review . 
Ambassador [PER Volker  ] responded that the [ORG NIE  ] forms a baseline analysis to inform USG officials as they formulate and evaluate policy options and recommendations for the incoming administration. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [MISC Canadian  ] [ORG PermRep  ] agreed the importance of a vastly larger and more competent [ORG ANA  ] force , and proposed that up to 200,000 troops might be necessary . 
The [MISC Belgian  ] Ambassador proposed that [ORG NATO  ] may need to prioritize [ORG ANA  ] training as ISAF’s number one priority in coming months ( Note: [LOC Belgium  ] stood in the way last week of enabling the [ORG ANA Trust Fund  ] to expand its mandate to accept national contributions to sustain [ORG ANA  ] troops . 
End note ) . 
[LOC Belgium  ] added that delegations will need help crafting messages for their capitals . 
He said that parliaments could make generating resources for a long-term commitment even more difficult if PermReps used the [ORG NIE  ] assessment to imply we have little control over many regional and systemic factors causing instability in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Pakistan.  ] <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG S/REL NATO  ] ) The [MISC Turkish  ] [ORG PermRep  ] said this briefing , while pessimistic in tone , was timed perfectly , and urged the [ORG NAC  ] to craft strong messages for the [ORG SYG  ] to deliver during an upcoming trip to [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
He commented that in the absence of effective [MISC Afghan  ] government leadership , international efforts will make little difference . 
The [MISC Polish  ] [ORG PermRep  ] said the report highlighted the renewed importance of [LOC Pakistan  ] to [ORG NATO  ] , and an urgent requirement for [ORG NATO  ] to put added pressure on [LOC Pakistan.  ] -------------------- WHAT SHOULD [ORG NATO  ] DO ? -------------------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG S/REL NATO  ] ) Ambassador [PER Volker  ] suggested three specific areas where [ORG NATO  ] could help improve the regional situation . 
He said the Alliance needed to ask itself how it can better engage at the provincial and district level ; how [ORG NATO  ] and [ORG ISAF  ] should facilitate better contact among [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] , and [LOC India  ] ; and whether it should encourage nations to commit resources to help [LOC Pakistan  ] deal with displaced people and repopulate the [ORG FATA  ] post-conflict. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG S/REL NATO  ] ) [PER Lavoy  ] endorsed these ideas , and added that despite the troubling picture in [LOC Afghanistan  ] in 2008 , [LOC Afghanistan  ] is “winnable , ” and the international community can help [LOC Pakistan  ] turn a corner . 
The formula is to enhance security , exhibit good governance emanating from [LOC Kabul  ] but active at the district level , and empower the tribes to have a stake in development at the lowest levels . 
These recommendations are logical extensions of the current strategy but require reorganization of resources . 
He concluded: -- [ORG NATO  ] should consider shifting the [ORG ISAF  ] center of gravity to the district level . 
-- The international community needs to engage tribes without arming them , and reinvigorate the traditional tribal system by instilling confidence in the population . 
Securing the people will go a long way to improve their willingness to resist the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
-- The [ORG ANA  ] needs to be stronger and is the best tool . 
It will cost more resources and require more ingenuity . 
-- Anything [ORG NATO  ] can do ( including strong messages the [ORG SYG  ] can carry to [LOC Pakistan  ] on an upcoming trip ) to encourage closer military-to-military cooperation would be helpful . 
-- Elections are a critical event and must be successful . 
September is the right time so that we have enough time to organize to secure the [MISC Pashtun  ] population. -- 2009 is the key year to influence [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Iran  ] to halt lethal assistance to the [ORG Taliban  ] by showing [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] neighbors that the [ORG Taliban  ] will not prevail . 
The international community should be relentless in pressuring [MISC Pakistanis  ] on this issue . 
-- The international community should put intense pressure on the [ORG Taliban  ] in 2009 in order to bring out their more violent and ideologically radical tendencies . 
This will alienate the population and give us an opportunity to separate the [ORG Taliban  ] from the population .
