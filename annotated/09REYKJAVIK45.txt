[PER Carol van Voorst  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: [MISC Icelandic  ] Foreign Minister [PER Skarphedinsson  ] told Ambassador on 18 February that " nothing can be ruled out " on the question of further cuts to [LOC Iceland  ] 's defense budget , and floated a trial balloon on further reductions to [LOC Iceland  ] 's contingent in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
In public comments the next day , he went even further , suggesting that the [ORG Icelandic Defense Agency  ] might be abolished entirely . 
With the Ambassador , [PER Skarphedinsson  ] was positive on the possibility of greater [MISC Nordic  ] defense cooperation as proposed in the [PER Stoltenberg  ] report , but was careful to note that this would only be a complement to [ORG NATO  ] , not a replacement . 
On [LOC Iceland  ] 's economic recovery , the [MISC FM  ] vented that the [ORG Swedish Government  ] continues to be " nit-picky " about the prerequisites for its promised bilateral loan . 
He welcomed news of [ORG USG  ] reengagement in the [LOC Durban  ] review process . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Ambassador paid a congratulatory call on new [MISC Icelandic  ] Foreign Minister [PER Ossur Skarphedinsson  ] on February 18 . 
( Note: [PER Skarphedinsson  ] has also retained his previous portfolio as Minister of Industry , Energy , and Tourism . 
) The visibly tired but impish [PER Skarphedinsson  ] opened with a readout on the [MISC Nordic  ] Foreign Ministers' meeting in [LOC Oslo  ] on 13 February , at which former [MISC Norwegian  ] Foreign and Defense Minister [PER Thorvald Stoltenberg  ] presented his report on opportunities for [MISC Nordic  ] cooperation in defense and security . 
[PER Skarphedinsson  ] , who had chaired the meeting , joked that his biggest concern had been addressing the council in " [MISC Scandinavian  ] " rather than [MISC English  ] or [MISC Icelandic.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Ambassador asked the [MISC FM  ] for his view on local press discussion on the event , noting her concern that the coverage seemed to present [MISC Nordic  ] defense cooperation as a possible replacement for [ORG NATO  ] in the [LOC High North  ] . 
[PER Skarphedinsson  ] said he had been very careful to note in his comments at the meeting and with the press that [MISC Nordic  ] cooperaton would only be a complement to [ORG NATO  ] , not a replacement . 
He opined that the [MISC Finns  ] " want into [ORG NATO  ] very badly " and as such are eager to participate in the [ORG NATO  ] air policing mission here , while [MISC Swedish  ] [PER FM Bildt  ] was much cooler to the idea . 
[PER Skarphedinsson  ] added that talk of the [MISC Nordics  ] taking over defense for [LOC Iceland  ] was in his view a rehashing of [MISC Cold War-era  ] arguments . 
The left -- including some in [PER Skarphedinsson  ] 's own party -- has seized on the [PER Stoltenberg  ] report as a chance to put forth the same old idea , but the [MISC FM  ] said he did not believe anything will come of it . 
BUDGET CUTS A POSSIBILITY ------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Turning to [MISC Icelandic  ] government funding for defense , Ambassador pressed the [MISC FM  ] on rumors that further defense cuts -- beyond the 20 percent slashed from the [ORG Icelandic Defense Agency  ] ( [ORG IDA  ] ) budget for 2009 -- are in the works . 
[PER Skarphedinsson  ] said he was taking a careful look at all options , including possibly combining some elements of the [ORG IDA  ] mission with the [ORG Icelandic Coast Guard  ] . 
" It 's all on the table , " said the [MISC FM  ] , noting that these are very hard budget times for the [ORG Icelandic Government  ] . 
Asked for her view , Ambassador described the security structure constricted after the 2006 [LOC U.S.  ] withdrawal from [LOC Keflavik  ] as a flexible , relatively cheap instrument that has served [LOC Iceland  ] and its allies well . 
She urged the [MISC FM  ] to support defense funding and pressed the [MISC FM  ] hard to counter the oft-heard notion that funding for defense is not money spent in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Every krona the [ORG IDA  ] gets for air policing purchases goods or services from [MISC Icelandic  ] vendors , and deployed forces purchase fuel and spend money at tourism venues during their off-duty hours . 
The [MISC FM  ] asked whether it made any difference whether the [ORG IDA  ] or another agency performed these functions , to which Ambassador replied that [LOC Iceland  ] and the [ORG IDA  ] have developed an excellent reputation with [ORG NATO  ] militaries that have deployed here . 
It is important to maintain those relationships and the rhythm of exercises and deployments in order to keep standards of proficiency and facilities maintenance high , she added . 
[PER Skarphedinsson  ] thanked Ambassador for her views but remained noncommittal , reiterating that the ministry is under tremendous budgetary pressure . 
He added that [LOC Iceland  ] is not the only [ORG NATO  ] Ally with such problems ; the [ORG Spanish Air Force  ] has cancelled its air policing rotation here later this year due to funding shortages. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Note: The following day , the [MISC FM  ] went even further during open debate in the [ORG Althingi  ] , suggesting that the [ORG IDA  ] might be abolished entirely and its mission parceled out to various other agencies such as the [ORG Icelandic Coast Guard  ] , [ORG Civil Aviation Authority  ] , and [ORG National Police  ] . 
The [ORG Althingi  ] 's Foreign Affairs Committee Chair , who is from the minority government 's other , openly pacifist party , immediately voiced his agreement , leading to press speculation that the [ORG IDA  ] 's days are indeed numbered . 
End note . 
DOING EVEN LESS IN [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] ? ------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The penny-pinching theme continued in response to Ambassador 's notification of the [ORG USG  ] 's Afghanistan-Pakistan policy review ( Ref B ) . 
[PER Skarphedinsson  ] said that he and his political advisor are carefully reviewing cost-saving possibilities , including a drawdown of [LOC Iceland  ] 's personnel deployed with [ORG ISAF  ] . 
( Note: [LOC Iceland  ] currently has eight personnel at [LOC Kabul International Airport  ] , [ORG ISAF  ] HQ , and [PER PRT Meymaneh  ] . 
) This has not been broached outside the [MISC FM  ] 's Office as [PER Skarphedinsson  ] knows the relevant offices will fight for every position , but as Minister he feels a responsibility to look at every way of saving money . 
Ambassador pressed vigorously , noting that during his January visit to [LOC Iceland  ] , [ORG SACEUR  ] GEN Craddock personally vouched for the importance of every one of [LOC Iceland  ] 's billets in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[ORG SACEUR  ] traveled with then-FM Gisladottir to [LOC Kabul  ] during her visit last spring , and in so doing became quite familiar with the [MISC Icelandic  ] contingent 's work , Ambassador added . 
The work the Icelanders are doing is known and appreciated , and she urged the [MISC FM  ] to maintain the current numbers . 
ECONOMIC RECOVERY , WHALING -------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Touching briefly on [LOC Iceland  ] 's economic recovery , [PER FM Skarphedinsson  ] said that although tough times are ahead , [LOC Iceland  ] will " come out better than many people expect . 
" Fishing , clean energy , and tourism will provide a strong basis for the economy 's recovery . 
Less happily , the [MISC FM  ] noted , some of the bilateral loans included in the [ORG IMF  ] bailout package have been difficult to finalize . 
Most notably , the [MISC Swedes  ] have been very " nit-picky " on the details of [LOC Iceland  ] 's recovery plan . 
[PER Skarphedinsson  ] dismissed these concerns as reflective of [LOC Sweden  ] 's traditional view of itself as the " big brother " who knows better in the bilateral relationship . 
In contrast , [LOC Norway  ] has historically been much more supportive of [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Picking up on the tourism theme , Ambassador noted her concerns about [LOC Iceland  ] 's intent to resume and expand its commercial whaling quota ; the [MISC FM  ] said he agreed but was not in a position to change the decision himself ( ref C ) . 
In closing , [PER Skarphedinsson  ] welcomed notification of [LOC U.S.  ] reengagement in the [LOC Durban  ] review process ( ref D ) and applauded the tone that President [PER Obama  ] and Secretary [PER Clinton  ] have brought to [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The new [PER FM  ] is clearly feeling pressure from his colleagues in the government to demonstrate fiscal discipline , particularly as the minority coalition tries to make good on its pledge to directly ease the burden on [MISC Icelandic  ] households . 
[PER Skarphedinsson  ] has no built-in loyalty to the [ORG IDA  ] , and though sold on the importance of [ORG NATO  ] , he has at times been a reluctant advocate of the idea that [LOC Iceland  ] should fund its own defense . 
The lure of being able to cut nearly 10 percent from the [ORG MFA  ] 's budget may simply be too much for the mercurial [PER Skarphedinsson  ] to resist . 
With no other political backers in the current government and just over two months until elections , the [ORG IDA  ] may indeed be fighting for its life . 
Post will continue to press for a sober accounting of the operational costs of such budget slashing before any moves are made , and is quietly soliciting the interventions of other [ORG NATO  ] embassies here as reinforcements. van Voorst</pre></code>
