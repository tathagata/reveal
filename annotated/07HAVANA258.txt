HAVANA 00000258 001.3 OF 002 Classified By: COM [PER Michael E. Parmly  ] ; Reasons 1.4 ( b/d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: XXXXXXXXXXXX passed us a document March 14 that describes [PER Fidel Castro  ] 's declining health , as analyzed by a respected , XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX . 
The document concludes by saying that [PER Castro  ] has a terminal condition , and will suffer an inevitable deterioration of his faculties until he dies . 
But he is not about to die " immediately . 
" This contrasts with a flurry of news and public statements by key regime figures about [PER Castro  ] making a comeback , including his having spoken to [PER Hugo Chavez  ] on the phone while the latter was in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
We believe that a full comeback is unlikely , but that [PER Fidel Castro  ] is more of a presence behind the scenes -- and even " on stage " as a presence -- than he was a few months ago . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Media have reported increased activity on the part of [PER Fidel Castro  ] this past week: Speaking on the phone to [PER Hugo Chavez  ] during the [MISC Venezuelan  ] 's visit to [LOC Haiti  ] ; and receiving [MISC Colombian  ] author and long-time sympathizer [PER Gabriel Garcia Marquez  ] . 
Both Foreign Minister [PER Felipe Perez Roque  ] ( in [LOC Europe  ] ) and Parliamentary Speaker [PER Ricardo Alarcon  ] stated publicly that [PER Fidel Castro  ] was making a comeback and would return to the [ORG GOC  ] 's helm . 
[PER Alarcon  ] 's statement included [PER Castro  ] 's " winning reelection for president " in 2008 . 
Interim dictator [PER Raul Castro  ] has kept a low profile during the past few weeks. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] passed COM and Pol-Econ Counselor a document based on [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] interview with [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] with an excellent reputation . 
The document traces [PER Fidel Castro  ] 's critical condition from its onset last July , through the various ups and downs with his local medical staff and with the visiting [MISC Spanish  ] doctor , [PER Garcia Sabrido  ] . 
Most of this repeats what has previously been reported , with one new development: [PER Castro  ] has fired his long-time personal physician , [PER Dr. Selman  ] . 
Informal translation of this document follows in [LOC Para  ] 4. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] Statement: " The illness began in the plane from [LOC Holguin  ] to [LOC Havana  ] ( Note: after a full day of July 26 , 2006 activities . 
End note ) . 
As this was a short flight there was no doctor aboard and they had to land urgently once they knew of his bleeding . 
He was diagnosed with diverticulitis of the colon . 
This illness is characterized by diverticulae in the large intestine , generally . 
A diverticula is a protuberant sack in a segment of the intestine , not in itself necessarily dangerous . 
Waste gets trapped in them , for example . 
Nevertheless , they can cause hemorrhaging , inflammation and infection , resulting in diverticulitis . 
( Health Unit Comment: Simple diverticulitis , without perforation , hemorrhaging or infection , is treatable . 
End Comment . 
) The condition requires surgery when the diverticulae are gigantic , because they are more likely to become infected and burst . 
He had a perforation in the large intestine and needed to have a colostomy done ; which he opposed , saying that they should splice out the infected part and reattach the intestine to his colon . 
[PER Dr. Selman  ] , who was chief of the medical team , was in agreement , but the rest of the team opposed . 
But [PER Fidel Castro  ] , capriciously , did not permit the colostomy . 
With the passage of time , as the colon was infected , the operation collapsed and the reattached part separated . 
They had to operate again , but found a fistula . 
It wasn't known at that time what he had , but normally a fistula in the abdomen has the effect of blocking the digestion of food--resulting in the loss of 40 pounds . 
They began to feed him by IV serum , and they used a [MISC Korean-made  ] device to treat the fistula , which didn't have much success . 
That was when they called in the [MISC Spanish  ] doctor , the one who said that they [MISC Cuban  ] team had done what they could , but the correct treatment should have been a colostomy . 
At that point they removed [PER Selman  ] from the team , who is now working as a low-level doctor someplace else . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explains that at his ( [PER Castro  ] 's ) age HAVANA 00000258 002.3 OF 002 this illness is not curable , and will notXXXXXXXXXXXX allow him to return to leading [LOC Cuba  ] . 
He won't die immediately , but he will progressively lose his faculties and become ever more debilitated until he dies . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) This report is consistent with our reporting that [PER Fidel Castro  ] probably came close to death in July , 2006 , and then again around October . 
Since then , as we have seen in video and audio broadcasts , [PER Castro  ] has been able to engage with [PER Hugo Chavez  ] and others for limited periods of conversation and other forms of carefully controlled activity . 
He has not appeared live on TV or in any other public context during the entire period of his critical illness , which caused him to miss the September , 2006 [MISC Non-Aligned  ] summit and a large-scale celebration of his birthday and armed forces day in December , 2006. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [MISC Cubans  ] react to news about [PER Fidel Castro  ] with resignation and wild speculation . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that he thought last month 's taped call-in by [PER Castro  ] to [PER Hugo Chavez  ] 's radio show was fake and that he would die by May . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] described the [PER Castro  ] illness as having a similar effect on the public as the [PER Pope  ] 's 1998 visit: Greatly raised expectation for change , followed by disappointment and reversion to the totalitarian norm. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment: We are missing too many variables to be able to predict accurately how many more months [PER Fidel Castro  ] will live . 
Frankly , we don't believe anyone , including [PER Castro  ] himself , can state that with certainty . 
However , while he is still alive , even in a reduced capacity , his presence has a chilling and retardant effect on [MISC Cuban  ] society . 
The high expectations for change are still out there , but are mostly associated with the idea that the dictator has to die first before anything substantial will happen .
