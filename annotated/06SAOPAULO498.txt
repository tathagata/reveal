( [ORG SBU  ] ) While the [MISC Lebanese  ] [MISC Christian  ] community in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] is active in politics , the [MISC Arab  ] community in general ( [MISC Muslim  ] and [MISC Christian  ] ) lacks political clout at the national level . 
In fact , our conversations with a number of [MISC Christian  ] and [MISC Muslim  ] leaders of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] 's large [MISC Middle Eastern  ] community ( mostly [MISC Lebanese  ] and [MISC Syrian  ] ) , suggest there is neither a cohesive [MISC Christian  ] nor [MISC Muslim  ] political interest group or voting bloc in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
To the limited extent that Muslims are politically active , they tend to support the governing [ORG Workers Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) and other leftist parties . 
This reflects the diversity and divisions within both of their economically important but religiously and politically divided communities . 
GoB officials often attempt to justify some of their more controversial positions and policies on [LOC Middle East  ] matters as a response to the political demands of the [LOC Brazil  ] 's [MISC Muslim  ] community . 
However , neither the [MISC Christian  ] nor the [MISC Muslim  ] community appears to be keenly interested in the [LOC Middle East  ] political scene . 
This begs the larger question of what is driving the [MISC Brazilian  ] government 's sometimes controversial and contradictory policies in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
END SUMMARY. ----------------------------------------- CONSULATE REACHES OUT TO [MISC ARAB  ] COMMUNITY LEADERS ----------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Following up on our recent meeting with leaders of the [MISC Lebanese  ] [MISC Christian  ] community during the visit of Congressman [PER Issa  ] ( [ORG Ref A  ] ) , consulate officers met separately with three other prominent leaders of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] 's [MISC Arab  ] community: Federal Deputy [PER Ricardo Izar  ] , grandson of [LOC Lebanon  ] 's first Consul in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] ; [PER Raul Tarek Fajuri  ] , an influential [MISC Arab  ] publisher ; and [PER Said Mourad  ] , a [LOC Sao Paulo  ] state legislator who claims to be the only elected [MISC Muslim  ] official in the state of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
Although these contacts represent different sub-groups of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] 's large [MISC Arab  ] community , they share similar views of the openness of [MISC Brazilian  ] society to people from other cultures and the comfortable place [MISC Arabs  ] have in this cultural melting pot . 
( NOTE: The [MISC Lebanese  ] Consul General in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] estimates that the [MISC Arab  ] community in [LOC Brazil  ] , based mostly in this consular district , consists of some seven million [MISC Christians  ] and one million [MISC Muslims  ] . 
Both the [MISC Christian  ] and [MISC Muslim  ] communities are divided along sectarian religious lines ; the [MISC Christian  ] community includes Maronites and members of other [MISC Eastern  ] churches ; among the [MISC Muslims  ] , [MISC Sunnis  ] outnumber [MISC Shias  ] , though reliable numbers are hard to come by . 
Also , it appears that a rift has developed between these two communities since the assassination of [MISC Lebanese  ] former PM [PER Hariri  ] .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Poloff  ] and Political Assistant visited Federal Deputy [PER Ricardo Izar  ] at his campaign headquarters in an upscale neighborhood in south-central [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
[PER Izar  ] , a member of the [ORG Brazilian Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PTB  ] ) , recently gained prominence due to his chairmanship of the [ORG Chamber of Deputies' Ethics Council  ] , which has attempted to discipline Deputies implicated in the political corruption scandal . 
His views on the current domestic political situation and upcoming elections will be reported septel . 
When asked to talk about his association with the [MISC Arab  ] community on the national and state level , [PER Izar  ] grew enthusiastic . 
He said his grandfather ( " that 's his picture on the wall there " ) , had fled [LOC Lebanon  ] due to persecution by the [ORG Ottoman Turks  ] and eventually settled in [LOC Brazil  ] ; he was appointed in 1918 by [LOC Lebanon  ] 's [MISC French  ] occupiers as the country 's [LOC SAO PAULO  ] 00000498 002 OF 004 representative to [LOC Sao Paulo  ] 's growing [MISC Lebanese  ] community . 
Like our other interlocutors , [PER Izar  ] said [MISC Lebanese  ] and [MISC Syrian  ] Muslims are of more recent provenance , residing mostly in [LOC Foz  ] do [LOC Iguacu  ] ( [LOC Parana  ] state ) and on the outskirts of major cities , where they sell furniture . 
The [MISC Muslim  ] community is fragmented , he said , and not politically influential ; each mosque and beneficent society tends to represent some parochial interest , and there is little common orientation . 
[PER Izar  ] characterized one mosque in the [LOC Bras  ] neighborhood of eastern [LOC Sao Paulo  ] as radical in its political orientation. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While there are many links between the [MISC Arab  ] [MISC Christian  ] and [MISC Muslim  ] communities in [LOC Brazil  ] , they are not all that close to each other . 
By way of example , [PER Izar  ] noted that the [ORG Mount Lebanon Club  ] - " the best club in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , no , in all of [LOC Brazil  ] " - a center of [MISC Lebanese  ] community social activity , did not have a single [MISC Muslim  ] member . 
He commented in passing that the [MISC Lebanese  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] did not like to be referred to or thought of as " [MISC Arabs  ] " - there was a linguistic affinity with [MISC Arabic-speakers  ] , but not an ethnic or cultural one . 
There were of course important links between the [MISC Lebanese  ] and [MISC Syrian  ] communities , as illustrated by the highly regarded [LOC Syrio-Lebanese Hospital  ] in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , whose Board had members of both communities ( again , all were [MISC Christians  ] ) . 
There are 43 Federal Deputies of [MISC Arab  ] descent , he noted , but only one - [PER Jose Janene  ] ( [ORG Progressivist Party  ] from [LOC Parana  ] , the last remaining Member to face expulsion for his role in the public bribery scandal . 
NOTE: [PER Izar  ] expressed confidence that , despite the recent exoneration by the Plenary of numerous Deputies , [PER Janene  ] will in fact be expelled . 
End NOTE . 
) - is a [MISC Muslim  ] . 
Another , [PER Jamil Murad  ] ( [ORG Communist Party of Brazil  ] from [LOC Sao Paulo  ] ) , " is not even sure what his background is , but he 's close to the [MISC Muslim  ] community . 
" To the extent that they are active in [MISC Brazilian  ] politics , [PER Izar  ] said Muslims tend to be affiliated with President [PER Lula  ] 's [ORG Workers Party  ] ( [ORG Partido  ] dos [ORG Trabalhadores  ] - [ORG PT  ] ) or parties further to the left. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Some members of the [MISC Brazilian Lebanese  ] [MISC Christian  ] community , [PER Izar  ] said , are so completely assimilated or integrated that they retain only a vague sense of their [MISC Middle Eastern  ] heritage , and no interest in the politics of the region . 
He himself was active in the [ORG Brazil-Lebanon Parliamentary Group  ] , and had attended the 1998 inauguration of [MISC Lebanese  ] President [PER Lahoud  ] . 
[PER Izar  ] expressed disagreement with many aspects of the current government 's [LOC Middle East  ] policy , and said he had taken the Foreign Minister to task over it , but had not accomplished much. --------------------------------------------- [MISC ARAB  ] PUBLISHER DENIES PERSECUTION , DOWNPLAYS MIDEAST TIES --------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Poloff  ] and Information Officer ( IO ) recently met with publisher [PER Raul  ] [PER Tarek Fajuri  ] in the offices of [MISC CHAMS  ] magazine , a leading [MISC Arab  ] monthly based in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] with a circulation of approximately 10,000 . 
The magazine , launched by [PER Fajuri  ] 's late [MISC Lebanese  ] [MISC Christian  ] mother , caters to both the [MISC Muslim  ] and [MISC Christian  ] [MISC Arab  ] communities and reports on major political and social events . 
With a focus on institution openings and ribbon-cutting , benevolent society functions , high-profile weddings , and the visits of prominent religious and secular dignitaries from the [LOC Middle East  ] , the magazine is popular in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] 's [MISC Syrian  ] and [MISC Lebanese  ] communities. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to [PER Fajuri  ] , neither the [MISC Christian  ] nor [MISC Muslim  ] [MISC Arab  ] community finds itself the target of discrimination or persecution in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
He noted that the general openness of [MISC Brazilian  ] society results in acceptance of ethnic [MISC Arabs  ] of any religion . 
[PER Fajuri  ] pointed out that [MISC Arab  ] immigrants , particularly [MISC Lebanese  ] and [MISC Syrian  ] [MISC Christians  ] from the post-World War I immigration wave , have been highly successful in [MISC Brazilian  ] business and society ( see Ref B for a broader discussion of [MISC Arab  ] immigration to [LOC Brazil  ] ) . 
Furthermore , widespread intermarriage has softened the lines between [MISC Syrian  ] and [MISC Lebanese  ] , [MISC Muslim  ] and [MISC Christian  ] . 
However , [PER Fajuri  ] observed that new arrivals are far more likely to retain ethnic and social ties to the [PER Levant  ] and the rest of the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
He also said social [LOC SAO PAULO  ] 00000498 003 OF 004 divisions among members of the various churches of [MISC Eastern Christianity  ] have all but disappeared in [LOC Brazil.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Fajuri  ] stated that [MISC Arab-Brazilians  ] who have been in [LOC Brazil  ] for a few generations have little in common , except religion , with their ancestral homeland . 
They remain largely uninterested in political activity here in [LOC Brazil  ] or in political developments in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
( NOTE: [PER Fajuri  ] 's opinion differs from that expressed in Ref A by leaders of the [MISC Brazilian Lebanese  ] [MISC Christian  ] community , who said that although [MISC Lebanese  ] nationals resident in [LOC Brazil  ] are not eligible to vote in [MISC Lebanese  ] elections , they are very interested in developments in the [PER Levant  ] , as well as [MISC Brazilian  ] policy toward the region , particularly since the assassination of former PM [PER Hariri  ] . 
END NOTE . 
) [PER Fajuri  ] averred that newer immigrants , particularly Muslims , are much more likely to travel back frequently to their homeland , to own land and have family ties there , and to follow more closely political developments in their countries of birth. ------------------------------------------ [MISC MUSLIM  ] POLITICIAN ECHOES VIEWS BUT EVINCES PARANOIA ------------------------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Poloffs  ] and Political Assistant also met recently with [PER Said Mourad  ] , the only [MISC Muslim  ] elected official in the [LOC Sao Paulo  ] state legislature . 
Ironically ( and reflecting the irrelevance of party or religious labels in [LOC Brazil  ] ) , [PER Mourad  ] is one of two representatives of the [ORG Social Christian Party  ] ( [ORG PSC  ] ) in the [LOC Sao Paulo State Legislative Assembly  ] . 
[PER Mourad  ] won office in 2002 under the banner of the [ORG rightist Party  ] for the Re-edification of the [ORG National Order  ] ( [ORG PRONA  ] ) , but subsequently switched to the [ORG Liberal Front Party  ] ( [ORG PFL  ] ) and from there to the [ORG PSC  ] . 
( COMMENT: Three parties in less than four years is a bit extreme , but party-hopping is not uncommon in [LOC Brazil  ] , where political parties often lack a clear identity and ideology . 
For example , according to his [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] official biography , Deputy [PER Izar  ] , during his 43-year career , has been affiliated with nine different political parties , including two different stints ( 1963-66 , 1989-93 ) with the [ORG Liberal Party  ] . 
END COMMENT . 
) <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Having served as state deputy for almost four years , [PER Mourad  ] claims to be the only elected [MISC Muslim  ] in state politics , and refers to himself as the informal leader of the " [ORG Peace Group  ] , " comprised of himself and eleven politicians of [MISC Arab  ] ( and [MISC Christian  ] ) descent . 
While [PER Mourad  ] does not appear to be an " up and coming " young politician on the state scene ( and appears unlikely to win his re-election bid ) , he illustrates the lack of political clout of the [MISC Arab  ] community or the existence of a solid voting bloc among [MISC Brazilian  ] Muslims . 
[PER Mourad  ] stated that he represents the [MISC Muslim  ] community but does not articulate any specifically pro-Muslim agenda <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Mourad  ] echoed [PER Fajuri  ] 's remarks about the openness of [MISC Brazilian  ] society and the general lack of prejudice experienced by members of the [MISC Arab  ] community . 
He stated emphatically that Muslims do not feel harassed in [LOC Brazil  ] , nor are they prevented , by government or society , from freely practicing their faith . 
At the same time , he voiced some of the paranoia that is occasionally expressed among [MISC Brazilian  ] Muslims regarding closer government scrutiny of [MISC Arab  ] activities ( particularly in the Tri-border area shared by [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Argentina  ] and [LOC Paraguay  ] ) . 
For instance , he claimed that " intelligence and security groups , " including the [ORG Mossad  ] , watched and followed him and harassed his family . 
[PER Mourad  ] also complained about what he considers the negative and distorted representation of the [MISC Arab  ] world in the [MISC Brazilian  ] media . 
He claimed that the press portrays [MISC Arabs  ] as " terrorists . 
" Seeking to counter this alleged bias , [PER Mourad  ] said he escorts groups , including fellow [ORG State Deputies  ] , to religious services at local mosques and to other [MISC Islamic  ] events. ------------------------------------- COMMENT: DUBIOUS GOB CLAIMS OF [MISC MUSLIM  ] VOTING BLOC ------------------------------------- [LOC SAO PAULO  ] 00000498 004 OF 004 <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) GoB officials often attempt to justify some of their more controversial positions and policies on [LOC Middle East  ] matters as a response to the political demands of the [MISC Brazilian  ] [MISC Arab  ] community . 
These officials claim they want to avoid stirring up , offending or alienating this putatively politically influential community . 
However , the commentary of these three prominent [MISC Arab  ] [MISC Brazilians  ] , along with our previous conversations with [MISC Lebanese  ] [MISC Christian  ] leaders ( Ref A ) , suggest there is no strong or cohesive [MISC Arab  ] [MISC Christian  ] or [MISC Muslim  ] voting bloc in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
( The [ORG Arab-Brazilian Chamber of Commerce  ] , whose members include the Ambassadors of [ORG Arab League  ] nations with diplomatic representation in [LOC Brazil  ] , is actively engaged in promoting [MISC Arab  ] culture and has close ties to the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] , but its political activity and influence are limited . 
) Moreover , mainstream political commentators and analysts post has spoken to have stated that ethnicity and religion in [LOC Brazil  ] tend not to influence political orientation to a great extent . 
Even the more dominant [MISC Lebanese  ] [MISC Christians  ] do not constitute a monolithic political bloc . 
In fact , the broader [MISC Arab  ] community - [MISC Christian  ] or [MISC Muslim  ] - may share certain interests and affinities , such as an attachment to the homeland , but these sub-groups do not appear to be keenly interested in the [LOC Middle East  ] political scene . 
This begs the larger question of what is really driving the [MISC Brazilian  ] government 's sometimes controversial and contradictory policies in the [LOC Middle East  ] .
