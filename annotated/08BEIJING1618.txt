) Students appear to be taking heed , though some have told us they remain frustrated and angry at the [LOC West 's  ] " unfair " criticism of [LOC China  ] 's [LOC Tibet  ] policies and the humiliation of [MISC Olympic  ] torch runners .

End Summary . 
Anti-French Protests -------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) Prior to this past week , anti-Western , especially anti-French , sentiment had been on the rise in many parts of [LOC China  ] , as manifested by fiery on-line rhetoric among [LOC China  ] 's netizens and demonstrations in a number of [MISC Chinese  ] cities . 
For example , demonstrators gathered outside locations of the [MISC French  ] supermarket giant [ORG Carrefour  ] throughout [LOC China  ] April 18-20 . 
The protests started in part due to a widely held belief ( later denied by the company ) that a major [ORG Carrefour  ] stockholder has provided financial aid to organizations advocating [MISC Tibetan  ] independence . 
[LOC France  ] 's " mishandling " of the torch relay and [MISC French  ] President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's potential " snubbing " of the [MISC Olympic  ] opening ceremonies also fueled the demonstrations . 
While largely peaceful , demonstrations in some cities took a xenophobic and violent turn . 
In [LOC Zhuzhou  ] , [LOC Hunan Province  ] , a mob reportedly attacked an [MISC American  ] [MISC English  ] teacher , whom they apparently mistakenly assumed was [MISC French  ] , as he emerged from a [ORG Carrefour  ] April 20 . 
Other signs of rising patriotic and anti-French sentiment included a photo circulating on the [MISC Internet  ] showing a taxi in [LOC Shandong Province  ] with a sign in the back window that reads , " Refuse to carry [MISC Frenchmen  ] and dogs . 
" An [MISC Internet  ] cartoon widely circulated among [MISC Chinese  ] youth via e-mail depicts a character severely beating a would-be [ORG Carrefour  ] shopper . 
On Saturday , April 18 , there were small demonstrations in [LOC Beijing  ] front of the [MISC French  ] Embassy and a nearby [MISC French  ] school . 
" Patriotism Should Be Rational " ------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) As the anti-French protests reached a peak over the weekend of April 19-20 , [LOC China  ] 's propaganda apparatus on April 19 began a campaign to calm public anger . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] this new propaganda phase grew out of a decision made at an April 18 [ORG Politburo Standing Committee  ] ( [ORG PBSC  ] ) meeting . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , at the meeting , [LOC China  ] 's leadership decided that the goal of utilizing the [MISC Chinese  ] public to " protest against and warn " [MISC Western  ] countries had " already succeeded . 
" Therefore , before nationalist sentiment spun off in unwanted directions domestically or led to a dramatic shift in [MISC Western  ] countries' attitudes toward [LOC China  ] , the [ORG Center  ] should move to curb growing patriotic fervor . 
Prior to April 18 , central authorities had been deliberately fanning the flames of nationalism , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , claiming that acquaintances in the [ORG Party Propaganda Department  ] had been posing as bloggers or online commentators , purposefully posting rhetoric designed to fuel anti-Western feelings , assisted by the official media 's exceptionally hard-line propaganda . 
[ORG Party Propaganda Department  ] head [PER Liu Yunshan  ] was reportedly directly behind these policies . 
Now , however , the [ORG Center  ] has decided to " stop playing with fire , " [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Following the April 19 [ORG Xinhua News Agency  ] piece calling for more " rational " expressions of nationalism , other media pieces appeared emphasizing the same line while also attempting to directly dampen anti-French sentiment . 
In a story that ran in [MISC Chinese  ] papers April 21 , the [ORG Xinhua News Agency  ] reported denials by [ORG Carrefour  ] 's CEO that the company supported [MISC Tibetan  ] independence . 
The cover of the April 22 edition of [ORG Beijing News  ] ( Xinjing [MISC Bao  ] ) carried a photo of a dormitory building at the [ORG Beijing Institute of Technology  ] with numerous [MISC Chinese  ] flags flying outside the windows . 
The [LOC BEIJING  ] 00001618 002 OF 003 caption quotes school officials as saying that displaying the flag is a " rational " ( li xing ) and " normal " expression of the student 's patriotism . 
On April 23 , newspapers printed another [ORG Xinhua  ] story , this one quoting a [ORG Ministry of Commerce  ] official praising [ORG Carrefour  ] for providing 40,000 jobs in [LOC China  ] , selling mostly [MISC Chinese  ] products and supporting the [LOC Beijing  ] [MISC Games  ] . 
Students Told To Stop Anti-French Protests ------------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) This pro-Carrefour propaganda campaign , according to our contacts , corresponded with more direct efforts by security and [ORG Communist Party  ] officials to stop university students in [LOC Beijing  ] from participating in further demonstrations . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , told [PER PolOff  ] that two [ORG Ministry of State Security  ] agents approached him [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to demand that the [ORG Institute  ] cancel a public discussion on nationalism scheduled to take plac the following day . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , security forces had also " spoken with " at least [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] activists to warn them against any further anti-Western activities . 
At [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [PER PolOff  ] [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] that the university 's [ORG Communist Party  ] committee had likewise issued instructions to students to cease all demonstrations . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , added that all [ORG class-level Party  ] representatives were enlisted to ensure the message reached the entire student body . 
" [MISC West Blindly Sympathetic Toward Dalai Lama  ] " -------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) While protests have subsided , students we spoke with still expressed frustration at the [LOC West  ] 's reaction to events in [LOC Tibet  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
The students all said they were angered by " biased " [MISC Western  ] media reports of the March 14 [LOC Lhasa  ] riots , singling [ORG CNN  ] out for special criticism . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told [PER PolOff  ] that she sensed in [MISC Western  ] media reporting a reflexive sympathy for [MISC Tibetans  ] and a deliberate downplaying of the violence ethnic [MISC Tibetan  ] rioters in [LOC Lhasa  ] inflicted on innocent Han [MISC Chinese  ] . 
[LOC France  ] had become the focus of nationalist anger , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] because [LOC Paris  ] police seemed to favour the pro-Tibet protestors and allowed them to attack the torch . 
While many [MISC Chinese  ] are angry with the [LOC United States  ] for supporting the [PER Dalai Lama  ] , they said , just as many appreciate President [PER Bush  ] 's rejection of an [MISC Olympic  ] boycott. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) While all the students acknowledged problems in [LOC Tibet  ] , especially the difficulty in ensuring that more [MISC Tibetans  ] benefit from [LOC China  ] 's economic growth , they accused the [MISC West of  ] ignoring the " real progress " [LOC China  ] has made . 
While none of the students has participated in the anti-French protests , all said the unrest in [LOC Tibet  ] and the disruptions of the [MISC Olympic  ] torch relay had made them feel more patriotic . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added that her undergraduate classmates who are currently studying abroad have had the strongest reaction and many have added patriotic slogans to their instant messaging IDs . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and her classmates , however , cautioned against exaggerating the long-term impact of the anti-French/ anti-West protests . 
While emotions are still running high [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , " all of this will be forgotten if the [MISC Games  ] go well . 
" [ORG Singapore Media  ] " Most Reliable " ------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) While focusing most of their ire on [MISC Western  ] media and governments , the students also had harsh reviews of the [MISC Chinese  ] leadership . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] criticized the [MISC Chinese  ] [ORG Government  ] 's rhetoric on [LOC Tibet  ] as " overly shrill " and " ineffective " in swaying international opinion . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said [LOC China  ] 's official press provided inadequate coverage of the [LOC Lhasa  ] riots and did not provide enough information to counter the " biased " [MISC Western  ] media reports . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and other students said that , in addition to [ORG Beijing University  ] 's internal [MISC Internet  ] bulletin board , they rely most heavily on [LOC Singapore  ] 's [ORG Lianhe Zaobao  ] newspaper for information on [LOC Tibet  ] and the torch relay . 
[LOC Singapore  ] 's media " understands " [LOC China  ] better than [MISC Western  ] papers , they said , yet is not subject to [MISC Chinese  ] Government censorship . 
The same could not be said of [MISC Hong Kong-based Phoenix Television  ] , they told [PER PolOff  ] . 
Though widely available on [ORG Beijing University  ] 's campus , [LOC Phoenix  ] is " too close to the [MISC Chinese  ] Government " to be of much use . 
" We Saved the [MISC Tibetans  ] " [LOC BEIJING  ] 00001618 003 OF 003 ----------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Two twenty-something professionals , both of whom were recently accepted into [ORG Duke University  ] 's [MISC MBA  ] program , echoed the frustrations of the [ORG Beijing University  ] students in a conversation with PolOff April 23 . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , complained about the " bias " of [ORG CNN  ] . 
Westerners do not understand the " true story " about [LOC Tibet  ] , [PER Li  ] asserted , adding that [LOC China  ] " saved [MISC Tibetans  ] from slavery . 
" [PER XXXXXXXXXXX  ] said his generation is more " pro-establishment " than young people in most other parts of the world . 
Members of [LOC China  ] 's " 80s generation , " [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added , have benefited greatly from [LOC China  ] 's reforms and , though young , still remember the relative poverty of the late 1980s and early 1990s . 
While this does not mean all [MISC Chinese  ] youth support the [ORG Communist Party  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained , pride in [LOC China  ] 's recent accomplishments does make them rally around the flag when they see [LOC China  ] criticized abroad . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , however , said [LOC China  ] 's Government has moved quickly to limit the anti-French protests because it wants to avoid a repeat of 2005 , when anti-Japanese protests " got out of control . 
" <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said young [MISC Chinese  ] tend to be suspicious , even dismissive , of government propaganda except when it comes to issues of national unity . 
A lifetime of political indoctrination has conditioned [MISC Chinese  ] of all ages to react emotionally to perceived separatists threats , which makes [LOC China  ] appear irrational and thin-skinned to the outside world . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , however , noted positive differences between recent anti-French demonstrations and the 2005 anti-Japanese protests . 
First , he said , the number of actual demonstrators outside [ORG Carrefour  ] branches was very small . 
In most cases , spectators greatly outnumbered the protestors . 
Second , in contrast to previous nationalist incidents , there was a much wider debate on the [MISC Internet  ] about the appropriateness of anti-Western protests . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he was struck by the large number of [MISC Chinese  ] netizens who voiced opposition to the [ORG Carrefour  ] boycott . 
He said this is a " positive sign " that may indicate [MISC Chinese  ] attitudes towards the outside world are growing more mature . 
Comment ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Patriotic sentiment , especially among students , appears sincere and on the rise , even though the Government has clearly played a role in fanning such feelings . 
[MISC Chinese  ] Government efforts over the past week to put a lid on overt nationalist demonstrations has so far been effective . 
The message now emphasized by [LOC China  ] 's propaganda organs is that holding a successful [MISC Olympics  ] , not rash protests , is the best answer to [MISC Western  ] criticism . 
Our contacts quoted above , all of whom are well-educated and internationally oriented , agree with this sentiment . 
Nevertheless , they do appear to have been genuinely stung by what they see as a sudden and " unfair " rejection of [LOC China  ] by many [MISC Western  ] countries .
