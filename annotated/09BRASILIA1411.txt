( C ) Mission [LOC Brazil  ] warmly welcomes your visit to [LOC Brasilia  ] . 
It is more than a courtesy to say that your trip comes at a significant time for [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] relations . 
A promising start with the new [ORG U.S. Administration  ] is beginning to ebb as high-level initiatives have been delayed and [LOC Brazil  ] has staked out positions at odds with [ORG USG  ] views on such issues as [LOC Honduras  ] , [LOC Colombia/Venezuela  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , non-proliferation , and the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process . 
At the same time , as [LOC Brazil  ] continues its rapid transformation from a regional to a global power , [ORG USG  ] engagement with [LOC Brazil  ] has continued to expand on a growing range of issues of importance to the [LOC United States  ] , including global trade and finance , climate change , alternative fuels , regional energy integration , food security , [ORG UN Security Council  ] matters , and trilateral cooperation in [LOC Haiti  ] , [LOC Africa  ] and elsewhere . 
The [ORG GOB  ] remains eager to deepen bilateral engagement , and the possibilities to expand our productive economic engagement into other areas remain ample . 
As the [ORG Lula Government  ] heads into its final year , your visit provides the opportunity to provide new impetus to the still-considerable positive momentum in our relationship , and to lay the groundwork for a more strategic partnership with a new [MISC Brazilian  ] government . 
A Rapidly Emerging Global Power... <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's status as one of the world 's top-ten economies has received a boost over the past year from the continuation of solid economic management and better-than-expected performance through the global financial crisis and economic downturn . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's growing economic clout and potential for an estimated 5% annual GDP growth during the next several years , combined with an aggressive effort by the [ORG Lula  ] government to increase the country 's international reach and the new prominence on the multilateral agenda of issues such as climate change on which [LOC Brazil  ] is a necessary player , is encouraging this former global wallflower to make its presence felt on the world stage in ways that would have seemed unlikely only a decade ago. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's ascendancy is being driven by a strong and still strengthening democracy , a more open and stable economy , a competitive inward- and outward-looking private sector , a deepening S&T capability , and an ample natural resource base . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is now the world 's third largest agricultural exporter after the [LOC United States  ] and the [ORG European Union  ] and the second-largest issuer of [MISC ADRs  ] on the [ORG New York Stock Exchange  ] . 
Already a global leader in alternative fuels and self-sufficient in oil , recent discoveries of offshore ( so-called " pre-salt " ) oil , while difficult to exploit , give [LOC Brazil  ] the potential to become a major global oil producer and exporter over the next decade . 
Over the past two years , [LOC Brazil  ] has played a critical role in shaping the international economic system through its participation in the [LOC Doha Round  ] and its leadership in the G20 . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is making a transition from a recipient to a provider of assistance , mostly through technical cooperation . 
[LOC Brazil  ] officially became an [ORG IMF  ] " creditor " country this year and has pledged to increase its contribution to the [ORG IMF  ] . 
( For additional background on [LOC Brazil  ] 's economy and economic positions , see the scenesetter for the bilateral [ORG Economic Policy Dialogue  ] , reftel . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Under [ORG Lula  ] , the [ORG GOB  ] has dramatically increased its contacts with and presence in [LOC Africa  ] , [LOC Asia  ] ( including [LOC North Korea  ] ) , and the [LOC Middle East  ] ( especially [LOC Iran  ] ) , opening some 48 posts abroad over the last seven years and increasing its diplomatic corps by 50% . 
While maintaining its focus on [MISC South American  ] integration through [ORG MERCOSUL  ] and UNASUL-institutions largely of its making--and preserving its longstanding multilateral encounters with the [LOC United States  ] through the [ORG Summit  ] of the [ORG Americas  ] , with the [ORG EU  ] through both regional and bilateral dialogues , and with [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Portugal  ] through the [ORG Ibero-American Summit  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] has been the driving force behind a series of new multilateral gatherings , including the [LOC BRIC  ] ( [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC India  ] , [LOC China  ] ) , [LOC IBSA  ] ( [LOC India  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC South Africa  ] ) , [ORG ASSA  ] ( [ORG Southern Africa-South America )  ] , [ORG ASPA  ] ( [MISC South America-Arab Countries  ] ) , and [ORG CALC  ] ( [ORG Summit  ] of [LOC Latin America  ] and the [LOC Caribbean  ] ) . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's top foreign policy priority remains obtaining a seat on the [ORG UN Security Council  ] and , as it takes its place in January as a non-permanent [ORG UNSC  ] member for the tenth time , it is aware that its actions will be closely watched. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] has begun to take more visible and assertive positions on a broader range of issues of interest to the [MISC United States-sometimes  ] helpfully , often not . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's participation in the [LOC Doha Round  ] , G20 talks , and , more recently , the preparations for the [ORG UNFCCC COP-15  ] , has been serious and generally constructive . 
Unlike the other two giant emerging economies , [LOC China  ] and [LOC India  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] is bringing to [LOC Copenhagen  ] a goal to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions: a reduction of between 36-39% by 2020 compared with " business as usual , " which translates to about a 25% decline compared with 2005 . 
( The [ORG USG  ] is proposing a 17% decline for 2020 compared with 2005 . 
) [LOC Brazil  ] 's own military and civilian nuclear programs have made it more difficult to work with on non-proliferation , and have led to the [ORG GOB  ] 's refusal to sign an Additional Protocol and lop-sided advocacy of [LOC Iran  ] 's rights to civilian nuclear technology . 
Even further from [LOC Brazil  ] 's historical interests , high-level exchanges of visits with [LOC Iran  ] and increasingly intense engagement in the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process are among recent high-profile forays into new areas of global import . 
Statements on [MISC North Korean  ] missile tests , [LOC China  ] 's crackdown in [LOC Tibet  ] , and elections in [LOC Zimbabwe  ] are other instances where [LOC Brazil  ] has stepped into new territory. ...With the Emphasis on " Emerging " <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) If [LOC Brazil  ] 's rapid emergence on the global stage is unquestionable , it is also true that it is very much still emerging . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's clear sense of purpose in [LOC South America  ] , where the overriding importance of maintaining stability on its poorly protected borders has led to an emphasis on dialogue and integration with its ten neighbors , is not in evidence on most extra-regional issues . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's objective in achieving a seat at the table on many global issues seems to stop at the seat itself . 
In part , this stems from a general [MISC Brazilian  ] disposition to prefer dialogue with other countries to confrontation or isolation . 
It is also driven by [ORG Lula  ] 's determination to develop and maintain friendly relations with all global players as [LOC Brazil  ] seeks a permanent seat on the [ORG UN Security Council  ] . 
The end result is that [LOC Brazil  ] often remains reticent to take firm positions on key global issues and generally seeks ways to avoid them . 
More often than not , the [ORG GOB  ] eschews positions of leadership that might require overtly choosing sides . 
Its discomfort with the spotlight has been on full display in the aftermath of the [LOC Honduras  ] coup: thrust into the center of the crisis when President [PER Zelaya  ] appeared on its embassy doorstep , [LOC Brazil  ] did very little to extricate itself or to actively pursue a resolution , instead handing responsibility to the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Less obviously , [LOC Brazil  ] remains uncomfortable in its leadership on [MISC MINUSTAH  ] . 
To the constant refrain of " we cannot continue this indefinitely , " [LOC Brazil  ] has been increasingly insistent that international efforts to promote security must go hand in hand with commitments to economic and social development-a theme it will take to the [ORG UNSC  ] in January . 
[LOC Brazil  ] maintains a frustrating double-standard on democracy and human rights . 
Although a founding member of the [ORG Community of Democracies and Partnership for Democratic Governance  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] rarely stands firm on these issues ; even its stubbornly rigid support of [PER Zelaya  ] ( more so than democracy ) in [LOC Honduras  ] stands in stark contrast to [PER Lula  ] 's unquestioning acceptance of [MISC Iranian  ] President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's re-election . 
And in the wake of what it considered a near-disastrous brush with election observation in [LOC Zimbabwe  ] last year , the [ORG GOB  ] has opted to focus on technical cooperation related to running elections , in lieu of observing them . 
In the [ORG UN  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] generally chooses to abstain even on resolutions regarding the most egregious human rights abuses-such as those in [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC North Korea  ] , and [MISC Sudan-unless  ] it considers evidence of non-cooperation with international human rights bodies to be clear-cut ( as in [LOC Burma  ] , for example ) . <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Where [LOC Brazil  ] 's policy is not hesitant , it is often ill-informed or straight-jacketed by the policies of the past . 
As it steps out on [LOC Middle East  ] issues , the [ORG GOB  ] does so with a lack of expertise on the region . 
Inclined to take assertions from the [MISC Syrians  ] , [MISC Iranians  ] , and [ORG Hizbullah  ] at face value , it insists that peace can be achieved only if all players are at the table , and seeks to position itself as a neutral party , " the country who can talk to everyone , " over against what it perceives as the biased [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC European  ] efforts . 
This penchant for dialogue stands together with respect for sovereignty and non-intervention in internal affairs as the hallmarks of [MISC Brazilian  ] foreign policy . 
But as [LOC Brazil  ] plays in a growing number of international arenas , it is finding it more difficult to remain true to these principles , and more difficult to hide its inconsistencies. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [LOC Brazil  ] 's uneven foreign policy is mirrored by continued growing pains at home . 
Impressive strides over the last twenty years in establishing stable democratic institutions are tarnished by a dysfunctional judicial system , lack of enforcement capability , and persistent and widespread corruption . 
Even as [LOC Brazil  ] 's middle class continues to grow , the income gap remains significant and the country is still home to the largest number of poor in the hemisphere , with some 50 million concentrated in the northeast . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's successful multinationals and vibrant entrepreneurial class are constrained by an inhospitable business climate , a costly and intrusive but inefficient government bureaucracy , R&D spending that focuses on producing articles for publications rather than innovation , and inadequate national transportation , communications , and energy infrastructure networks . 
Although it is heading to [LOC Copenhagen  ] with an ambitious proposal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the lowest rates of deforestation on record , the [ORG GOB  ] has made very little headway in straightening out the land ownership issues in the [LOC Amazon  ] ( where only about four percent of the land is clearly titled ) or in providing sustainable economic activities for the more than 25 million people living in the region . 
Without resolving those issues , the pressure to clear the [LOC Amazon  ] to support one 's family will remain as great as ever . 
Though proud of its status as a " melting pot " in which different cultures and races exist side-by-side , racism remains a real and largely unacknowledged problem , and [LOC Brazil  ] 's indigenous population of some 700,000 individuals , scattered across the country in 225 different societies , continues to suffer from prejudice , violence , and marginalization. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Nonetheless , [LOC Brazil  ] continues to make progress across the board . 
Although the average [MISC Brazilian  ] remains inward-looking and often ignorant of world developments , a burgeoning public interest in the [LOC United States  ] has made [LOC Brazil  ] one of the four largest visa-issuing and -adjudicating [LOC U.S.  ] missions worldwide . 
[LOC Brazil  ] continues to struggle with unresolved military dictatorship-era human rights violations , but is nonetheless moving successfully to reintegrate the military into the mainstream of national policy . 
Organized crime , urban murder rates often ten times those in the most violent [LOC U.S.  ] cities , and the second largest consumption of cocaine in the world are in need of urgent attention , but [LOC Brazil  ] 's professional , well-trained [ORG Federal Police  ] works as an effective partner with [ORG USG  ] law enforcement agencies . 
Public education remains sub-standard , the [ORG Landless Movement  ] ( [ORG MST  ] ) continues to attract the rural disenfranchised , and the government is largely absent from the favelas of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] , and other major cities , whose millions of residents are often caught between criminal gangs and corrupt civil and military ( uniformed ) police . 
But [LOC Brazil  ] has developed innovative social programs , and its [ORG Bolsa Familia  ] conditional-transfer program is considered an international example . 
Relations with the [ORG United States: Can Brazil  ] Overcome Its Inferiority Complex ? <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) This [ORG Mission  ] has been saying in its scenesetters that bilateral relations are as good as they have ever been-certainly in decades . 
This is true , and the evidence is ample: a burgeoning set of government-to-government dialogues covering economic , commercial , scientific , defense , and foreign policy has led to rapidly expanding cooperation: an MOU on biofuels cooperation , increased numbers of joint exercises between our militaries , trilateral cooperation in [LOC Africa  ] and [LOC Haiti  ] on such issues as health , food security , and institutional strengthening , and an innovative agreement to fight racial and ethnic discrimination. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) At the same time , we face significant historical baggage in the way [LOC Brazil  ] 's foreign policy establishment views the [LOC United States  ] , which slows our ability to build a fully cooperative relationship with [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Much of [LOC Brazil  ] 's foreign policy establishment remains cautious and mistrustful toward the [LOC United States  ] . 
Bilaterally , a growing and pragmatic interest in cooperating with the [LOC United States  ] on a range of technical and practical issues is often caught up in fears that [LOC Brazil  ] will lose sovereign control or will find itself a junior partner on its own soil to better funded , staffed , and organized [ORG USG  ] partners . 
This has led to persistent problems with visas for [LOC U.S.  ] law enforcement agencies ( particularly , but not exclusively , on counterterrorism issues ) , refusal to accept [ORG USG  ] assistance , and seemingly unreasonable demands and strictures on various types of cooperation . 
More concerted [ORG Mission  ] efforts to reach out to non-traditional executive branch agencies and non-executive branch partners-state and municipal governments , the judiciary , prosecutors , legislators , the private sector , and civil society-have sometimes been greeted with concern , suspicion , and occasional opposition by a [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] jealous of its historical lead on all international issues and self-designated role as both definer and protector of [LOC Brazil  ] 's national interests vis-C -vis the world. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Within [LOC South America  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] sees the [LOC United States  ] as a competitor and remains deeply suspicious of our motives and intentions . 
Although the notion that the [LOC United States  ] harbors plans to invade or internationalize the [LOC Amazon  ] or to seize [LOC Brazil  ] 's offshore oil may seem preposterous to [MISC Americans  ] , concerns about such plans surface regularly among senior [MISC Brazilian  ] officials , academics , and journalists , and are only the most outlandish manifestation of generalized mistrust and insecurity with regard to the [LOC United States  ] presence in the region . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's reaction to the [LOC U.S.  ] base agreement with [LOC Colombia  ] reflected , in large measure , just such concerns , as have its veiled efforts to scuttle the 3+1 [ORG Security Dialogue  ] with [LOC Paraguay  ] and [LOC Argentina  ] . 
The [LOC United States  ] is not the only one subject to the [MISC Brazilian  ] mistrust ; The [ORG GOB  ] now requires all [ORG NGOs  ] operating in the [LOC Amazon  ] region to be registered and has tightened controls related to land ownership by foreigners in the area. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Outside [LOC South America  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] 's discomfort with the [LOC United States  ] is less in evidence , but it is careful to avoid any suggestion that it is toeing a [LOC U.S.  ] line , is intent on avoiding situations in which it might be perceived as a junior partner , and tends to see an " independent " position-i.e. , independent of the [LOC United States  ] in the first instance , and wealthy countries more generally-as the preferred default . 
Nor does [LOC Brazil  ] want to be lumped in with the mass of developing countries . 
In multilateral settings , [LOC Brazil  ] prefers to position itself as a " bridge " between the wealthy and developing nations . 
In cooperating with us in [LOC Africa  ] , it has been careful to limit cooperation to those areas where it can act plausibly as an equal partner . 
Across the board , engagement with the [LOC United States  ] has been pragmatic , rather than strategic . 
As it looks for strategic partners , [LOC Brazil  ] is showing a clear preference for other " independent " emerging powers-South [LOC Africa  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] , [LOC Ukraine  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC China  ] , [MISC India-and  ] for one " independent " world power: [LOC France  ] . 
This ( long-standing ) affinity for the [MISC French  ] , which has been amply reciprocated by President [PER Sarkozy  ] and his government , has been most evident in the [MISC FX-2  ] fighter competition , in which both [PER Lula  ] and Defense Minister [PER Nelson Jobim  ] have expressed a clear preference for the [MISC French  ] aircraft despite [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] evaluations that show the clear superiority and cheaper price of the [LOC U.S.  ] fighter . 
An Eager [LOC Brazil  ] Gives Us the Opportunity to Invest for the [MISC Long-Term  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In spite of their reticence , [MISC Brazilians  ] continue to show a genuine interest in deepening relations with the [LOC United States  ] . 
Economic issues are proving to be the easiest pathway to more productive engagement with the [ORG GOB  ] , both because , as a large emerging economy , [LOC Brazil  ] is beginning to have a natural seat at the table and because the [ORG GOB  ] sees most easily how global economic issues directly impact its own well-being and national security . 
The [ORG GOB  ] has shown itself a willing partner in efforts on bilateral investment and trade issues that will increase business opportunities , job growth , and economic development . 
At the same time , we are cooperating with [LOC Brazil  ] to address the regulatory , legal and infrastructure challenges that constrain [LOC Brazil  ] 's growth and social inclusion goals and hurt [LOC U.S.  ] exporters and investors. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) We are also building these partnerships with the goal of promote regional and global economic and social inclusion goals--among them , addressing the global financial crisis , opening trade , and stimulating cooperation on economic development . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's interest in taking on a mantle of global economic leadership offers numerous opportunities for engagement , as we encourage [LOC Brazil  ] to take on increasingly responsible roles globally . 
As always , it is important to frame approaches to the [ORG GOB  ] as a partner , and not a junior partner . 
However , constructive engagement in the [MISC G20  ] has given [LOC Brazil  ] increased confidence that it can and should engage in issues outside its own borders , and the [ORG GOB  ] takes deserved pride in having overcome many experiences ( previous financial crises , addressing [MISC GINI  ] inequalities , infrastructure impact on growth , etc ) common to developing country , and sees itself as uniquely placed to use its " lessons learned " to help other developing countries tackle their own challenges . 
The [ORG GOB  ] has been receptive to partnering with us on development cooperation , including a newly developing initiative in [LOC Mozambique  ] and [LOC Haiti  ] on agriculture , health and infrastructure development . 
We continue to work with [LOC Brazil  ] to build consensus for [ORG WTO  ] trade liberalization ; to promote enhanced cooperation in fora such as [ORG OECD  ] , [ORG WHO  ] , and [ORG ICAO  ] ; and to create the conditions for global development and prosperity. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Our economic engagement provides a bridge to building our relationship with the [ORG GOB  ] on other issues . 
Although they generally require more careful groundwork and legwork to ensure success , the possibilities to do so remain ample . 
In a country that seeks nothing so much as recognition of its " rightful " place on the international stage , there is widespread understanding that no other country can legitimize [LOC Brazil  ] 's aspirations in so meaningful a way as the [LOC United States  ] . 
More immediately , the prospect for advancing beyond a pragmatic partnership received a significant boost with the election of President [PER Obama  ] . 
Although [MISC Brazilians  ] generally admire the [LOC United States  ] and maintain a strong interest in our culture and politics , from President [PER Lula  ] to the man on the street they see in the President a kindred spirit whom they are eager to engage . 
The [ORG Administration  ] 's early statements and actions with regard to [MISC Latin America-the President  ] 's meeting with [ORG UNASUL  ] and efforts to reach out at the [MISC Summit of the Americas  ] , the spirit of negotiation at the [ORG OAS General Assembly  ] , efforts to reinitiate dialogue with [LOC Cuba  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] , and [ORG Bolivia-were  ] all well received in [LOC Brazil  ] , and heightened expectations of an even closer relationship . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] officials were impressed by what they heard from General Jones , Under Secretary [PER Tauscher  ] , and other senior officials during their visit in [LOC August.  ] <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) In the intervening months , both official and non-official [MISC Brazilians  ] have become increasingly disappointed with what they perceive as a lack of attention from the [LOC United States  ] . 
While acknowledging that the [LOC United States  ] has pressing domestic and international priorities , [MISC Brazilians  ] feel more than ever that their successes-their performance through the financial crisis , constructive engagement in the [ORG WTO  ] and [LOC Copenhagen  ] , creative social programs , and even their successful bids for the 2014 [MISC World Cup  ] and the 2016 Summer Olympics-have earned them a more prominent place on the [LOC U.S.  ] agenda . 
With regard to the [ORG GOB  ] in particular , the [LOC Colombia  ] bases problem seemed to be evidence of a lack on the part of the [ORG USG  ] both of transparency in our dealings in the region and of consideration regarding matters that have a direct impact on [LOC Brazil  ] 's security . 
Although initially pleased with the [ORG USG  ] response to the coup in [LOC Honduras  ] , and despite having publicly insisted the problem was ours to resolve , the [ORG GOB  ] saw our position in support of [MISC Honduran  ] democratic process ( rather than a firm insistence on [LOC Zelaya  ] 's restoration ) as a step away from consensus-building in the region. <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) Despite this frustration , the [ORG GOB  ] remains eager to engage , and holds out continued hope that [LOC Brazil  ] will receive a visit from President [PER Obama  ] in the coming months . 
The [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] is in the process of creating and increasing staffing for a higher level department ( equivalent to a [ORG Department of State bureau  ] ) to handle [LOC United States  ] , [LOC Canada  ] , and [ORG Inter-American Affairs  ] . 
Uncharacteristically , the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] has extended a series of new offers and taken up others it has long delayed: it is eager to launch the proposed high-level dialogue , has sought to replicate the success of the [ORG Joint Action Plan to Fight Racial Discrimination  ] by proposing an [ORG MOU  ] on gender issues , is moving forward on a [ORG Defense Cooperation Agreement  ] , [MISC Pol-Mil  ] talks , trilateral cooperation in [LOC Haiti  ] and [LOC Africa  ] , and a [LOC Tropical Forest Conservation Act  ] agreement , has offered an [ORG MOU  ] on climate change , and has expressed repeated interest in establishing joint counternarcotics cooperation with [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
While getting to yes on these initiatives will undoubtedly require the same patience and care to avoid [MISC Brazilian  ] sensitivities that mark almost all of our daily interactions with the [ORG GOB  ] , the evident interest at senior levels of the presidency and foreign ministry in building up the relationship should help smooth the way over the next months. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) As keen as they are to cultivate the [ORG Obama Administration  ] , [ORG GOB  ] officials are also driven by the knowledge that their timeframe for making meaningful progress is short . 
There is little more than a year left of the [PER Lula  ] government ; only ten months until elections for president , all 27 governors , two-thirds of the senate , and all federal and state deputies ; just over six months before official campaigning begins ; and less than four months until ministers who intend to run for office-perhaps as many as half of [PER Lula  ] 's cabinet-must resign . 
This election-year calendar will be further complicated by the traditional slowdown during [LOC Brazil  ] 's extended summer/Christmas/Carnival break . 
Nonetheless , the continuity provided by [LOC Brazil  ] 's influential diplomatic corps and the likelihood of broad continuity on both foreign and domestic policy under either of the two strongest contenders to succeed [PER Lula  ] on January 1 , 2011 means that initiatives put into place now will lay the groundwork for the new [MISC Brazilian  ] government. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOB  ] will be looking for signs in your visit that [ORG USG  ] interest in engaging [LOC Brazil  ] as a global partner has not waned . 
While [ORG GOB  ] officials are unlikely to give on the issues that have proved contentious over the last months , they will value the opportunity to explain their views , will want to hear the [ORG Administration  ] 's perspective and aspirations with regard to [LOC Brazil  ] , and will seriously entertain suggestions for additional engagement . 
Your visit provides the opportunity to forge a durable working relationship over the next year and to lay the foundation for a strategic bilateral relationship with the next [MISC Brazilian  ] government that will also be essential to influencing the direction of [LOC Brazil  ] 's development as a maturing global actor .
