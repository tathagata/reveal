<code><pre>Thursday , 17 December 2009 , 07:09 C O N F I D E N T I A L KAMPALA 001399 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 2019/12/17 TAGS PHUM , PGOV , UG SUBJECT: UGANDA: ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON 2002 [ORG GULU PRISON  ] INCIDENT REF: STATE 112641 CLASSIFIED BY: [PER Aaron Sampson  ] , Pol/Econ Chief , State , Pol/Econ ; REASON: 1.4 ( B ) , ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] The following information responds to reftel questions regarding the 2002 death of [PER Peter Oloya  ] at [ORG Gulu Central Prison  ] . 
In 2003 , the [ORG Ugandan High Court  ] described Mr. Oloya’s death as “a blatant case of extra judicial killing.” Relying on the testimony of one eyewitness , and the [MISC Ugandan  ] government’s failure to produce any eyewitnesses or signed affidavits to the contrary , the [ORG High Court  ] concluded [PER Oloya  ] was shot on the orders of Lt. Col. [PER Otema  ] . 
Our efforts to investigate the 2002 killing produced no additional information . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Who was in command of the [ORG UPDF  ] forces that went to [LOC Gulu  ] prison ? - Lt. Col. [PER Charles Anway Otema  ] was in charge of [ORG UPDF  ] forces that went to [LOC Gulu  ] prison and accompanied these forces to the prison. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) What was the relationship of the commanding officer of the forces entering the prison in the chain of command to then-Lt . 
Col. [PER Otema  ] ? - Lt. Col. [PER Charles Anway  ] [PER Otema  ] was the commanding officer of the forces that entered the prison , and entered the prison along with forces under his command. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) What were the orders of the detachment that went to [ORG Gulu Prison  ] ? 
Were these given by then-Lt . 
Col. [PER Otema  ] ? 
Did these specifically address safeguarding prisoners ? - On November 3 , 2009 , [LOC Gulu District  ] Chairman [PER Walter Ochora  ] told [PER PolOff  ] that he , Lt. Col. [PER Otema  ] , and President [PER Museveni  ] discussed an intercepted message on September 16 , 2002 , revealing plans by the [ORG Lord’s Resistance Army  ] ( [ORG LRA  ] ) to liberate prisoners from [LOC Gulu  ] central prison . 
[PER Ochora  ] said President [PER Museveni  ] ordered Lt. Col. [PER Otema  ] to go to the prison , secure the prisoners , and bring them back to the military barracks . 
[PER Ochora  ] said the Director General of Prisons authorized Lt. Col. Otema’s unit entrance to the prison . 
We have no further information on the content of the orders given to Lt. Col. Otema. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) What measures as commander did then-Lt . 
Col. [PER Otema  ] take after the incident ? 
Did he order an investigation ? - The [ORG UPDF  ] has not provided information about the nature or extent of any internal [ORG UPDF  ] investigation . 
Member of Parliament ( MP ) [PER David Penytoo Ocheng  ] , who was incarcerated with [PER Oloya  ] in [LOC Gulu  ] prison at the time of the incident , told [PER PolOff  ] that he rode from the prison in the back of the military truck carrying Oloya’s body . 
[PER Ocheng  ] recalls Lt. Col [PER Otema  ] saying , “Is he dead ? 
Is he dead ? 
If he is dead just bury him.” [PER Ocheng  ] said [PER Oloya  ] was clearly dead , with gunshot exit wounds in the front of his chest . 
Upon arrival at the military barracks , Lt. Col. [PER Otema  ] approached the back of the truck , asked again if [PER Oloya  ] was dead , and ordered the soldiers to carry [PER Oloya  ] to the military barracks hospital . 
[PER Ocheng  ] said that three days later some soldiers at the military barracks told him they had buried a decapitated civilian matching [MISC Oloya’s  ] description with a chest bullet wound. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) If there was an investigation , who conducted the investigation ? - The [ORG UPDF  ] provided no information regarding any internal [ORG UPDF  ] investigations of [MISC Oloya’s  ] killing. - On February 14 , 2003 , the [ORG Ugandan High Court  ] heard an application seeking compensation for the 21 [LOC Gulu  ] prisoners , including [PER Oloya  ] , for violation of human rights . 
The hearing determined whether the claimants were deprived of basic rights , and did not indentify any parties or individuals responsible for depriving the claimants of these rights. - In regard to the shooting death of [PER Oloya  ] , the Uganda’s Attorney General did not dispute that [PER Oloya  ] was fatally shot by [ORG UPDF  ] personnel , but claimed that [PER Oloya  ] was “shot dead accidentally as he attacked one of the soldiers and attempted to disarm him.” [PER Stephan Otim  ] , a fellow prisoner and eyewitness , testified that “as the late [PER Peter Oloya  ] was moving towards the prison gate , Lt. Col. Oteng Awany ordered the soldiers to shoot him...the soldiers then shot [PER Peter Oloya  ] in the back and his body was loaded into a lorry”. - The [ORG High Court  ] said it was “inclined to believe” the version articulated by Oloya’s fellow prisoners . 
The court specifically cited [MISC Otim’s  ] eyewitness affidavit , and the [MISC Ugandan  ] government’s failure to produce any affidavits from Lt. Col. [PER Otema  ] or other eyewitness in response . 
The [PER Court  ] described the Attorney General’s claim of an accidental shooting as “pure fiction” , and found it “inconceivable that a prisoner namely the late [PER Peter Oloya  ] could have attacked and then attempted to disarm one of the soldiers...it is unimaginable that a poor unarmed prisoner would attack a soldier amidst many other heavily armed soldiers.” The [PER Court  ] ruled that “Peter [PER Oloya  ] was intentionally deprived of his right to life when he was shot in cold blood at the orders of Lt. Col [PER Otema  ] Awany . 
His killing was not in execution of a sentence passed in a fair trial by a court of competent jurisdiction in respect of a criminal offence under the laws of [LOC Uganda  ] where such sentence had been confirmed with the highest appellate court . 
This was a blatant case of extra judicial killing by which the right to life of the late [PER Peter Oloya  ] as protected by [ORG Article  ] 22 ( 1 ) of the [MISC Constitution  ] was violated.” The Court found it “surprising” that Lt. Col. [PER Otema  ] “swore no affidavit in reply leading to an irresistible inference that the averments that [PER Peter Oloya  ] was deliberately shot in cold blood at the orders of Lt. Col. [PER Otema  ] Awany are true.” The government appealed this ruling in 2006 but the Attorney General failed to appear and the appeal was subsequently dismissed. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Was it an official investigation ? - The [ORG UPDF  ] did not provide evidence of any internal [ORG UPDF  ] investigation . 
The [ORG High Court  ] case was an official legal hearing into human rights violations . 
The hearing was not a criminal trial , nor did it lead to criminal charges against Lt. Col. [PER Otema  ] or any other party. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Will the [ORG GOU  ] release the investigation results or a summary to us ( with the understanding that the [ORG USG  ] will respect confidentiality ? - We have already emailed scanned copy of the 2003 [ORG High Court  ] ruling to the [LOC Uganda  ] [MISC Desk Officer.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Why did the [ORG UPDF  ] decline to release [PER Peter Oloya’s  ] body ? - The [ORG UPDF  ] provided no information on why it failed to comply with the court order to release the [PER Oloya’s  ] body. - [PER Ochora  ] told [PER PolOff  ] that he and [LOC Gulu District  ] Chairman [PER Norbert Mao  ] recently discussed this case with President [PER Museveni  ] ( the 2003 [ORG High Court  ] ruling notes a petition by [PER Mao  ] for the release of [PER Oloya’s  ] body ) . 
[PER Ochora  ] said the President saw no reason not to return Oloya’s body to relatives and that the [ORG Paramount Chief  ] ( the [PER Acholi King  ] ) should be informed to handle the rituals involved in moving the body. - MP [PER David Penytoo Ocheng  ] said that three days after he and other prisoners were transferred to the military barracks in 2002 , soldiers on burial detail for [ORG UPDF  ] soldiers killed by the [ORG LRA  ] told him they had also buried a decapitated civilian matching [PER Oloya’s  ] description . 
The soldiers told [PER Ocheng  ] that the body bore a large exit wound on the front of the chest. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) If possible , can the [MISC Embassy  ] interview one or more eyewitnesses ( preferably from different points of view , e.g. prison official , prisoner , soldier ) from the [LOC Gulu  ] prison incident ? - Post has been unable to identify any eyewitnesses . 
[PER Ochora  ] was not an eyewitness and was not at the prison at the time the incident occurred . 
[PER Penytoo  ] said he was in an adjacent prison yard when shots were fired . 
Nor are we convinced that locating eyewitnesses seven years after the incident would provide any greater clarity as political and personal sentiments continue to color descriptions of the incident . 
The 2003 [ORG High Court  ] ruling contains a sworn affidavit by one eyewitness , [PER Stephen Otim  ] . 
Neither the [MISC Ugandan  ] government nor the [ORG UPDF  ] produced sworn statements by other eyewitnesses challenging [MISC Otim’s  ] version of events. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) We would appreciate post’s opinion with regard to the credibility of NGO accounts vs. government accounts of this incident . 
We also would appreciate post’s opinion on whether [PER Otema  ] was involved in the incident or not. - There is no dispute that Lt. Col. [PER Otema  ] was present the night [PER Peter Oloya  ] was shot . 
The question is whether [PER Oloya  ] was deliberately shot , and if so was this at Lt. Col. Otema’s orders , or was [PER Oloya  ] shot accidently while trying to wrestle a weapon from one of Lt. Col. Otema’s men . 
We do not feel that we are in a position to go beyond the findings of the [ORG High Court  ] in concluding what actually happened the night of Oloya’s death .
