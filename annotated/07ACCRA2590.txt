BROWN FOR REASONS 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Post provides the following information keyed to ref A request . 
[ORG GOG  ] efforts to addresses narcotics trafficking --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [LOC Ghana  ] is increasingly becoming a significant transshipment point for cocaine from [LOC South America  ] and heroin from [LOC Southwest Asia  ] . 
The majority of the narcotics flow is to [LOC Europe  ] , although seizures have occurred on flights to the [LOC U.S.  ] The [ORG GOG  ] does not have a handle on the issue and lacks an overarching strategy to deal with the problem . 
Despite the unveiling of the [PER Georgina  ] [ORG Wood Report  ] last year , the [ORG GOG  ] has largely failed to implement its recommendations . 
( NOTE: The [ORG Wood Commission  ] was convened after several narcotics scandals and its report listed numerous recommendations for the [ORG GOG  ] to address the narcotics scourge ( ref B ) . 
END NOTE . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOG  ] does not provide the resources necessary to address the problem and , at times , does not appear to have the political will to go after the major drug barons . 
However the [ORG GOG  ] has taken some steps toward educating the public about the perils of narcotics . 
For example , the [ORG Narcotics Control Board  ] ( [ORG NACOB  ] ) , the lead agency in [LOC Ghana  ] on counternarcotics efforts , has instituted awareness programs in schools , airports and other public places . 
The [ORG GOG  ] , together with the [LOC UK  ] , also recently launched [MISC Operation Hibiscus  ] , which aims at deterring people from becoming drug couriers . 
The [ORG GOG  ] was also helpful in the recent arrest and subsequent expulsion to the [LOC U.S.  ] of two [MISC Afghan  ] nationals for heroin trafficking ( ref C ) . 
Bilateral and [ORG International Donors Assistance  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Outside of [LOC U.S.  ] assistance , the [LOC UK  ] has the strongest counternarcotics assistance program in [LOC Ghana  ] . 
[LOC UK  ] assistance is largely channeled through the [ORG Operation Westbridge  ] program , which seeks to interdict narcotics transiting [ORG Kotoka International Airport  ] . 
The program has been successful ; however , [LOC UK  ] contacts have pointed out that seizures in [LOC Accra  ] drop to almost zero when the [ORG Westbridge  ] team , who serves on short term TDYs , is back in [LOC London  ] . 
In an attempt to address this problem , the [LOC UK  ] has now structured its staffing so that at least one [ORG Westbridge  ] official will be in [LOC Accra  ] at all times . 
While the program was initially scheduled to last two years , [LOC UK  ] contacts tell us that it will be extended at least to 2009 . 
The [LOC UK  ] is also assisting the [ORG GOG  ] with a public awareness campaign aimed at deterring couriers . 
The [MISC French  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] , and [MISC Spanish  ] embassies have law enforcement officers who monitor narcotics efforts , but they have done little to date in terms of assistance . 
The [MISC German  ] Embassy sent [ORG NACOB  ] , s operations chief to [LOC Germany  ] for a long-term training session to be completed in early 2008 . 
Law Enforcement Operations -------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG Narcotics Control Board  ] ( [ORG NACOB  ] ) is the lead agency on counternarcotics efforts . 
However , it has been listless over the past year as it has struggled to regain its footing after a series of scandals . 
NACOB’s current director has no law enforcement experience but has a background in pharmaceutical regulation . 
He has confided that he is ready to move on after only six months on the job and seems to [ORG ACCRA  ] 00002590 002.2 OF 003 focus more on prevention than investigations . 
The [LOC Ghana  ] Police has an organized crime unit , which among other things , addresses narcotics trafficking . 
[MISC Ghanaian  ] law enforcement organizations have demonstrated their efficacy on a few occasions . 
If given the blessing of the [ORG GOG  ] , they typically perform well in arresting and apprehending traffickers. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOG  ] seems to focus more on small time dealers and couriers and it does not typically carry out long term investigations that result in the arrest of major drug traffickers . 
For example , [ORG GOG  ] contacts in both the police Service and the President , s office have said they know the identities of the major barons , but they have not said why they have not chosen to arrest them . 
A Police Service contact told us the [ORG GOG  ] does not have the political will to go after the barons . 
This official and other others close to the President have also told us that they cannot trust anyone when it comes to narcotics . 
Corruption is endemic in [LOC Ghana  ] and pervades all aspects of society . 
Although difficult to measure , corruption almost certainly impacts the law enforcement organizations charged with counternarcotics efforts . 
Post knows of no high level [ORG GOG  ] officials actively involved in the narcotics trade . 
Specific Law Enforcement Efforts -------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Some law enforcement officers are specifically dedicated to counternarcotics . 
[ORG NACOB  ] is the lead agency on narcotics , however , as stated above , scandals over the past two years have severely hindered its ability to perform its charge effectively . 
[ORG NACOB  ] has also been without an Operations Chief for nearly a year , although one was finally named in June and he was immediately sent to [LOC Germany  ] for several months of training . 
As a result of the scandals at [ORG NACOB  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] does not cooperate actively with [ORG NACOB  ] on individual cases . 
However , the [ORG USG  ] has trained [ORG NACOB  ] officials in the past through [ORG INL  ] funded [ORG DEA  ] classes . 
[ORG NACOB  ] is poorly resourced and , according to [MISC Ghanaian  ] law , must rely on the [LOC Ghana  ] Police to make arrests . 
For its part , the [LOC Ghana  ] Police has an [ORG Organized Crime Unit  ] which focuses on narcotics . 
The head of this unit is a close contact of the Embassy and has benefited from numerous trainings offered by the [ORG USG  ] . 
This unit showed its competency during the recent arrest of two [MISC Afghans  ] in a [ORG DEA  ] lead operation . 
The [MISC Afghans  ] were subsequently expelled from [LOC Ghana  ] and placed in [LOC U.S.  ] custody . 
They are now awaiting trial in the [LOC U.S.  ] Legal Framework for Counternarcotics Efforts -------------------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The legal framework in [LOC Ghana  ] is satisfactory , however implementation of the laws is lacking . 
Most recently , Parliament passed the long awaited anti-money laundering bill , but President [PER Kufuor  ] has yet to sign it into law . 
[LOC Ghana  ] does not have an asset forfeiture law , despite the fact that many [ORG GOG  ] officials have pleaded for one to be passed . 
[LOC Ghana  ] does have anti-corruption laws , however as with many laws , implementation is difficult and spotty . 
Another interesting facet of [MISC Ghanaian  ] law is that the [MISC Ghanaian  ] legal system does not have a plea bargain system . 
Small time couriers who are arrested therefore have no incentive to cooperate with law enforcement to lower their sentences . 
Extent of Overall [MISC Interdiction Capacity  ] at Ports --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [LOC Ghana  ] largely has little control over what flows through [ORG Kotoka International Airport  ] . 
The interdiction capacity the [ORG GOG  ] has at [ORG Kotoka International Airport  ] is [ORG ACCRA  ] 00002590 003.2 OF 003 largely carried out by the [LOC UK  ] through its [ORG Operation Westbridge  ] , which screens passengers and cargo . 
[ORG Westbridge  ] officials have noted that seizures drop off in [LOC Accra  ] and spike in [LOC London  ] when [LOC UK  ] officials are not present at [LOC Kotoka  ] . 
These same officials complain that [ORG NACOB  ] rotates the officers too quickly , preventing them from developing the expertise necessary to identify couriers and spot concealed narcotics . 
[LOC UK  ] officials have also suggested that some [ORG NACOB  ] officers at the airport have assisted couriers through the airport , although they are unable to prove their allegations . 
See ref C for a detailed description of [ORG Operation Westbridge  ] and its operations at [ORG Kotoka International Airport.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Despite some progress on screening passengers and cargo exiting [LOC Ghana  ] , little to no progress has been made to screen passengers and cargo entering [LOC Ghana  ] via air . 
[LOC Ghana  ] , s long seacoast is largely unpatrolled and is easily exploited . 
The [LOC Ghana  ] Navy does not have the capacity to patrol the coastline effectively and has asked for assistance in this realm . 
Furthermore , the [ORG GOG  ] lacks proper evidence lockers to account for and protect evidence . 
In 2005 for example , cocaine went missing from [ORG NACOB  ] , s &evidence room , 8 kicking off a firestorm of controversy .
