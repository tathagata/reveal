REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: Representatives of the [ORG Sudan Liberation Army/Unity  ] ( [ORG SLA/U  ] ) faction resident in [LOC Tripoli  ] view the March 15 " [PER Charter  ] of [LOC Tripoli  ] " as a key step to folding smaller rebel factions into the [ORG SLA/U  ] chain of command . 
In their view , the biggest gain is a consolidation of military assets and civilian support networks . 
Despite recent calls from the [ORG GOL  ] to participate in the [LOC Doha  ] process , they remain distrustful of [MISC Qatari  ] intervention and discount [MISC UN/AU  ] mediator [PER Djibril Bossole  ] 's ability to serve as an unbiased facilitator due to his " friendship " with [ORG Justice  ] and [ORG Equality Movement  ] ( [ORG JEM  ] ) leader [PER Khalil Ibrahim  ] . 
[LOC Libya  ] will help the new " [ORG Unity Plus  ] " organize meetings with [MISC Darfuri  ] civil society and camp leaders in [LOC Tripoli  ] over the week of March 22 , after which time [ORG SLA  ] will determine whether to take the fight back to the field or participate in the peace process . 
End summary . 
" CHARTER OF [LOC TRIPOLI  ] " UNITES GROUPS BUT DOESN'T MEAN THEY WILL GO TO [ORG DOHA  ] 2 . 
( C ) In a March 21 meeting with Poloff in their room at the [LOC GOL-owned Hotel  ] Kabiir , [ORG SLA/U  ] representatives - [PER Osman Busra  ] , [PER Saayid Sharif  ] , and [MISC London-based  ] [PER Mahjoub Hussein  ] - described the two-week-long conference in [LOC Tripoli  ] attended by [ORG SLA/U  ] , [PER SLA/Khamis  ] , [PER URF  ] , [PER JEM/Idris Azraq  ] , and [PER SLA/Juba  ] as an [ORG SLA/U  ] initiative facilitated by [MISC Libyan  ] hosts ( ref A ) . 
The main point was to unite the factions to strengthen their military and negotiating positions , but , contrary to the [MISC Qatari  ] readout ( ref B ) , they stressed that they had made no commitment to negotiate with the [ORG GOS  ] in [LOC Doha  ] " or in any other place " . 
Saying , " we will destroy [PER Khalil  ] , " [PER Sharif  ] viewed unification as a chance to show the [MISC Darfurian  ] people and the international community that [ORG SLA/U  ] is the only " real movement " . 
Deriding [PER Ibrahim  ] as an [MISC Islamist  ] who had no support from the [MISC Darfurian  ] people , [PER Sharif  ] assessed the importance placed on him by the [MISC Qataris  ] and other international actors is due to a combination of media spotlight from [MISC Arab  ] press like al-Jazeera and that " [PER Khalil  ] , the regime and [PER Turabi  ] are all playing together [ on the same team ] because they are [MISC Muslim  ] brothers " . 
3 . 
( C ) While leaving open the possibility of joining future talks in [LOC Doha  ] , [ORG SLA/U  ] views [MISC Qatari  ] Minister of State al-Mahmoud as uninformed of the real situation on the ground . 
Citing al-Mahmoud 's trips to [LOC Chad  ] and [LOC Darfur  ] where he met with [ORG JEM  ] but not [ORG SLA/U  ] , [PER Sharif  ] claimed he has been poorly guided by [MISC UN/AU  ] mediator [PER Djibirl Bossole  ] . 
Al-Mahmoud 's presence at the signing of the " [PER Charter  ] of [LOC Tripoli  ] " helped him learn more , but [PER Busra  ] still found his credibility in doubt saying , " if a man swears by [PER Allah  ] too much , he is a liar " . 
[PER Bossole  ] , they claim , is biased toward [PER Khalil Ibrahim  ] and has lost credibility with other factions by focusing on [ORG JEM  ] and ignoring movements that have support of [LOC Darfur  ] 's internally displaced people . 
Dismissing the framework agreement signed between [ORG JEM  ] and the [ORG GOS  ] in February , [PER Hussein  ] noted that " an agreement without the support of the people is a big zero " . 
[ORG LIBYA  ] ALLOWING [ORG SLA/U  ] MORE FREEDOM WHILE PUSHING FOR [ORG DOHA  ] 4 . 
( C ) All three representatives agreed that [LOC Libya  ] 's position on [LOC Darfur  ] had changed since al-Qadhafi became Chairman of the [ORG African Union  ] . 
Previously they enjoyed sanctuary in [LOC Tripoli  ] but were forbidden from talking to the press . 
In the past month , however , they have given interviews to [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi 's [MISC Oya  ] newspaper , al-Shababiya radio station , and al-Libya satellite channel . 
The biggest shift has been [LOC Libya  ] 's support of [LOC Doha  ] as a venue for discussions . 
After quietly dismissing [MISC Qatari  ] intervention from November 2008 to late February , [MISC Libyan  ] officials began urging [ORG SLA/U  ] to engage in the [LOC Doha  ] process in early March . 
( Note: [MISC Qatari  ] [PER Emir Hamad  ] visited [LOC Tripoli  ] on March 5 . 
End note ) . 
Despite [LOC Libya  ] 's new-found support for the [MISC Qatari  ] initiative , [PER Busra  ] said [LOC Libya  ] was a better venue for talks as field commanders and members of civil society could travel by car and there would be no chance of losing contact with military elements of the movement . 
5 . 
( C ) [LOC Libya  ] has also played the gracious host , allowing [ORG SLA/U  ] to invite the groups to [LOC Tripoli  ] with minimal [ORG GOL  ] interference ( [PER Busra  ] claimed that al-Mahmoud and [MISC Libyan  ] FM [PER Musa Kusa  ] attended only the signing ceremony ) . 
They are also providing transportation and lodging for a number of [MISC Darfurian  ] civil society members , IDP camp leaders , and military council supporters of the five joined movements to come to [LOC Tripoli  ] [MISC TRIPOLI  ] 00000249 002.2 OF 002 during the week of March 23 to decide on a name for the combined movement , appoint a leader , and decide whether to participate in a second [LOC Doha  ] round of talks . 
However , [PER Sharif  ] said a cease fire would only be possible if the [ORG GOS  ] met three conditions: immediately reverse the decision to expel [ORG NGOs  ] from [LOC Darfur  ] , allow no-fly zones over [LOC Sudan  ] , and release all prisoners ( military and civilian ) that are members of the combined [ORG SLA  ] movement . 
6 . 
( C//NF ) Comment: While all three representatives consider the March 15 " [PER Charter  ] of [LOC Tripoli  ] " as significant , they seemed certain that they would not be going to [LOC Doha  ] any time soon . 
They were much more interested in consolidating their gains: they claim continued success in bringing individual military commanders previously aligned with leaders like [PER Minni Minnawi  ] and [PER Abdul Wahid Nur  ] into their organization and are proud that their fighters stay in [LOC Darfur  ] " with the support of the [MISC Darfurian  ] people " . 
In our meetings , they were nakedly attempting to win greater recognition for their movement and seem jealous of the attention paid to [PER Minni Minnawi  ] , [PER Abdul Wahid  ] , and [PER Khalil Ibrahim  ] by [LOC Darfur  ] watchers . 
They spoke at length about their democratic institutions and support from the people while dismissing other leaders as autocrats intent on replacing the Bashir regime with their own - perhaps a gambit to win USG support for their movement .
