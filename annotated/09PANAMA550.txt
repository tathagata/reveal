2009 [ORG PANAMA  ] 539 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Stephenson  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) During a morning of high political theater , President [PER Martinelli  ] , [LOC Panama  ] 's senior government officials , consortia representatives , diplomatic corps , and the public ( through live TV and an internet broadcast ) witnessed the presentation of the technical scores and the opening of the financial bids on July 8 . 
After brief real-time calculations , the [ORG Panama Canal Authority  ] ( [ORG ACP  ] ) announced that [ORG Sacyr  ] 's consortium won the bid to build the third set of locks , centerpiece of the $5.25 billion [ORG Panama Canal Expansion  ] . 
[ORG Bechtel  ] believes [ORG Sacyr  ] broke [ORG EU  ] anti-competiveness laws in obtaining its surety bonds and will protest if they find a smoking gun . 
The [ORG Sacyr  ] win signals expanding [MISC Spanish  ] influence in [LOC Panama  ] and a potential loss of [MISC American  ] export opportunities for the project ( although much of the sourcing has not yet been determined ) . ---------- [ORG SACYR  ] WINS ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) President [PER Martinelli  ] , [LOC Panama  ] 's senior government and [ORG ACP  ] officials , consortia representatives , diplomatic corps members , and the public ( through live TV and an internet broadcast ) witnessed the awarding of the locks contract , the centerpiece of the $5.25 billion [ORG Panama Canal Expansion  ] , to a consortium led by [ORG Sacyr Vallehermoso S.A.  ] . 
The other consortia members are [PER Impregilo S.P.A  ] . 
( [MISC Italian  ] ) , [PER Jan de Nul N.V  ] . 
( [MISC Belgian  ] ) , [PER Constructora Urbana  ] , [ORG S.A  ] . 
( [MISC Panamanian  ] and run by the first cousin of the [ORG Panama Canal  ] Administrator ) , [PER Montgomery Watson Harza  ] ( [MISC American  ] ) , [PER IV-Groep  ] ( [MISC Dutch  ] ) , [PER Tetra Tech  ] ( [MISC American  ] ) , and [ORG Heerema Fabrication Group  ] ( [MISC Dutch  ] ) . --------------------------------- PROCESS FOR DETERMINING [ORG SACYR  ] WON --------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG ACP  ] declared [ORG Sacyr  ] to have the " best value " proposal . 
Out of a possible 10,000 points , [ORG Sacyr  ] obtained a dominating 8089 points ; [ORG Bechtel  ] - 6770 points ; and ACS - 6559 points . 
The total point tally was composed from technical and financial scores . 
[ORG Sacyr  ] had the highest technical score with 4089 points ( out of a possible 5500 ) , ACS - 3974 points , and [ORG Bechtel  ] - 3790 points . 
The technical points ranking was " shocking " to a representative of [ORG CH2MHill  ] ( an [MISC American-firm  ] ) , the [ORG Project Advisor  ] for the expansion program . 
Previously , sources rated [ORG Bechtel  ] 's and ACS 's technical plans to be about equal and both superior to [ORG Sacyr  ] 's . 
See ref G . 
The pre-announcement conventional wisdom on the technical plans was so prevalent that the audience collectively gasped when the [ORG Sacyr  ] high technical score was announced . 
During a post-announcment meeting with the Ambassador , the subdued [ORG Bechtel  ] reps speculated that the technical scoring committee was probably not comfortable with [ORG Bechtel  ] 's " innovative " design , because it did not fit neatly into the [ORG ACP  ] 's specifications . 
[ORG Bechtel  ] reps dismissed challenging the technical evaluation process , noting from past experience that these technical evaluations can be highly subjective. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) After the award ceremony started , [ORG ACP  ] and consortia officials retrieved the price envelopes from a nearby bank vault . 
The audience watched via streaming video projected on to giant screens , the [MISC OJ Simpson-esque  ] drive to/from the bank and the " signing out " of the deposit box with the envelopes . 
The base price proposals were $3.1 billion for [ORG Sacyr  ] , $4.2 billion for [ORG Bechtel  ] , and $6.0 for ACS , which led to financial point scores of 4000 , 2980 , and 2586 , respectively . 
( The provisional prices were $103 million , $94 million , and $0 , respectively . 
) The [ORG Sacyr  ] base price elicited a cheer from the audience ; many [MISC Panamanians  ] are pleased that the locks may be built for less money than expected . 
[ORG Sacyr  ] supporters cheered , because their victory was almost assured with the best technical score and lowest price. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The spread on the bid prices is surprising . 
[ORG Sacyr  ] was expected to be the low ball bid ( due to its precarious financial situation and apparent financial backstop from the [MISC Spanish  ] government ) , but both [ORG Bechtel  ] and [ORG ACS  ] reps had hinted to Embassy officials that their bids were just over $4 billion . 
See ref [PER G. However  ] , the base price proposals lined up with the three bidding strategies outlined in ref D - lowball , value , or punt . 
The fact that ACS 's $6 billion bid was almost double of [ORG Sacyr  ] 's was not expected and is interpreted by some as a punt . 
[ORG Bechtel  ] reps state a consortium cannot even " pour the concrete " for $3.1 billion and hinted even their $4.2 billion price was closer to a lowball bid than a value bid . 
It is widely expected that during construction , [ORG Sacyr  ] will attempt to renegotiate the price with the [LOC ACP.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) After the [ORG ACP  ] declared [ORG Sacyr  ] the " best value " winner , the [ORG ACP  ] opened the sealed envelope with the price ceiling ( la partida asignada ) for the contract . 
[ORG Sacyr  ] offered a base price below the [ORG ACP  ] 's $3.5 billion ceiling ; as a result , further negotiation on price between the [ORG ACP  ] and [ORG Sacyr  ] is not needed . 
See ref [PER G.  ] ------------------------------- NEXT STEPS IN THE AWARD PROCESS ------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The [ORG ACP  ] Price [ORG Verification Board  ] will now verify that the process complies with [ORG ACP  ] requirements and the [ORG ACP  ] Contracting Officer will proceed to verify the contractor 's qualifications . 
Both these steps should be pro forma , and the [ORG ACP  ] expects to officially award the contract in a few business days . 
Upon announcement of the award , the [ORG ACP  ] will notify all consortia members and allow the evaluation documents to be examined by all consortia . 
The winning consortium must renew its surety bonds within twenty-eight days . 
The losing consortia have three days to protest , once the five day notification period expires . 
The [ORG ACP Procurement Division  ] must then adjudicate a protest within thirty days . 
Whether or not the losing consortia agree with the [ORG ACP  ] decision , the [ORG ACP  ] will proceed to sign the contract with [ORG Sacyr  ] . 
Without defining " work , " the [ORG ACP  ] requires [ORG Sacyr  ] to begin work seven days after the contract signing. ---------------- [ORG BECHTEL  ] PROTEST ? ---------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG Bechtel  ] reps informed the Ambassador that at this time they only plan to protest the award if they can prove that [ORG Sacyr  ] 's $400 million performance and $50 million payment bonds ( that must now by renewed from [LOC Zurich  ] ) are counter-guaranteed by a [MISC European  ] government and undisclosed . 
If the bonds are counter-guaranteed , then [ORG Bechtel  ] reps believe [ORG Sacyr  ] and the backing [MISC European  ] government ( s ) ( probably [LOC Spain  ] ) broke [ORG European Union  ] anti-competitiveness laws by not having this state aid declared . 
If true and if the potential remedy is significant , [ORG Bechtel  ] might pursue the matter in court . 
However , counter-guaranteed surety bonds are not against the [ORG ACP  ] bid rules . 
See ref H for background on this issue . 
However , we can not rule out some other type of [MISC Spanish  ] government guarantee was provided to [ORG Sacyr  ] ( outside of the specific action of guaranteeing surety bonds ) that would enable [ORG Sacyr  ] access to the credit necessary to complete the project , preserve [MISC Spanish  ] jobs , and prevent a rumored shock to [MISC Spanish  ] banking system that could ensue from a collapse of [LOC Sacyr.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG Bechtel  ] reps were not alarmed over past press leaks from [ORG Impregilo  ] of the [ORG Sacyr  ] consortium forecasting [ORG Sacyr  ] 's highest technical score and lowest price . 
They believe the leaks likely did not reflect undue access to inside information or skullduggery by the [ORG ACP  ] . 
See ref [PER G. Rather  ] , the [ORG Bechtel  ] rep opined , it was far more likely that [ORG Impregilo  ] was engaging in puffery on the outcome in order to secure vital new credit. ------------------- [MISC PANAMANIAN  ] REACTION ------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Overall , the [ORG ACP  ] , President [PER Martinelli  ] , and the [MISC Panamanian  ] public are clearly ecstatic about receiving a prima facie bargain basement price and that a [MISC Panamanian  ] company ( [ORG CUSA  ] ) is part of the [ORG Sacyr  ] consortium . 
However , we understand there may be lingering doubts by some [ORG ACP Board Members  ] and members of the government that the [ORG Sacyr  ] consortium does not have financial ability to complete the project . 
[ORG Bechtel  ] reported they had been called to a surprise meeting with [MISC VP/FM  ] [PER Juan Carlos Varela  ] , who was clearly concerned about the big price spread and suggested the cabinet needed to ask [ORG ACP  ] Administrator [PER Aleman  ] to provide an explanation. ------------------------ CANAL EXPANSION OVERVIEW ------------------------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The [MISC Panamanian  ] people approved the overall [LOC Panama  ] Canal Expansion project on October 22 , 2006 in a [ORG National Referendum  ] and the [ORG ACP  ] broke ground on the first related excavation project on September 3 , 2007 . 
The expansion consists of three major components: construction of the locks , widening and deepening of the navigational channels , and deepening [LOC Lake Gatun  ] . 
Of the various major contracts to complete the expansion , there is now only one left - the estimated $400 million [ORG PAC  ] 4 excavation that includes the building of a dam . 
The [ORG ACP  ] hopes to complete the expansion in 2014 for the 100th anniversary of the opening of the [LOC Panama  ] Canal . 
Whether the expansion is completed on-time and on-budget may impact the 2014 [MISC Panamanian  ] Presidential and [ORG National Assembly  ] elections. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [LOC U.S.  ] ECONOMIC IMPACT: [ORG Bechtel  ] was expected to purchase $1.2 to $1.3 billion dollars worth of goods from [LOC U.S.  ] suppliers . 
[ORG Sacyr  ] has not provided post with their expected [LOC U.S.  ] purchases ; however , due to [ORG Sacyr  ] 's close relationship with [MISC European  ] suppliers , the amount of [LOC U.S.  ] exports could be substantially affected . 
[MISC American  ] companies [PER Montgomery Watson Harza  ] ( [ORG MWH  ] ) and [ORG Tetra Tech  ] are minor partners in [ORG Sacyr  ] 's consortium ; [ORG MWH  ] and [ORG Tetra Tech  ] have not requested commercial advocacy. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) LONG TERM: For over a hundred years , the [LOC Panama  ] Canal remained at the core of the [ORG United States/Panamanian  ] relationship . 
Two-thirds of all ships transiting the canal are traveling to/from a [LOC U.S.  ] port and we retain a fundamental interest in the successful completion of the expansion project . 
However , the [ORG Sacyr  ] win marks an increased tide of [MISC Spanish  ] influence in [LOC Panama  ] and - for now - injects an element of uncertainty in to the future of the canal expansion . 
What is undisputed , is the pride of [MISC Panamanian  ] officials in moving this project forward under their sovereignty .
