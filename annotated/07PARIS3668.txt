( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [ORG Summary:  ] The [ORG GOF  ] took a hard line during an August 23 trip to [LOC Tehran  ] by [MISC French  ] presidency strategic affairs adviser [PER Richier  ] and [MISC French  ] MFA DAS-equivalent [PER Gellet  ] that [MISC Iranian  ] leader [ORG Khamanei  ] 's foreign policy adviser [PER Velayati  ] hoped would open a new channel to [LOC Paris  ] . 
[PER Gellet  ] explained August 31 that [PER Velayati  ] was apparently operating from a flawed premise that [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] would free [LOC France  ] from its " dependence " on the [ORG USG  ] . 
[PER Velayati  ] further believed [LOC France  ] could be broken away from the P-5 over further sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Gellet  ] said [PER Richier  ] previewed for [PER Velayati  ] the line [PER Sarkozy  ] would use in a subsequent speech to [MISC French  ] ambassadors that the world faced a " catastrophic " choice between [LOC Iran  ] with a bomb or bombing [LOC Iran  ] . 
Although [PER Velayati  ] 's hopes were shattered , [LOC Iran  ] is still interested in the channel ; [PER Gellet  ] said that [PER Richier  ] has the lead in deciding what the [ORG GOF  ] will do next . 
[PER Gellet  ] expressed a strong [MISC French  ] desire to remain informed on [LOC U.S.  ] plans regarding [LOC Iran  ] particularly should we decide to take military action against [LOC Iran  ] . 
End summary <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC French  ] MFA DAS-equivalent for [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , and the [MISC Gulf  ] [PER Franck Gellet  ] on August 31 provided a readout on his August 23 visit to [LOC Tehran  ] accompanying the [MISC French  ] presidency 's strategic affairs adviser [PER Francois Richier  ] . 
The visit followed an invitation from [PER Ali Akbar Velayati  ] , former [MISC Iranian  ] foreign minister and current foreign affairs adviser to Supreme Leader [ORG Khamanei  ] . 
[PER Gellet  ] confirmed information that the [MISC French  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Washington  ] communicated to the Department that [PER Velayati  ] wanted to establish a new direct channel to [LOC Paris  ] . 
[PER Gellet  ] elaborated that [PER Velayati  ] 's ( apparently convoluted ) thinking had been expressed in an article he had written that took the view that the election of [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] gave [LOC France  ] a chance to break free of its " dependence " on the [LOC U.S.  ] in terms of its foreign policy . 
[PER Velayati  ] , according to [PER Gellet  ] , believed that [MISC Chirac  ] had been entirely beholden to the [LOC U.S.  ] during his presidency . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] 's election , therefore , offered [LOC Iran  ] a chance to appeal to [LOC France  ] in a way that would allow [LOC France  ] to follow its independent line a la [PER de Gaulle  ] and thus pry [LOC France  ] loose from the coalition that now sought to impose tougher sanctions on [LOC Iran  ] over its nuclear program. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Despite this clearly flawed analysis of [LOC France  ] 's position and political dynamics , the [ORG GOF  ] decided this opening was important enough to explore . 
[PER Gellet  ] recounted how he and [PER Richier  ] met [PER Velayati  ] , heard him out , and proceeded to burst his bubble . 
[PER Richier  ] , according to [PER Gellet  ] , told [PER Velayati  ] that [PER Sarkozy  ] was firm on the nuclear issue and previewed for him the line that [PER Sarkozy  ] would use in his August 29 speech to [MISC French  ] ambassadors that under current circumstances the world faced the stark alternative that [LOC Iran  ] would obtain " the bomb " or be bombed . 
[PER Velayati  ] was not happy to hear this but did not close the door to further discussion . 
[PER Gellet  ] surmised that [PER Velayati  ] believes the [MISC French  ] are still susceptible to [MISC Iranian  ] blandishments and wants to keep some sort of alternative line open to the [LOC Elysee.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Gellet  ] stressed that [PER Velayati  ] 's initiative was not taken without reference to others in the [MISC Iranian  ] government . 
[MISC Iranian  ] Deputy Foreign Minister for Legal and [ORG International Affairs Abbas Araghchi  ] sat in on the [PER Velayati  ] meeting just as [PER Velayati  ] attended a meeting [PER Gellet  ] and [PER Richier  ] had with [ORG Araghchi  ] . 
[PER Gellet  ] did not indicate what other subjects came up , but [PER Velayati  ] 's pitch was the main one . 
When asked whether [LOC France  ] felt the visit had been worthwhile and what sort of follow-up there might be , [PER Gellet  ] was vague . 
He said that [PER Richier  ] , in his [PER Elyse capacity  ] , would decide what to do , including whether to keep this dialogue going . 
[PER Gellet  ] surmised that [PER Richier  ] would be willing to discuss this further with [ORG USG  ] officials , like [ORG PM A/S  ] Rood , in future meetings to discuss next steps in the nuclear fuel dispute. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Gellet  ] found the visit a bit surreal but quite indicative of the bizarre way [LOC Iran  ] functions . 
He noted the diffusion of power among different entities and the uncertainty that pervades [MISC Iranian  ] decision making . 
[PER Velayati  ] clearly sought to minimize or counterbalance President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] 's hard line but without actually taking a softer line himself . 
[LOC Iran  ] 's core position , therefore , did not seem to be shifting or subject to any flexibility . 
When asked how [LOC France  ] understood [PER Sarkozy  ] 's either/or statement on [LOC Iran  ] had played in that country , [PER Gellet  ] replied that [MISC Iranian  ] authorities seem to have largely kept it out of the national media . 
The implication that [LOC France  ] sees [LOC Iran  ] facing a serious risk of military retaliation over its stance was thus largely unreported . 
[PER Gellet  ] argued that this suits [PER Velayati  ] 's calculations because the impression remains that [LOC Iran  ] can [LOC PARIS  ] 00003668 002 OF 002 somehow turn to [LOC France  ] to blunt [MISC American  ] pressure to impose more sanctions and escalate the situation. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) On the issue of escalation , [PER Gellet  ] asked that the [ORG USG  ] keep [LOC France  ] informed of its thinking as regards possible military action against [LOC Iran  ] . 
He claimed that the Elysee worries about being blindsided if or when the time comes for a strike . 
The timing and magnitude of such action , i.e. , a surgical strike or a more generalized campaign , could have enormous stakes in terms of [MISC French  ] interests . 
[PER Gellet  ] noted , in this vein , [MISC French  ] concerns about [MISC Iranian  ] retaliation against the [MISC Gulf States  ] and their capacity to respond . 
He surmised that a U.S./France dialogue , if it were to develop , might occur at a much higher level than his . 
His hope , which was personal as much as he said it reflected official thinking , was that we would keep the [MISC French  ] in the loop as we moved into the next phase of high-tension diplomacy focused on further [ORG UNSC  ] sanctions. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment: It appears that this latest [MISC Iranian  ] initiative to open a new channel to [LOC Paris  ] is unlikely to change the dynamics of [LOC Tehran  ] 's ongoing confrontation with the world . 
The [MISC French  ] seem keen to reassure us that they are not wavering . 
President [PER Sarkozy  ] 's tough words to the [MISC French  ] Ambassadors conference following the meetings in [LOC Tehran  ] made that point loud and clear . 
On whether to engage more intensively with the [MISC French  ] about the various contingencies related to [LOC Iran  ] , we believe we should continue to test [PER Sarkozy  ] 's apparent desire to deal with us differently than his predecessors did . 
As an indication of different [MISC French  ] thinking , the newspaper " [ORG Le Monde  ] " reported active discussion in the Elysee of sanctions targeting [LOC Iran  ] outside the [ORG UNSC  ] that [LOC France  ] could impose alone or potentially with others in the [ORG EU  ] . 
The article made clear that , as " fissures " seem to be appearing among the P-5 over [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC France  ] seems to be toughening its position . 
We will follow up with [PER Richier  ] for his take on this visit .
