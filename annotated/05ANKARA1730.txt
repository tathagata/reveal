[LOC ANKARA  ] 1102 ( U ) Classified by [ORG CDA Robert Deutsch  ] ; E.O. 12958 , reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: [LOC Turkey  ] is stuck in a domestic and foreign policy drift stemming from leadership and structural problems in ruling [ORG AKP  ] . 
A long-overdue healthy debate over [LOC Turkey  ] 's identity and [ORG AKP  ] , including its handling of relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] , has started . 
But [ORG AKP  ] 's policy muddle is leaving a vacuum that resurgent nationalism is seeking to fill . 
This period of drift could be extended , making [ORG EU  ] reforms and bilateral cooperation more difficult . 
The drift may well continue until the next crisis creates new political alternatives in a day of reckoning . 
End Summary . 
[ORG AKP Government Adrift  ] ----------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) As the [ORG AKP  ] government confronts the arduous task of [ORG EU  ] harmonization , it is manifestly adrift on domestic political and economic reform . 
Implementation of reform legislation passed in 2003-2004 is seriously deficient ( refs A and B ) . 
The [ORG AKP  ] government has a poor working relationship with the military , the Presidency and the largely-secular state bureaucracy . 
It is failing to control corruption in the [ORG AK  ] party . 
It has been slow to introduce the banking , tax administration and social security legislation required by the [ORG IMF  ] as a pre-condition for a new stand-by program . 
It is neglecting relations with the [ORG EU  ] . 
[PER Erdogan  ] has delayed appointing a chief negotiator for [ORG EU  ] accession negotiations ; both [PER Erdogan  ] and FM [PER Gul  ] have made statements which have disturbed [ORG EU  ] officials and politicians . 
[PER Erdogan  ] has still not decided on a much-anticipated cabinet reshuffle. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG AK  ] party officials publicly deny the government 's obvious drift and we see no sign it has yet begun to undermine [PER Erdogan  ] 's voter base . 
[ORG AKP  ] 's ability to get back on track is compromised by its [MISC Islamist/neo-Ottoman  ] reflexes and single-party-state spoils system . 
We doubt this government will be able to refocus or move our bilateral relationship – which remains strong in some areas – back to a more strategic level. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) PM [PER Erdogan  ] is isolated . 
He has lost touch with his Cabinet and parliamentary group . 
We hear MPs and Ministers alike , xxxxx who is close to [PER Erdogan  ] , complain they no longer have comfortable access , or feel obliged to kowtow for fear of incurring [PER Erdogan  ] 's wrath . 
Business associations , strong advocates of [ORG AKP  ] economic policies , tell us they feel they have lost the PM 's ear . 
[PER Erdogan  ] has cut himself off from his closest spiritual advisors in the Iskender [PER Pasa Naksibendi  ] brotherhood in which he grew up , as we have heard directly from xxxxx. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) According to a broad range of our contacts , [PER Erdogan  ] reads minimally , mainly the [MISC Islamist-leaning  ] press . 
According to others with broad and deep contacts throughout the establishment , [PER Erdogan  ] refuses to draw on the analyses of the [ORG MFA  ] , and the military and [ORG National Intelligence Organization  ] have cut him off from their reports . 
He never had a realistic world view , but one key touchstone is a fear of being outmaneuvered on the [MISC Islamist  ] side by “Hoca” [ORG Erbakan  ] 's [ORG Saadet Party  ] . 
Instead , he relies on his charisma , instincts , and the filterings of advisors who pull conspiracy theories off the Web or are lost in neo-Ottoman [MISC Islamist  ] fantasies , e.g. , [MISC Islamist  ] foreign policy advisor and [PER Gul  ] ally [PER Ahmet Davutoglu.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Inside the [ORG AKP  ] , the more ideological Deputy [PER PM/FonMin Gul  ] continues behind-the-scenes machinations , especially during [PER Erdogan  ] 's foreign junkets . 
[PER Gul  ] seems to be trying to undermine [PER Erdogan  ] and take on more party control . 
He may hope to reclaim the Prime Ministership , which he was forced to cede to [PER Erdogan  ] four months after [ORG AKP  ] acceded to power . 
With his relatively good [MISC English  ] , [PER Gul  ] works to project an image of being “moderate” , or “modern” . 
In fact , [PER Gul  ] 's peers say he has a far more ideologized anti-Western worldview than [PER Erdogan  ] . 
[PER Gul  ] , reflecting his pragmatic streak , has made some constructive statements on bilateral relations and on [LOC Turkey  ] 's [LOC Iraq  ] policy since the [MISC Iraqi  ] elections . 
However , we understand that [PER Gul  ] and a group of like-minded MPs and journalists continue to see fomenting anti-American attitudes as one way to get at [PER Erdogan  ] while also being moved by emotions of [LOC Islamic/Sunni  ] solidarity. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG AKP  ] 's disarray has generated significant internal unease from those who support [PER Erdogan  ] , but also from some of the other tendencies forming [LOC AK.  ] xxxxx that [PER Erdogan  ] does not know how to proceed , either on domestic policy or on rebuilding relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] xxxxx , a bellwether of [MISC Islamist  ] sentiment , has told two of our insider contacts that he is about to resign in disgust at the party 's rampant corruption. xxxxx one of [PER Erdogan  ] 's closest business and brotherhood friends and advisors from [LOC Istanbul  ] , says he sees no future for this government and thinks it is time for a more flexible and open leader . 
Leading member xxxxx has expressed to us the Gulenists' sense that [PER Erdogan  ] cannot hack it . 
Long Overdue Healthy Debate ----------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The ferment is not all bad . 
It is beginning to force some to question the real roots of inertia and stasis in a [LOC Turkey  ] that needs to accelerate its transition . 
We are encouraged by the determination of some to open a long-overdue , healthy debate on [ORG AKP  ] and its handling of [LOC Turkey  ] 's relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] Secretary Rice 's February 6 visit and subsequent [LOC U.S.  ] media coverage helped ignite the debate . 
Another catalyst was Deputy [PER CHOD Basbug  ] 's January 26 press briefing , in which he coolly analyzed [MISC Turkish  ] concerns about [LOC Iraq  ] and repeatedly emphasized that one cannot reduce broad and comprehensive [MISC U.S.-Turkish  ] relations to a single issue . 
It was not until late February , that [PER Erdogan  ] – albeit without conviction in his voice – expressed anything similar to [PER Basbug  ] 's assessment of the importance of bilateral relations. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The debate has now produced some sustained trenchant criticism of [ORG AKP  ] 's domestic and foreign policies from several insightful mainstream commentators . 
However , mainstream commentators are seen as too “pro-American” to be persuasive among [ORG AKP  ] or its supporters . 
Perhaps more important have been the decisions of some pro-AKP [MISC Islamist  ] columnists to write unusually blunt warnings that the [ORG AKP  ] government must pull itself together or risk a fall . 
The Parliamentary opposition has continued its anti-American 60 's leftist rhetoric as it winds its merry way to irrelevance . 
Resurgent Nationalism ---------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) There is a more disturbing consequence of [ORG AKP  ] 's weakness: resurgent nationalism . 
Two of the hottest selling books in [LOC Turkey  ] are “Metal Storm” , a conspiracy novel that feeds the worst instincts of [LOC Turks  ] with its tale of a [LOC U.S.  ] invasion of [LOC Turkey  ] followed by [MISC Turkish  ] nuclear counter-strike with the help of the [MISC Russians  ] ; and “Mein [MISC Kampf”  ] ( ref C ) . 
Under instructions from the [ORG Directorate of Religious Affairs  ] , imams across [LOC Turkey  ] delivered a March 11 sermon against [MISC Christian  ] missionaries ( ref D ) , claiming they aim to “steal the beliefs of our young people and children.” We are receiving increased reports of anti-Christian activity in different regions of [LOC Turkey  ] ( e.g. , ref E ) . 
The [ORG Central Bank Governor  ] told us that nationalist/isolationist forces are behind the problems with the [ORG IMF  ] ( ref F ) . 
An attempt to burn the [MISC Turkish  ] flag during a [MISC Newroz  ] celebration in [LOC Mersin  ] has drawn strong nationalistic statements from across the spectrum , including a statement from the General Staff that “the [MISC Turkish  ] nation and the [MISC Turkish  ] armed forces are ready to sacrifice their blood to protect their country and their flag.” The decision to memorialize , after a 47-year hiatus , the killing by [MISC British  ] forces of several [MISC Ottoman  ] soldiers during the [MISC Allies' W.W.I  ] occupation of [LOC Istanbul  ] also bespeaks the national mood. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) The [MISC Turkish  ] media have given prominent coverage to what appears to be a growth in street crime and to a parallel refusal of the police , angry at limitations on their operational abilities under the new [MISC EU-inspired  ] criminal code , to patrol aggressively . 
In a March 18 column , [PER Ertugrul Ozkok  ] , managing editor of [LOC Turkey  ] 's leading newspaper “Hurriyet” and one of the most authoritative press voices of the [ORG Establishment  ] , noted that the [MISC Turkish  ] public is deeply disturbed by what it perceives as a breakdown of law and order . 
[PER Ozkok  ] , in what would appear to be an overstatement , closed with a warning to [PER Erdogan  ] that , when democratic forces cannot ensure safety in the streets ( sic ) , then the public and political space is left to other forces . 
In a March 4 column , [PER Umit Ozdag  ] , now in the running for chairmanship of the right-wing nationalist MHP , cited increased crime as one reason for the current popularity of “Mein Kampf.” <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Resurgent nationalist feelings probably also played a role in the press and government reactions to comments from [ORG EU  ] Ambassador [PER Kretschmer  ] about the government 's loss of momentum and [ORG EU  ] accession , to the [ORG EU  ] Troika 's worry about the police violence against a March 6 [LOC Istanbul  ] demonstration , and the press feeding frenzy over Ambassador [PER Edelman  ] 's innocent remarks on [LOC Syria  ] . 
Comment ------ <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Having reached one of its primary goals – a date to begin [ORG EU  ] accession negotiations – [PER Erdogan  ] 's [ORG AKP  ] government is out of ideas and energy . 
For now , [ORG EU-  ] and IMF-required reforms will face tougher opposition from re-energized nationalists , the government will be tempted to delay difficult decisions in any realm , and resistance to change will be the default mode . 
Bilateral cooperation will be more difficult , more vulnerable to characterization as unreasonable [LOC U.S.  ] “demands” that infringe upon [MISC Turkish  ] “sovereignty.” <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) This period of drift could last a long time . 
[ORG AKP  ] 's Parliamentary majority is eroding , but only slowly ( ref G ) . 
Despite the unhappiness inside [ORG AKP  ] , there is currently no political alternative and there are risks to anyone who actually forces a split . 
[PER Erdogan  ] still has a “nuclear” option in hand – early elections . 
The danger is that tough decisions and the settling out of the political system will be put off until a real new crisis emerges which will either energize the [ORG AKP  ] or bring new political alternatives . 
Waiting bears a real cost , since [LOC Turkey  ] needs to be more nimble in pursuing the political , economic , social and foreign policy agendas many [LOC Turks  ] , the [ORG EU  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] , have been supporting , than this type of static drift will permit .
