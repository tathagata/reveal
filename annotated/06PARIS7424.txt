( C ) SUMMARY: [PER Segolene Royal  ] 's overwhelming first-round victory in the November 16 [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PS  ] ) presidential primary makes it official -- she will be the candidate of the center-left in next year 's presidential election , likely in a tight race against the center-right 's [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] . 
The win is a testament to [PER Royal  ] 's ability to confound [LOC France  ] 's purveyors of conventional political wisdom and her own party establishment . 
Both regularly underestimated her and discounted her ability to go the distance . 
[PER Royal  ] 's success has been her ability -- as a [MISC Blair-like  ] socialist -- to deal with issues non-ideologically through the prism of their impact on ordinary people , with a focus on concrete , operational proposals that she is willing to jettison if they prove unworkable. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) SUMMARY CONT . 
[PER Royal  ] has demonstrated these same traits in the foreign affairs arena , where her recent statements in support of the democratic government in [LOC Iraq  ] and against even a civilian nuclear program in [LOC Iran  ] were met with condescension by elites , but seem not to have hurt her with [ORG PS  ] voters . 
If she were to be elected President , we would expect criticism of [LOC U.S  ] . 
" unilateralism " , environmental policies , and more . 
But her years working in [ORG Mitterrand  ] 's Elysee also portend an openness to pragmatic cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] End Summary . 
THE PRIMARY ELECTION RESULTS ---------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) On November 16 , in an overwhelming vote of confidence in her ability to win , over 60 percent of [ORG PS  ] party members endorsed [PER Segolene Royal  ] as their party 's candidate in the 2007 presidential race . 
Of the 176,220 votes cast by [ORG PS  ] party members throughout metropolitan [LOC France  ] , [PER Royal  ] received 106,839 , former Finance Minister [PER Dominique Strauss-Kahn  ] , 36,714 former Prime Minister [PER Laurent Fabius  ] 32,667 . 
Ever since [PER Royal  ] launched her bid for the presidency , [LOC France  ] 's purveyors of conventional political wisdom have been discounting her ability to go the distance . 
[PER Royal  ] has proved them wrong each time . 
The [PER Sarkozy  ] camp now understands it will be facing a formidable opponent , whom they would underestimate at their own peril . 
Throughout the race , [PER Royal  ] displayed the energy , conviction , charisma , and physical stamina that have made her a leading contender to be elected [LOC France  ] 's next president . 
A FIFTY PERCENT CHANCE OF BEING FRANCE'S ---------------------------------------- NEXT PRESIDENT -------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Royal  ] 's clear-cut victory in the first-round of the [ORG PS  ] primary election confirms her as the unchallenged leader of the center-left in [LOC France  ] . 
It sets up a showdown between her and Interior Minister [PER Sarkozy  ] for [LOC France  ] 's presidency in <a id='par2007' href='#par2007'>¶</a>2007 . 
Analysts agree that if the dominance of the presidential field by these two major candidates holds , the second round run-off between them will be very , very close . 
Though the unexpected -- including major missteps by these leading candidates during their campaigns -- could still reconfigure the electoral landscape , dislodging one or the other becomes more and more difficult as the election draws nearer . 
FUSING HER POPULARITY ( AND HER CURRENT -------------------------------------- ORGANIZATION ) WITH HER PARTY ----------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG Royal  ] 's primary victory gives her allies in the [ORG PS  ] unchallenged control of the party apparatus . 
Party chief [PER Francois Hollande  ] , who is also [ORG Royal  ] 's long-time domestic partner , will be instrumental in putting the party fully in the service of [ORG Royal  ] 's campaign . 
The next step for [ORG Royal  ] is " making the party headquarters my campaign headquarters . 
" According to one of her closest allies in the party hierarchy , her campaign strategy projects two key lines of action: " continuing to be what has made her popular , " while bringing to bear the party 's electioneering expertise and energizing the party 's dense network of elected officials throughout the country. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG Royal  ] 's upcoming campaign will continue to feature [LOC PARIS  ] 00007424 002 OF 003 the personal characteristics on which her popularity is founded , while also working to improve some of her weaknesses as a candidate . 
She has shown a vulnerability to getting rattled during TV appearances or before hostile publics . 
Because she has not had top-level experience in some issue areas , particularly foreign affairs , deepening her command of these briefs will be a top priority . 
THE CORE OF THE " SEGOLENE PHENOMENON " ------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG PS Party  ] spokesman and long time [ORG Royal  ] ally [PER Julian Dray  ] recently enumerated to us the four personal characteristics that make [ORG Royal  ] so popular . 
They are the key elements of " the [MISC Segolene  ] story " that connects so powerfully with such a wide electorate . 
-- First , " She 's a mom . 
" [ORG Royal  ] has raised four children with [PER Hollande  ] . 
That experience , according to [PER Dray  ] , " gives ordinary people confidence " that she might be genuinely caring towards them also -- very different from the subliminal sentiments towards ordinary people associated with members of [LOC France  ] 's aloof and inbred political class . 
-- Second , " She has a successful marriage . 
" Even though [PER Royal  ] and [PER Hollande  ] have never legally married , their long-standing relationship is viewed as an exemplary " success in love " -- and people admire that , wishing for the same in their own lives . 
-- Third , " She 's a beautiful woman . 
" This element of novelty and of gender equality -- with a touch of feminist revanchism in an electorate that is 53 percent female thrown in -- are part and parcel of [PER Royal  ] 's success . 
-- Finally , " She 's highly competent . 
" [PER Royal  ] has distinguished herself through her professional achievements . 
Her rise -- notwithstanding her family 's modest means and very traditionalist social values ( i.e. women become wives , not presidents ) -- through [LOC France  ] 's witheringly competitive educational meritocracy , are recognized by voters as those of an extraordinary individual , worthy of consideration for [LOC France  ] 's highest office . 
CRITICAL OF [LOC U.S.  ] APPROACH , YET OFTEN ------------------------------------ STILL IN SYNCH ON SUBSTANCE --------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Royal  ] , as is to be expected from the standard bearer of [LOC France  ] 's center-left [ORG Socialist Party  ] , can be quite direct , even harsh in her assessments of [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy initiatives . 
As is the case nearly across the board -- left and right -- among the members of [LOC France  ] 's political class , [PER Royal  ] has made clear that she opposed the [MISC U.S.-led  ] invasion of [LOC Iraq  ] in 2003 , and what she saw as the high-handed [LOC U.S.  ] dismissal of multilateral , [MISC UN-led  ] efforts to defuse the crisis . 
However , in some of her more recent statements on [LOC Iraq  ] , [PER Royal  ] has clearly broken with the conventional wisdom in [LOC France  ] , particularly that of the [MISC French  ] left . 
After a meeting with [MISC Iraqi  ] president [PER Jalal Talibabi  ] in [LOC Paris  ] last November 3 , [PER Royal  ] told reporters that , despite all the problems there , [LOC Iraq  ] " is getting back on its feet . 
" She underlined that the [MISC Iraqi  ] government , " not outsiders " should decide " when the time has come " for withdrawal of foreign forces from the country . 
Reflecting her penchant for seeing war and peace problems in terms of their effect on the lives of everyday people first ( rather than in terms of balance of power among states , regional stability , etc . 
) , [ORG Royal  ] stressed the importance of " a swift reconstruction of that country , which was so ravaged by dictatorship , so that the [MISC Iraqi  ] people who have suffered so so much ( emphasis hers ) might recover their dignity and their self-confidence , and desire to get back on the road to success . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Repeatedly , in her pronouncements on international issues , [ORG Royal  ] has insisted on the legitimacy and pre-eminence of the [ORG U.N.  ] in acting against threats to international peace and security . 
[ORG Royal 's  ] statements on the conflict in [LOC Lebanon  ] last summer , for example , reflected the view that ending the suffering of the conflict 's civilian casualties ( on both sides ) should be the first priority , addressed by an immediate cease-fire , to be followed by [MISC UN-mediated  ] disengagement , and the disarming of [MISC Hezbollah  ] . 
In addition , she proposed that former President [PER Clinton  ] be considered as a special [ORG UN  ] mediator for the conflict . 
A [ORG Royal advisor  ] pointed to this proposal as illustrative of her inclination to personalize political issues . 
[ORG Royal 's  ] reaction to the [MISC Israel-Hezbollah  ] confrontation -- seeing the crisis first and foremost through the prism of its impact on ordinary people , [LOC PARIS  ] 00007424 003 OF 003 while advocating the empowerment of the [ORG UN  ] to seek a longer-term solution -- reflect what is likely to be [ORG Royal  ] 's approach to international conflicts . 
In [PER Dray  ] 's words , spoken as a close friend of [ORG Royal 's  ] for many years , " She 's not interested in the theory , and approaches problems in terms of what 's being proposed to solve them . 
" If true , this would certainly represent a refreshing break from the ingrained [MISC French  ] preference for the theoretical over the empirical. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In her recent statements specifically about the [LOC U.S.  ] , [ORG Royal  ] has not been shy about criticizing what she has repeatedly termed the " attitude " of the [LOC U.S  ] . 
-- [LOC America  ] 's willingness to act outside of the consensus of the international community . 
[ORG Royal  ] 's America-bashing however , concerns more the form of [LOC U.S.  ] policy than its substance . 
In fact , to the extent she has expressed herself on them , her views on some key issues are in fact quite close to those of the [LOC U.S.  ] A striking example of this is the way [ORG Royal  ] has been the most outspoken of [LOC France  ] 's major political figures about the danger posed by [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear weapons ambitions . 
She has spoken explicitly about the threat to [LOC Israel  ] 's existence of nuclear weapons in the hands of the current [MISC Iranian  ] leadership , and has gone so far as to suggest that [LOC Iran  ] 's civil nuclear program , because it is a stepping-stone to a weapons program , is illegitimate in light of [LOC Iran  ] 's reneging on its non-proliferation obligations . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) If elected -- and that is a big if that is still a long way down the road -- [ORG Royal  ] appears to be someone who would approach world affairs pragmatically and would seek to maintain a close , if critical , relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] There may be a fresh opportunity for [LOC Washington  ] policy makers to take her measure if , as we know her staff is considering , she goes through with plans to visit the [LOC U.S.  ] at some point before the end of January , when the presidential campaign begins in earnest .
