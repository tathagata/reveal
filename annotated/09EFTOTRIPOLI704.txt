( [LOC SBU/NF  ] ) In an August 29 meeting , [MISC Libyan  ] Protocol Chief [PER Nuri  ] al-Mismari confirmed that plans for [MISC Libyan  ] leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] to stay in [LOC Englewood  ] , [LOC NJ  ] are off . 
Instead , the [ORG GOL  ] is focusing on finding accommodations for [PER Qadhafi  ] in [LOC Manhattan  ] . 
According to [PER Mismari  ] , the most likely outcome is that [PER Qadhafi  ] will stay at the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Permrep  ] 's residence in [LOC Manhattan  ] . 
[PER Mismari  ] showed [MISC A/DCM  ] an August 25 e-mail from him to the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG Permrep  ] , telling him to abort plans to use the [LOC NJ  ] residence , noting that , " see , you didn't need to pressure me about this ; we were already working on an alternative arrangement . 
" [PER Mismari  ] said that , if asked , the [ORG GOL  ] will tell journalists that it is not using the [LOC NJ  ] residence because the necessary renovations will not be completed in time for [PER Qadhafi  ] 's visit . 
[PER Mismari  ] stressed that any further [ORG USG  ] public comment on the issue would be " damaging , " and that the [MISC Libyan  ] Government doesn't want things to " spin out of control , and then he [ [PER Qadhafi  ] ] will get involved , and not want to do the trip at all . 
" [PER Mismari  ] was keenly interested in the potential protests in [LOC Englewood  ] on August 30 , noting that he really hopes they have been canceled . 
He asked that [MISC A/DCM  ] contact him as soon as possible if any news about the protests is heard. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC SBU/NF  ] ) [PER Mismari  ] showed [MISC A/DCM  ] a fax he sent August 28 to the [MISC Libyan  ] missions in [LOC NY  ] and [LOC DC  ] , telling them to focus henceforth only on the " official purpose " of [PER Qadhafi  ] 's visit , and to cancel planning for " extraneous " activities , such as a [PER Qadhafi  ] walk through of [LOC Harlem  ] , and some press roundtables . 
" I want to wait for things to cool down in the [LOC U.S.  ] before proceeding with any such extra events , " he said. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC SBU/NF  ] ) [PER Mismari  ] asked [MISC A/DCM  ] about flight clearances for the [PER Qadhafi  ] delegation . 
He said his current plan is for the delegation to travel on the [ORG Ifriqiyah Airways  ] VIP plane to [LOC Portugal  ] , then charter a separate plane for the delegation to use to travel to [LOC NY  ] . 
He inquired if " this will work for your people . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC SBU/NF  ] ) Comment: [PER Mismari  ] , even in the frenzy of the lead-up to the September 1 celebration , seemed remarkably focused on [PER Qadhafi  ] 's [LOC NY  ] trip . 
He kept both the [MISC Italian  ] Ambassador and an [MISC Italian  ] Prime Ministerial advance team and the two lead organizers of the September 1 events waiting for an hour , even though [MISC A/DCM  ] offered that he should meet the others first , as they all had arrived at the same time . 
[PER Mismari  ] appeared very committed to the success of the [LOC NY  ] trip , stressing , " This is not about [PER Qadhafi  ] or [PER Obama  ] , but rather about our two countries and peoples writ large . 
This trip has to move forward , so the relationship can progress , and we do not leave future generations of [MISC Libyans  ] and [MISC Americans  ] to deal with this hot potato of abnormal bilateral relations .
