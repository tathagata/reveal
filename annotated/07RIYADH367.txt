Oberwetter  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) SUMMARY: Assistant to the President for [ORG Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Francis  ] Fragos [PER Townsend  ] covered both counterterrorism cooperation and regional political issues in her meeting with Foreign Minister [PER Prince Saud  ] Al-Faisal at his home in [LOC Jeddah  ] on February 6 . 
[PER Saud  ] described the February 2 arrests of ten suspected terrorism financiers in [LOC Jeddah  ] and [LOC Medina  ] as a positive step that could well result in other leads and arrests . 
On the proposed [ORG Charities Commission  ] , [PER Saud  ] said that the [ORG SAG  ] is leaning toward establishing a government entity that directly disburses charitable funds . 
He characterized engagement with [LOC Iran  ] as a two-pronged approach involving frank dialogue and security pressure . 
" We will supply the logic and you supply the pressure , " he said , adding that the [ORG US Navy  ] 's recent strengthening of presence in the [LOC Gulf  ] was a good example of the force element . 
In response to APHSCT [PER Townsend  ] 's request to use [ORG SAG  ] influence with [ORG Arabsat  ] to block [ORG Al-Manar  ] broadcasting , [PER Prince Saud  ] replied that Iranian-financed cultural centers in [LOC Lebanon  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] are a greater source of [MISC Iranian  ] influence in the region than [ORG Al-Manar  ] television . 
On [MISC Arab-Israeli  ] issues , [PER Prince Saud  ] hoped Secretary [PER Rice  ] would return to the region soon to address the " key substantive issues " of [LOC Jerusalem  ] and [MISC Palestinian  ] refugees . 
In a subsequent private meeting , APHSCT [PER Townsend  ] renewed [LOC US  ] concerns about the [MISC Saudi  ] Ambassador in the [LOC Philippines  ] ; [PER Saud  ] said that the ambassador would be ending his tour shortly . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) APHSCT [PER Townsend  ] commended [PER Prince Saud  ] on efforts to counter terrorist financing but urged more progress . 
She noted that the President was quite concerned about bilateral cooperation in this area and that she had a letter for King [PER Abdullah  ] from the President on this subject . 
[PER Prince Saud  ] replied that the arrests of ten terror financing suspects on February 2 was " good progress " but that " more needs to be done . 
" Questioning these suspects could lead to more leads and arrests , he noted . 
APHSCT [PER Townsend  ] said she had just met with Finance Minister al-Assaf to ask about the royal decree on declaring cash upon exit and entry . 
The King had issued the decree over one year ago but it has yet to be implemented . 
[PER Prince Saud  ] noted that the Customs people are not the most capable , and that he was surprised at the lack of implementation. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) Asked by [PER Prince Saud  ] what the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] could do to help on counterterrorism cooperation , APHSCT [PER Townsend  ] raised establishment of the [ORG Charities Commission  ] , which was announced two years ago but not yet implemented . 
She noted that it could be set up in either of two ways: as a government body which is responsible for disbursing charitable donations ; or as a regulatory body to oversee acts of the private charities , which is the way the [LOC US  ] does it . 
She stressed that a decision , either way , is needed . 
[PER Saud  ] said the [ORG SAG  ] was leaning towards an organization that has direct responsibility for disbursing charitable funds . 
He noted there are [MISC Islamic  ] law implications , implying that these implications are slowing down the decision process but are important to consider carefully . 
APHSCT [PER Townsend  ] raised the issue of continuing activity by remnants of the [MISC UN-sanctioned  ] al-Haramain organization . 
[PER Saud  ] responded that any proposed illegal transfers are being monitored and stopped . 
By following the trail of illegal transfers , the [ORG SAG  ] has found and stopped the source of funding in many investigations-- sending a strong preventative message to others engaging in similar , illegal activities . 
APHSCT [PER Townsend  ] thanked [PER Prince Saud  ] for the [ORG SAG  ] 's efforts in this area <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Asked by APHSCT [PER Townsend  ] about his views of developments in [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Prince Saud  ] described the recent [MISC Iranian  ] message , brought by [PER Larijani  ] , offering to help prevent a Sunni/Shi'ite sectarian divide . 
[PER Saud  ] said his government is focused on [MISC Iranian  ] actions , not words . 
The [MISC Saudis  ] had earlier warned the [MISC Iranians  ] against pursuing a " dangerous " policy of sectarian division , especially in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
He said [LOC Iran  ] was embarking on a dangerous path of " fitna " ( dissention ) within the [MISC Muslim  ] community . 
Although there is a [MISC Shi'ite  ] majority in [LOC Iraq  ] , elsewhere in the region the [LOC Shi'a  ] are a minority . 
A sectarian-based policy in [LOC Iraq  ] could jeopardize the situation of these [MISC Shi'ite  ] minorities outside [ORG RIYADH  ] 00000367 002 OF 003 [LOC Iraq  ] , he noted. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Saud  ] compared the [MISC Iranian  ] influence in [LOC Iraq  ] with [MISC Iranian  ] influence in [LOC Lebanon  ] , commenting that he saw positive signs in [LOC Lebanon  ] , where [LOC Iran  ] urged [ORG Hizbollah  ] to stop street protests and go back to their homes . 
[PER Saud  ] said that it is [ORG SAG  ] policy to pursue very frank discussions with the [MISC Iranians  ] ; we need a joint policy of frankness and security pressure , he stressed . 
Strengthening the [ORG US Navy  ] presence in the [LOC Gulf  ] sent a good message . 
" You provide the pressure and we'll provide the logic , " he said. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) APHSCT [PER Townsend  ] said that [ORG Hizbollah  ] does not appear to the [LOC US  ] to have toned down its rhetoric , and she raised the request for [MISC Saudi  ] help with [ORG Arabsat  ] to block the broadcast of al-Manar television . 
Blocking al-Manar would help reduce [ORG Hizbollah  ] 's sphere of influence , she said . 
The [MISC French  ] have agreed not to permit the broadcast of al-Manar , she noted . 
[PER Prince Saud  ] replied that the " more important problem " is the [ORG Hizbollah  ] cultural center , which exercises greater influence than al-Manar television and could be closed down by the multi-national forces , he asserted . 
The [MISC Iranians  ] also fund such centers in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] , he said. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
C ) Ambassador [PER Oberwetter  ] asked [PER Prince Saud  ] about media reports ahead of [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Putin  ] 's visit to [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] on February 11-12 regarding a [MISC Russian  ] interest in discussing a " [LOC Middle East Security Regime  ] . 
" [PER Prince Saud  ] said that he was unaware of such a plan , and that the scheduled visit will focus on bilateral relations , including military cooperation and economic agreements . 
He noted that the [MISC Saudis  ] will raise the possible purchase of military equipment from the [MISC Russians  ] because " your people told us it would be better purchased from [LOC Russia  ] , because they are cheaper and just as good . 
" He said he did not know why the [LOC US  ] had told the [LOC Kingdom  ] to go to the [MISC Russians  ] , but that they would nonetheless . 
He added that the [MISC Saudis  ] will raise [ORG UN Security Council  ] issues , especially the tribunal to look into the [PER Hariri  ] assassination , and the Quartet issues. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) On [MISC Arab-Israeli  ] issues , [PER Prince Saud  ] said that he talked with Secretary [PER Rice  ] via telephone on February 4 about the [MISC Fatah-Hamas  ] reconciliation meeting in [LOC Mecca  ] . 
He said if they reach an agreement , the [MISC Saudis  ] would hope for a positive [LOC US  ] reaction . 
He hoped that there would not be too many conditions placed upon [ORG Hamas  ] in order for it to enter into a national unity government . 
APHSCT [PER Townsend  ] said they [LOC US  ] expected [ORG Hamas  ] to stop fighting and to make progress on peace with [LOC Israel  ] . 
More important than what they say is what they do , she stressed . 
[PER Saud  ] stressed the importance of having clear guidelines and goals , which are applied to both sides of the conflict . 
He said he expects Secretary [PER Rice  ] to return to the region , to meet with Prime Minister [PER Olmert  ] and President [PER Abu Mazen  ] . 
He said he hopes she will address the substantive issues - [LOC Jerusalem  ] and [MISC Palestinian  ] refugees -- and noted that it has been seven years since anyone has discussed the status of [LOC Jerusalem  ] . 
The side issues , for instance opening a passage between [LOC Gaza  ] and the [LOC West Bank  ] , should be handled at a different level , by Assistant Secretary [PER Welch  ] , he suggested . 
SIPDIS <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) In a following private meeting with [PER Saud  ] , attended only by the Ambassador , APHSCT [PER Townsend  ] raised [LOC US  ] concerns with the potential involvement of the [MISC Saudi  ] ambassador to the [LOC Philippines  ] Muhammad [PER Amin Waly  ] in terrorism facilitation , particularly his intervention to get two members of [MISC IIRO  ] out of prison . 
[PER Prince Saud  ] said some of his actions may have involved bad judgment rather than intentional support for terrorism . 
[PER Waly  ] had been investigated , he said , and no evidence was found regarding his involvement . 
Since this Ambassador 's assignment in [LOC Manila  ] would be ending in several months , [PER Saud  ] asked for [ORG USG  ] evidence of his involvement . 
APHSCT [PER Townsend  ] said the [ORG USG  ] would cooperate with the [ORG Mubahith  ] in providing evidence. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) Prince [PER Saud  ] then raised in the private meeting the [MISC Saudi  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Washington  ] 's problems with the [LOC US  ] bank that handles the [ORG Embassy  ] account . 
He asserted that the [LOC US  ] bank is performing audits on the [MISC Saudi  ] [ORG Embassy  ] bank accounts beyond what is required by [LOC US  ] law , and asking inappropriate and aggressive questions . 
He noted that the [MISC Saudi  ] [ORG Embassy  ] enjoys diplomatic immunity . 
If this is the bank 's initiative , he asked for [ORG USG  ] intercession . 
APHSCT [PER Townsend  ] said we would look into it .
