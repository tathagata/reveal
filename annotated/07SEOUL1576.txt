[PER Alexander Vershbow  ] . 
Reasons 1.4 ( b/d ) . 
SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] Arranging an [PER Eric Clapton  ] concert in [LOC Pyongyang  ] could also be useful , he said , given [PER Kim Jong-il’s  ] second son’s devotion to the rock legend . 
END SUMMARY . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] DOING BUSINESS IN THE [ORG DPRK  ] -------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) For an outsider to get anything done in the [ORG DPRK  ] , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] advised , it is necessary to get the [ORG DPRK’s  ] various institutions to cooperate . 
Each institution seems to have veto power , but none has the power to push anything forward . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] the only organizations that can really deliver are the military , which does not talk to anybody , or the [ORG Red Cross  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] DIVIDED FAMILIES INITIATIVE --------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] advocated in favor of [ORG USG  ] involvement in facilitating the reunification of [MISC Korean-American  ] families divided by the [MISC Korean  ] War . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that currently two groups organize these visits for [MISC Korean-Americans  ] . 
The first is [ORG Compatriots United  ] , which has arranged thousands of reunions . 
However , the group is controlled by the [ORG DPRK’s Overseas Compatriots Committee  ] and extorts a tremendous amount of money from desperate families to arrange the visits . 
Families seeking to participate must pay USD 300 to apply and submit comprehensive personal and financial information . 
If selected , the families are forced to pay for unwanted sightseeing excursions in [LOC North Korea  ] . 
Before they are finally able to see their relatives , which is always just hours before their departing flight , they are often told that the relatives had to travel to the meeting place by taxi and owed several thousand dollars in fare . 
As [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] explained , these are desperate , old people who would pay anything . 
After the trip , the participants typically get repeated correspondence from the [MISC North Korean  ] government asking for money to assist the family members , who are sometimes falsely alleged to be ill. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The other group active in family reunions is Pyongtong in [LOC Los Angeles  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the group recently arranged for 15 persons to visit family members in the [ORG DPRK  ] . 
However , the [ORG DPRK  ] canceled the arrangement after the group went to the press . 
[LOC Pyongyang  ] ultimately intervened and instructed the [ORG Compatriots Committee  ] to help facilitate the visit . 
Thus , Pyongtong was able to arrange a visit for six people a few weeks ago. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that [LOC North Korea  ] would not run such an exploitative system if the [LOC United States  ] government were involved in the process . 
There is a reluctance , he said , for [MISC Korean-Americans  ] to pursue family reunions because they do not want to divulge their personal information to the [ORG DPRK  ] and they do not want the [LOC North Koreans  ] to milk them for money before , during and after the reunion . 
The [ORG USG  ] could at least volunteer to serve as a conduit for correspondence between these families and [LOC North Korea  ] to prevent the [ORG DPRK  ] from learning the home addresses and bank accounts of participants . 
The [ORG DPRK  ] might be willing to accept this structure because it badly wants a relationship with [LOC Washington  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ----------------------------- [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] did not see hope for inter-Korean engagement , despite the widely acclaimed railroad test. “North [MISC Koreans  ] have no intention of dealing with ( [MISC South Koreans  ] ) . 
The [MISC South Koreans  ] really think they can help . 
They don’t understand that [LOC North Korea  ] is sealed.” BOOK [PER ERIC CLAPTON  ] ----------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] passed on the suggestion from his [MISC North Korean  ] interlocutors that the [ORG USG  ] arrange for [PER Eric Clapton  ] to perform a concert in [LOC Pyongyang  ] . 
As [PER Kim Jong-il’s  ] second son , [PER Kim Jong-chol  ] , is reported to be a great fan , the performance could be an opportunity to build good will .
