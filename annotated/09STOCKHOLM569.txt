( U ) ACTION REQUEST: The [ORG USG  ] is currently batting 0 for 8 in responding to [MISC Swedish  ] invitations for minister-level attendance at [ORG EU  ] meetings . 
Post requests Washington’s help in securing a senior [ORG USG  ] official visit to a suitable [LOC Presidency  ] event in [LOC Sweden  ] during this fall . 
End Action request ------ - Plea for Senior [LOC U.S.  ] Official to Attend [ORG EU  ] Informal Ministerial on Competitiveness ------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On September 1 , the Ambassador paid a courtesy call on Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for [ORG Enterprise and Energy  ] [PER Maud Olofsson  ] , the [MISC Swedish  ] official at the forefront of the robust [MISC U.S.-Swedish  ] cooperation in alternative technology through the “One Big Thing” alternative energy partnership , and related programs . 
[PER Olofsson  ] explained the main theme of Sweden’s [ORG EU  ] Presidency , transformation to an eco-efficient economy , i.e. achieving economic growth while reducing green house gas emissions . 
( Comment: [LOC Sweden  ] is a proven leader in this area having grown its economy 46 percent between 1992 and 2008 , while reducing its green house gas emissions by 9 percent . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Sweden  ] has held a series of [MISC EU-related  ] meetings and Informal Ministerials to promote eco-efficiency , including a July 2009 meeting of Ministers for Energy and Environment . 
The [MISC Swedish  ] government has invited [LOC White House  ] , cabinet-level and sub-cabinet level [LOC U.S.  ] officials to these events to present [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to the informal gatherings of [MISC European  ] Ministers , but so far none have been able to come . 
( Comment: It is unprecedented for an [ORG EU  ] Presidency host to invite [ORG USG  ] officials of any level to their informal ministerial meetings . 
During the [MISC Swedish  ] Presidency , there have been a flood of such invitations . 
This may have to do with Foreign Minister [PER Carl Bildt’s  ] personal predilection , now shared by his fellow Ministers , to shake things up and to do things differently . 
While [ORG USG  ] officials may have been surprised by such invitations , we should seriously consider taking advantage of the unprecedented opportunity the [MISC Swedes  ] have given us . 
End Comment ) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Olofsson  ] said it is time to see results from strong [MISC U.S.-Swedish  ] cooperation in clean technology in line with efforts toward a climate change agreement in [LOC Copenhagen  ] and the new [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Administration’s  ] investment in new alternative energy technology. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Olofsson  ] noted that [LOC Sweden  ] would have liked a senior [LOC U.S.  ] official to attend some of the meetings at the July 2009 [ORG EU  ] Informal Ministerial in Are of [LOC Energy  ] and Environment Ministers in order to be part of the dialog on eco-efficiency and tell the [ORG EU  ] Ministers what is happening in the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) [PER Olofsson  ] said her priority is to have a Ministerial-level [LOC U.S.  ] official attend the Informal Meeting of [ORG EU  ] Competiveness Ministers in [LOC Umea  ] , [LOC Sweden  ] on October 14-16 . 
She stressed the importance of showing [MISC European  ] Ministers that developing a green economy is a [LOC U.S.  ] priority. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) Note on Invitations Extended to [ORG USG  ] officials: The Embassy is aware of the following [ORG USG  ] officials being invited by the [MISC Swedish  ] [ORG EU  ] Presidency to present to [ORG EU  ] Informal Ministerial meetings in Sweden: Secretary of Energy Chu Deputy Secretary of [ORG Energy Poneman Assistant  ] to the President for [ORG Energy and Climate Change  ] Browner Secretary of Labor Solis Secretary of Health Sebelius Secretary of [ORG Homeland Security Napolitano  ] Secretary [PER Clinton  ] Deputy Secretary [PER Lew Special Envoy Stern  ] [LOC STOCKHOLM  ] 00000569 002 OF 004 Of those , the invitations Secretary [PER Clinton  ] , Deputy Secretary [PER Lew  ] and Special Envoy [PER Stern  ] to attend [ORG EU  ] Development Days October 22-24 are still pending . 
The other invitations were declined . 
In addition , [LOC Sweden  ] has invited Assistant Secretary-level and other [LOC U.S.  ] officials . 
Assistant Secretary of [ORG Energy Zoi  ] invited to the [ORG EU  ] Strategic [ORG Energy Plan  ] conference October 20-21 , invitation still pending . 
Assistant Secretary of State for [ORG Africa Carson  ] represented the [ORG USG  ] at the [MISC U.S.-EU  ] Troika Meeting on [LOC Africa  ] July 14 Assistant Secretary for [MISC European  ] and [ORG Eurasian Affairs  ] [PER Phil Gordon  ] represented the [LOC U.S.  ] at the [ORG U.S.-EU Political Director  ] Troika on July 3 . 
[ORG Department of Homeland Security Deputy  ] Secretary [PER Lute  ] visited [LOC Sweden  ] at the [LOC U.S.  ] initiative for bilateral discussions , which was much appreciated by the [ORG GOS  ] . 
Other [LOC U.S.  ] officials who have visited recently at the [LOC U.S.  ] initiative for bilateral consultations with [LOC Sweden  ] related to the [MISC Swedish  ] [ORG EU  ] Presidency include: Special Envoy for [ORG Eurasian Energy Morningstar Special Advisor  ] for the [LOC Great Lakes Region  ] of [ORG Africa Wolpe Treasury Assistant  ] Secretary [PER Cohen End Note  ] ----- Need to [MISC See Results From  ] [ORG U.S. Interest  ] in [LOC Green Technology  ] ----- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) [PER Olofsson  ] said she discussed eco-efficiency with [ORG U.S. Energy  ] Secretary [PER Chu  ] . 
She noted that there was a lot of “low hanging fruit” where the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Sweden  ] could get results , such as cooperation in building technologies and transport systems . 
She said the challenge was to find proactive cooperation between [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Swedish  ] businesses on concrete projects in the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Europe  ] . 
She said possible areas for business collaboration included building sustainable cities , and rebuilding in older communities , such as the sustainable development project in [LOC Stockholm’s  ] formerly run-down [ORG Hammarby  ] district . 
[PER Olofsson  ] invited [LOC U.S.  ] officials to call her to propose projects. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) [PER Olofsson  ] suggested that [LOC Sweden  ] could perhaps arrange an eco-efficient activity in the years ahead to promote business and innovation . 
[ORG Altera  ] noted that the way to do this was to ask for practical advice from businessmen on productive areas . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] side noted that [LOC U.S.  ] firms are in the forefront of many of these areas , such as energy efficiency and improved housing construction. ------- Taking the [ORG U.S.-Sweden Alternative Energy Partnership  ] to the [ORG EU  ] Level ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) [PER Olofsson  ] noted that [MISC U.S.-Sweden  ] cooperation included extending the [ORG U.S.-Sweden Alternative Energy Partnership  ] to the [ORG EU  ] level . 
Her State Secretary [PER Ola Altera  ] explained how said [LOC Sweden  ] was ready to launch the Next Big Thing ( [ORG NBT  ] ) , the [ORG U.S.-EU Alternative Energy Partnership  ] , and wanted to launch it at the [LOC U.S.-EU Summit  ] planned for early [MISC November.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) [ORG Altera  ] said he had consulted his State Secretary colleagues , [PER Gustav Lind  ] in the PM’s office and MFA’s [PER Frank Belfrage  ] , and everyone agreed that [LOC Sweden  ] should be talking to the [ORG European Commission  ] about [ORG NBT.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Altera  ] said the [MISC Swedish  ] [ORG EU  ] Presidency is positive to both [LOC U.S.  ] energy initiatives , [ORG NBT  ] and the [ORG U.S.-EU Energy Council  ] , and to the broad approach behind both efforts . 
He said Sweden’s priority is [ORG NBT  ] , technology , research , entrepreneurship of alternative technology , and being results-oriented . 
He said [LOC Sweden  ] does not want to see these efforts bogged down by geo-political discussions of the security side of the energy issue . 
Therefore , he said , if [ORG NBT  ] can be part of the [ORG U.S.-Energy Council  ] that would be good , but we should drop that link if it would bog down work on [ORG NBT.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Altera  ] also noted the value of the [ORG Transatlantic Economic Council  ] ( [ORG TEC  ] ) , but said [LOC Sweden  ] wants to avoid the risk of bogging down [ORG NBT  ] if it is “run through people in [LOC Brussels.”  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Altera  ] said we need to work intensely to get [ORG NBT  ] as a [PER STOCKHOLM  ] 00000569 003 OF 004 result of the [LOC U.S.-EU Summit  ] . 
He said it would be important for the [ORG NBT  ] , [ORG U.S.-EU Energy Council  ] or “whatever we call it” to meet before Christmas 2009 in order to set the course , and get the effort started. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) [ORG Altera  ] said his [ORG Ministry  ] was taking a pragmatic approach to launching the [ORG NBT  ] , listening to various views . 
When the [LOC U.S.  ] side suggested that [ORG NBT  ] needed to be distilled down so it could be absorbed into the systems of other countries , [ORG Altera  ] referred to practical meetings on the [ORG U.S.-Sweden Alternative Energy Partnership  ] held between [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Swedish  ] business that helped shape the successful bilateral [MISC U.S.-Sweden  ] alternative energy partnership . 
[PER Olofsson  ] said [LOC Sweden  ] could arrange meetings to connect companies as part of the [MISC US-EU  ] alternative energy partnership , and even co-finance projects if that is needed . 
Referring to her government’s report on eco-efficient economies ( which is at the link www.se2009.eu/polopoly_fs/1.6629 ! menu/standard/file/A%20European% 20Eco%20Efficient%20Economy.pdf ) , [PER Olofsson  ] said we should pick out areas in the forefront of this effort for such cooperation. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( U ) Finally , [ORG Altera  ] noted that [ORG NBT  ] does not replace the strong [MISC U.S.-Sweden  ] bilateral cooperation on alternative energy. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: Following the meeting , the Embassy got additional details about [MISC Swedish  ] plans for launching the [ORG NBT  ] from [PER Maria Brogren  ] at the [ORG Energy Division of the Ministry  ] . 
She noted that the [ORG European Council  ] had ordered the [ORG Commission  ] to give its opinion on the [MISC U.S.-proposed  ] [ORG U.S.-EU Energy Council  ] . 
She repeated that her government’s first priority and preference would be to launch [ORG NBT  ] at the [LOC U.S.-EU Summit  ] with participation by Secretary [PER Chu  ] , Secretary [PER Clinton  ] , Minister [PER Olofsson  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Bildt  ] . 
She said [LOC Sweden  ] would like to see that foursome present for the first meeting of the [ORG Energy Council  ] . 
But , she said , if geopolitics bogs down the [ORG Energy Council  ] , [LOC Sweden  ] would want to move on the technology sub group effort of the [ORG Energy Council  ] by launching the Next Big Thing and later folding it into the technology working group of the [ORG Energy Council  ] . 
End Comment. ------- Bridging the Gap on Illegal File Sharing ------ <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador concluded the meeting by raising intellectual property rights , since [ORG Olofsson’s  ] party ( the [ORG Center Party  ] ) is the one member of the ruling coalition least supportive of [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to improve Sweden’s efforts against illegal file sharing . 
[PER Olofsson  ] said there are discussions within the government about putting more legislation in place against file sharing . 
While legislation is needed , and [LOC Sweden  ] follows [MISC European  ] level legislation , she argued that a solution should not only be left to politicians via legislation . 
The problem was a market failure , the lack of a product that people could easily access at a reasonable price . 
Many young people , she said , think that all file sharing is free . 
It is hard to change their perception of the rules . 
[PER Olofsson  ] said she wanted artists and creative people to be paid for their ideas , but we need to create a market solution that is easy for people to follow. <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC U.S.  ] side countered that as knowledge-based economies , both the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Sweden  ] have a lot to loose from illegal file sharing . 
We need to make this public debate about the artists being stolen from. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Olofsson  ] noted that [ORG Nokia  ] and [ORG Ericsson  ] have introduced new services to share products while paying the artists , which is good . 
We need to find a way to pay artists property , not just to pass legislation , she repeated. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Olofsson  ] said we need to understand how young people see the problem . 
We should talk about what is happening now , not just pass legislation , she stressed . 
She pointed to the success of Sweden’s [ORG Pirate Party  ] in the [MISC European Parliamentary elections  ] as an example of that young people “do not trust us.” She said the [ORG Pirate Party  ] attracted voters from both the right and the left , and the [ORG Pirate Party  ] MEP now has two advisors , one with a background in the [ORG Left Party  ] , and one from a neo-liberal party. ------ Final Comment ----- <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The request for help in securing a senior [ORG USG  ] official visit to [LOC Sweden  ] during the remaining months of the Presidency was a direct plea for help . 
[PER Olofsson  ] said that she is hopeful that the [ORG USG  ] will be able to demonstrate the importance it attaches to the bilateral links in the Alternative energy area by actually sending a senior official to a meeting where the [MISC Swedes  ] host its [MISC European  ] partners .
