GATES Classified By: Acting DCM [PER Valerie C. Fowler  ] for reasons 1.4 ( B ) and ( D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Embassy [LOC Kabul  ] warmly welcomes your visit to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The overall state of the security situation here is more nuanced than the negative drumbeat coming from the media . 
Steady advances in success by [ORG Coalition and Afghan National Security Forces  ] ( [ORG ANSF  ] ) do not grab the headlines that a spectacular suicide attack does . 
Progress in development in support of a balanced [MISC COIN  ] strategy continues below the radar screen . 
Those achievements , however , are hindered and ultimately threatened by poor performance on the governance front. --------------------------------------------- ----- The [ORG Fundamental Challenge of Governance  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Karzai  ] is at the center of the governance challenge . 
He has failed to overcome his fundamental leadership deficiencies in decisiveness and in confidence to delegate authority to competent subordinates . 
The result: a cycle of overwork/fatigue/indecision on the part of [PER Karzai  ] , and gridlock and a sense of drift among senior officials on nearly all critical policy decisions. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Karzai  ] struggles with striking the correct balance between institutional and traditional ( i.e. tribal ) governance . 
In fairness , there are no easy answers . 
He has given a notional nod to General [PER McKiernan  ] , s proposal to support formal agreements between [MISC Afghan  ] authorities and district-level councils . 
The latter would be responsible for certain governance and security functions in their districts . 
This proposal is aimed at ensuring freedom of travel along the [LOC Ring Road  ] , the lack of which undermines public confidence in the [MISC Afghan  ] government and in the international community’s efforts . 
Some questions remain on how to ensure district security arrangements do not create independent local militias. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Independent Directorate of Local Governance  ] ( [ORG IDLG  ] ) Director [PER Popal  ] has earned and maintains [PER Karzai  ] , s backing to improve sub-national governance . 
[PER Popal  ] has launched the [MISC Afghan  ] Social [ORG Outreach Program  ] ( [ORG ASOP  ] ) , to form local councils ( separate from [PER McKiernan  ] , s plan ) to strengthen ties between sub-national institutional government and the tribes . 
We will be one of the largest donors to this new and ambitious plan , providing $6 million for [ORG ASOP  ] in three provinces. --------- Elections --------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Next year , s presidential and provincial council elections will be the defining event for 2009 . 
Election factors already dominate nearly everything political here . 
[PER Karzai  ] , s popularity has fallen through the floor , but the absence of a credible opponent means it is still [PER Karzai  ] , s election to lose . 
Public ill ease over personal ( not national ) insecurity and disgust over unconstrained corruption are [PER Karzai  ] , s greatest vulnerabilities . 
He installed [PER Hanif Atmar  ] as Interior Minister to turn up the heat on both problems . 
[PER Atmar  ] is talented and may turn around perceptions , but after seven years of unmet expectations [MISC Afghans  ] will be hard to convince. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Politicians and the [LOC Kabul  ] punditry are fascinated with the political jockeying between Parliament and the [ORG Independent Election Commission  ] ( [ORG IEC  ] ) over the election date . 
In the end , we expect all will agree to the [ORG IEC  ] , s proposal for an August vote , based on security and logistical reasons. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) More problematic is the insecurity in the south and east , which is prompting some ) including [PER Karzai  ] , other [MISC Pashtuns  ] and some [MISC RC-South  ] partners ) to raise the specter of [PER Pashtun  ] disenfranchisement and the possible illegitimacy of the vote . 
It is much too early to judge the prospects of failure . 
We and [PER Karzai  ] agree the [MISC British  ] are not up to the task of securing [LOC Helmand  ] , but we also think the expected arrival of additional [LOC U.S.  ] combat brigades this spring and summer , in tandem with the constant flow of newly-minted [MISC Afghan  ] troops to the field will provide an adequately secure environment for the election. -------------------------- [ORG Taliban  ] reconciliation -------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG Karzai’s  ] senior-level [ORG Taliban  ] reconciliation initiative is more about strengthening his political base and his relationship with the [MISC Saudis  ] than anything else. “Negotiations” have been much less tangible in reality than is depicted in the press . 
The public is split: many welcome the promise ( whether real or not ) of reduced violence and instability via a possible reconciliation with the [ORG Taliban  ] , while others ( mainly non-Pashtuns , women , and certain civil society groups ) fear a [PER Karzai  ] backroom deal that could harm their political interests or set back hard-fought human rights advances . 
We have advised [PER Karzai  ] to negotiate from a position of strength and to restate our shared &red lines.8 ----------------------------------- [PER Karzai  ] and civilian casualties ----------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG Karzai’s  ] recent heated public statements about “bringing down [ORG NATO  ] aircraft” and timelines for coalition withdrawal reflect both deep and heartfelt anger , as well as a certain amount of elections grandstanding . 
Civilian casualties anger him most . 
General [PER McKiernan  ] has directed substantial changes to coalition tactics , techniques and procedures ( TTPs ) , but those cannot eliminate the possibility of civilian casualties , especially when the [ORG Taliban  ] has clearly adopted “human shield” tactics . 
[ORG ISAF  ] and the Embassy work increasingly more effectively with [MISC Afghan  ] counterparts on improved post-incident response ( to affected communities and the media ) , and investigations. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Karzai  ] hears of these efforts , but is not mollified . 
You can address his upset by acknowledging the problem and recognizing such mistakes hurt us all . 
In the months since the [LOC Shindand  ] incident , and specifically as a response to civilian casualties , the [MISC Afghans  ] have drafted a technical framework agreement on security measures , as a means to exert greater control over coalition operations . 
The Ambassador told [PER Spanta  ] that [LOC Washington  ] cannot take this up until after the new Administration is in place , a point you should underscore with [PER Karzai.  ] ------------------------------- Steps to [ORG Improve Security  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The [ORG Coalition  ] and [MISC Afghan  ] security forces have increased our area of control and taken the fight to the [ORG Taliban  ] , with increasing effectiveness . 
The [ORG Taliban  ] response has been a forced shift in tactics from insurgency to terrorism to challenge the will of [MISC Afghans  ] and the international community . 
[ORG Taliban  ] acts of violence are highly visible and the immediate effect is that ordinary [MISC Afghans  ] do feel less safe with random violence - particularly kidnappings - on the rise , and travel around the country more insecure . 
Atmar is countering , by looking to accelerate reform of the police . 
We are supporting him . 
The [ORG Focused District Development  ] ( [ORG FDD  ] ) program to retrain and equip the police is going well and will broaden to include the [ORG Border Police  ] . 
Nonetheless , professionalizing the [ORG Afghan National Police  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) and reforming the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] are ongoing challenges . 
We also are working with the [ORG IDLG  ] , [ORG NDS  ] , and the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] to engage community support for security along the highways. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Our greatest success on the security side is the advances in numbers and capabilities in the [MISC Afghan  ] army . 
The army is the most trusted governmental entity , and is currently leading more than 60 percent of joint military operations . 
The [ORG International Community  ] recently agreed to support the expansion of the army force structure to 134,000 ( which includes a 12,000-troop trainee , transient , patient “float” ) . 
Army expansion will help meet future security requirements and take some of the pressure off of the police to conduct counterinsurgency operations . 
The principal challenge for both the army and police training program is a shortage of trainers , either from the [LOC U.S.  ] or Allied nations . 
[PER Karzai  ] recognizes and is grateful for the central role of [LOC U.S.  ] security assistance in developing the [MISC Afghan  ] security forces . 
He will welcome reaffirmation of our support for eventual [MISC Afghan  ] self-sufficiency and independence in the security and law enforcement fields ; however , the army will continue to depend for some years on [ORG Coalition  ] enablers such as close air support and intelligence assets. --------------------------------------------- -------- [ORG Survey of Security  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] by [LOC Region  ] --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC RC-East  ] remains focused on a balanced [MISC COIN  ] approach synchronizing operations to protect the populace and push the insurgents out while pursuing mutually reinforcing efforts in development and governance assistance ; the Embassy , [ORG USAID  ] and CJTF-101 are coordinating more closely than ever [ORG USG  ] efforts in [ORG RC-East  ] . 
The Commanders , [ORG Emergency Response Program  ] ( [ORG CERP  ] ) funding is critical to delivering quick , effective assistance projects , which , in coordination with [ORG USAID  ] and local officials , supports both locally identified needs and longer term development goals . 
In [MISC RC-South  ] , the number and lethality of IED attacks is up dramatically ; significantly , in some areas the number of IEDs reported by the public to [ORG ANSF  ] or [ORG ISAF  ] forces is also up , reflecting public support for the Government . 
The approximately 2300 [MISC Marines  ] of the recently departed 24th MEU carried out successful operations in the [LOC Garmsir District  ] in [LOC Helmand  ] . 
The insertion of other [LOC U.S.  ] forces into the [LOC South  ] could have a positive impact on [PER Karzai  ] , s confidence and quiet concerns about whether the presidential election can be safely held. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG RC-West  ] and [ORG RC-North  ] remain relatively quiet , although [ORG RC-West  ] has become less stable in the past few months . 
A rash of kidnappings in [LOC Herat  ] , combined with a series of insurgent attacks , including at least one that upset public access to basic needs , had resulted in a widespread lack of confidence in local governance . 
The [ORG GIRoA  ] apparently recognized the danger of leaving this key region that borders [LOC Iran  ] ( and will eventually be linked to [LOC Khaf  ] , [LOC Iran  ] by rail service ) open to growing insurgent movements and the appeal of a parallel source of governance . 
MoI Minister Atmar has just sacked a number of senior security officials in [LOC Herat  ] in response to this popular unrest. ------------------------- Afghan-Pak relations ------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( S ) There , s been a sea change in bilateral ties since [PER Musharraf  ] , s exit . 
[PER Karzai  ] and [PER Zardari  ] have warm relations , which has spread to other parts of the bilateral civilian-side relationship . 
We also see promising signs of cooperation on the security side ) increased coordination and communication between the respective security forces along certain parts of the border , and a November meeting in [LOC Islamabad  ] between [ORG NDS  ] Director [PER Saleh  ] and ISI Director General [PER Pasha  ] . 
The two governments also convened a largely symbolic but positive &mini-jirga8 meeting in October . 
Continuing - though reduced - infiltration from the [ORG FATA  ] and the recent [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks have done little , however , to diminish [LOC Afghanistan  ] , s ongoing distrust of the [LOC Pakistan  ] Army and conviction that ISI is supporting rather than countering terrorism. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) We very much look forward to your visit .
