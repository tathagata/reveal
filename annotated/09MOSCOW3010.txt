( C ) Summary: Official [ORG GOR  ] reports and media have pronounced the [MISC Russian-Iranian  ] relationship healthy and Minister of Energy 's [PER Shmatko  ] 's recent visit to [LOC Tehran  ] as a success . 
Privately , [ORG GOR  ] officials and [MISC Russian  ] analysts agree that there are serious tensions in the bilateral relationship such as the [MISC S-300s  ] issue , the [LOC Bushehr  ] project and the possibility of [LOC Russia  ] 's support of sanctions . 
They downplay [LOC Moscow  ] 's ability to influence [LOC Iran  ] , noting competing interests within [LOC Russia  ] that complicate [MISC Russian  ] policy decisions . 
[LOC Iran  ] policy remains a sensitive domestic question . 
End Summary --------------------------- Signaling [LOC Iran  ] on Sanctions --------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC Italian  ] Embassy interlocutors in [LOC Moscow  ] reported that , during his recent visit to [LOC Rome  ] , President [PER Medvedev  ] confided to PM [PER Berlusconi  ] that dealing with [LOC Iran  ] lately had been " frustrating . 
" [PER Medvedev  ] said he was bothered by [LOC Iran  ] 's refusal to accept the [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] ( [ORG TRR  ] ) proposal and that [LOC Iran  ] 's reaction showed a lack of trust for [LOC Russia  ] . 
While [LOC Russia  ] did not necessarily agree that sanctions would be effective , he said , the threat of sanctions could signal [LOC Iran  ] that it was time to change course . 
[PER Medvedev  ] admitted that he did not know who was making decisions in [LOC Tehran  ] now , but he was nevertheless optimistic that there was still some room for negotiation on the [ORG TRR  ] proposal. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Ali Mustafabeily  ] , Deputy for [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] in the [ORG MFA  ] 's Second [ORG Asia Department  ] who accompanied [PER Shmatko  ] to [LOC Iran  ] , told us that it was time to pressure [LOC Iran  ] . 
The [ORG TRR  ] proposal was a fair offer , but there was also a deadline that [LOC Iran  ] had missed . 
Commenting that the [MISC Iranians  ] were " sly " and knew how to negotiate , he said that just last week [PER Saeed Jalili  ] , Secretary of the [LOC Islamic Republic of Iran  ] 's [ORG Supreme National Security Council  ] , had informed the [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador in [LOC Tehran  ] of [LOC Iran  ] 's new thinking on the [ORG TRR  ] proposal . 
If the [LOC West  ] , including [LOC Russia  ] , did not agree to a plan in which the [ORG IAEA  ] would take " possession " of the low enriched uranium ( [ORG LEU  ] ) while it remained on [MISC Iranian  ] soil , it meant the [LOC West  ] did not trust the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
[PER Mustafabeily  ] seemed exasperated by this thinking . 
He also reported that [LOC Iran  ] had conferred with ( unnamed ) other countries and determined that the enrichment proposed in the [ORG TRR  ] proposal could be completed in five months rather than one year . 
[PER Mustafabeily  ] said that [LOC Russia  ] could not accomplish this process in five months , but said it was possible that others could. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Mustafabeily  ] also remarked that he had met many members of the [MISC Iranian  ] diaspora living in [LOC France  ] . 
Most were involved in business and kept one foot in [LOC France  ] and the other in [LOC Iran  ] . 
While uniformly critical of the current [MISC Iranian  ] regime , they also unanimously opposed sanctions as a way to influence [LOC Iran  ] . 
They believed sanctions would only harm average [MISC Iranians  ] , not the elites . 
[PER Mustafabeily  ] reported his own private conversations with businessmen in [LOC Tehran  ] that confirmed this opinion. --------------------------------------- [MISC S-300s: Still Yellow Light  ] on Transfer --------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) On the issue of the [MISC S-300s  ] , [PER Mustafabeily  ] reported that the [MISC Iranians  ] had strongly criticized delays in the sale . 
Specifically , the [MISC Iranian  ] Ministers of [LOC Trade  ] and [ORG Economic Development  ] summoned [PER Shmatko  ] to discuss the [MISC S-300s  ] and threatened legal action against the [ORG GOR  ] to resolve the issue . 
According to [PER Mustafabeily  ] , the [MISC Iranians  ] reminded [PER Shmatko  ] that they had already paid a considerable amount towards delivery of the system and they expected fulfillment of the contract . 
While [LOC Moscow  ] was not considering a refund , [ORG GOR  ] officials recognized the gravity of the issue and that [LOC Tehran  ] was likely waiting for [LOC Russia  ] 's decision on sanctions before carrying out its threat of legal action . 
[PER Baranov  ] said the decision on the [MISC Russian  ] side would be made at the Presidential level , implying that the [ORG MFA  ] was not involved in the discussions . 
He did note that some in the [ORG GOR  ] believed transferring the [MISC S-300s  ] to [LOC Iran  ] would increase stability in the region because [LOC Iran  ] would feel more secure without developing nuclear weapons. ----------------------- [ORG Anti-Russian Mood Grows  ] ----------------------- [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00003010 002 OF 003 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Interestingly , [PER Mustafabeily  ] noticed an anti-Russian feeling in [LOC Iran  ] , even to include unorchestrated demonstrations in front of their embassy in [LOC Tehran  ] . 
He commented that [LOC Russia  ] was being criticized by the government and the elites for being too close to the [LOC West  ] and for voting with [MISC Western  ] countries in the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
Simultaneously , the [MISC Iranian  ] opposition was also condemning [LOC Russia  ] for working with the [MISC Iranian  ] government . 
[PER Mustafabeily  ] complained that the propaganda machine was working at full-speed in [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Maxim Baranov  ] , Director of the [ORG MFA  ] 's [LOC Iran  ] Desk , said that Minister of Energy [PER Shmatko  ] 's visit to [LOC Tehran  ] was a chance to calm [LOC Iran  ] 's concerns about delays at the [LOC Bushehr  ] facility and reduce rising tensions in the relationship . 
He said that [LOC Russia  ] planned to open the [LOC Bushehr  ] reactor as soon as technical tests were completed and that confusion over dates had led to misstatements in the press . 
[PER Baranov  ] claimed that [LOC Russia  ] was continuing with technical testing and did not truly have an expected opening date . 
[PER Baranov  ] acknowledged that [PER Shmatko  ] 's visit came at a difficult time in the bilateral relationship , given [LOC Russia  ] 's recent vote at the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
He noted that , although [LOC Iran  ] was upset about [LOC Russia  ] 's decision , [MISC Iranians  ] would not directly " criticize a guest in their home . 
" As could be expected , [MISC Iranian  ] officials instead expressed their disappointment through the media . 
[PER Baranov  ] explained [LOC Russia  ] 's [ORG IAEA  ] vote as an effort to signal [LOC Iran  ] that [LOC Russia  ] would no longer remain its unconditional supporter . 
He indicated that [LOC Moscow  ] felt deceived by the [LOC Qom  ] site . 
[PER Baranov  ] also took the opportunity to call for the [LOC U.S.  ] to consult more closely with [LOC Russia  ] on [LOC Iran  ] and not limit discussions to like-minded countries. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Baranov  ] claimed there was no clear signal coming from [LOC Tehran  ] about if or when [LOC Iran  ] would negotiate and who was in charge . 
According to [PER Baranov  ] , [LOC Russia  ] wanted [LOC Iran  ] to understand that , while [ORG IAEA  ] Director [PER El Baradei  ] had always tried to remain objective , there was no guarantee that the incoming director would follow this path . 
[PER El Baradei  ] 's proposal was a favorable deal that might not be available after he leaves his position . 
Therefore , [LOC Russia  ] was urging [LOC Iran  ] to begin cooperation with the [ORG IAEA  ] now on the [ORG TRR  ] proposal . 
When asked about Prime Minister [PER Putin  ] 's recent statement that [LOC Russia  ] had no information about a military dimension to [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program , [PER Baranov  ] seemed caught off guard . 
He confided that backing up such a comment would be " complicated work . 
" -------------------------------------- [LOC Iran  ] 's Goal--Capability or Production ? -------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG Russian Academy of Sciences  ] [PER Vladimir Yevseyev  ] claimed that [LOC Russia  ] 's red line with [LOC Iran  ] would be if/when [LOC Iran  ] withdrew from the [ORG IAEA  ] because this would demonstrate that [LOC Iran  ] 's intention was to build a nuclear weapon . 
He believed that , because [LOC Iran  ] was hoping to keep the [ORG LEU  ] on its territory and needed an excuse to back away from the [ORG IAEA  ] , its reaction to the vote was calculated and exaggerated . 
[PER Nina Mamedova  ] of the [ORG Oriental Studies Institute  ] and [PER Zhigun Yefim  ] of the [ORG Middle East Institute  ] agreed that [LOC Iran  ] 's reaction was overly emotional . 
[PER Mamedova  ] claimed that [LOC Iran  ] 's reaction and subsequent announcement of plans to build 10 enrichment sites was meant to leave room for bargaining in the world community . 
[LOC Iran  ] was well known , according to [PER Mamedova  ] , for adopting harsh positions so there would be room for retreat . 
She recalled that six years ago [LOC Iran  ] reacted in the same way to an unfavorable [ORG IAEA  ] resolution and threatened to build 20 nuclear power plants . 
Then , when [LOC Iran  ] realized that the isolation this decision produced was not helpful , it renewed cooperation . 
She predicted that [LOC Iran  ] would likely return to negotiations by early next year but did not know when exactly. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Vladimir Sazhin  ] of the [ORG Oriental Studies Institute  ] and commentator for the [ORG Voice of Russia  ] claimed that [LOC Tehran  ] 's overall goal was completion of the fuel cycle and infrastructure to produce a nuclear weapon when they needed it . 
He did not believe [LOC Tehran  ] intended to assemble a weapon . 
Merely having the capacity would be enough to satisfy its need for security and self-aggrandizement . 
Conversely , both [PER Mamedova  ] and [PER Yefim  ] believed [LOC Iran  ] 's goal was to build a nuclear weapon rather than just develop the capability . 
They believed [LOC Iran  ] would not feel secure until it had a small number of nuclear weapons to defend itself against the " threat " from [LOC Israel.  ] ----------------- Influencing [LOC Iran  ] ----------------- [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00003010 003 OF 003 <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Although [LOC Russia  ] had long considered [LOC Iran  ] as a key element of regional stability , most [MISC Russian  ] officials and analysts agreed that its ability to influence [LOC Iran  ] was minimal and quickly decreasing . 
[PER Yevseyev  ] pointed out that [LOC Italy  ] and [LOC Germany  ] had far greater trade turnover with [LOC Iran  ] than [LOC Russia  ] did . 
Similarly , [PER Mamedova  ] lamented that the bilateral economic relationship was small , even speculating that rumors circulating about [LOC Iran  ] 's readiness to start joint new exploration efforts with [ORG Gazprom  ] of possible gas fields were more likely empty promises meant to convince [LOC Russia  ] to defend [LOC Iran  ] 's position in the international community. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) A carrot/stick approach was recommended by some observers . 
[PER Vladimir Sazhin  ] said that any use of military force against [LOC Iran  ] would cause catastrophe in the region or even globally . 
He advocated balanced measures which included financial support to the oil and gas sector , a treaty between the [ORG P5  ] 1 and [LOC Iran  ] on security guarantees , and recognition of [LOC Iran  ] 's prominent role in the region . 
If these failed to produce positive results , he believed sanctions against the banking and oil and gas sectors might be effective . 
[PER Yevseyev  ] said the international community should remain flexible and strive for [LOC Iran  ] 's integration in to the global economic and political system when [LOC Iran  ] demonstrates behaviors that are more positive . 
[PER Mamedova  ] said it was critical that sanctions avoid inflicting suffering on average [MISC Iranians  ] because this would only increase support for [LOC Iran  ] 's current behavior. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment:  ] The varying perspectives within the [MISC Russian  ] foreign policy establishment reflect competing interests . 
From a purely mercantilist standpoint , sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] , particularly its energy sector , would likely translate into a bump in world oil prices , which would boost annual revenues for [LOC Russia  ] 's state-connected energy companies and the state budget by billions of dollars annually . 
If sanctions harm [LOC Iran  ] 's burgeoning economic relationship with [LOC China  ] , some in [LOC Russia  ] might also regard that as a plus . 
On the other hand , sanctions could damage [LOC Russia  ] 's own trade with [LOC Iran  ] , which is modest ( [LOC Russia  ] currently has a bilateral trade surplus of about USD 3 billion ) but concentrated in the politically-influential defense and atomic-energy sectors . 
Since many high-ranking officials in these agencies also favor a more adversarial policy towards the [LOC West  ] , an anti-sanctions posture serves them both economically and ideologically . 
The status quo is preferable for [LOC Russia  ] and as the decision point approaches [LOC Moscow  ] will probably search for an outcome that changes as little as possible . 
Given the stakes for [LOC Russia  ] 's economy and its relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Israel  ] and the [ORG EU  ] , this decision will be made by both [PER Medvedev  ] and [PER Putin  ] , with implications for the domestic and foreign influence each exerts .
