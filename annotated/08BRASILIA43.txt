( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Summary: The Government of Brazil  ] remains highly sensitive to public claims suggesting that terrorist or extremist organizations have a presence or are undertaking activities in [LOC Brazil--a  ] sensitivity that appears to be the rise and is resulting in more than symbolic reactions . 
At an operational level and away from the public spotlight , however , the [ORG GOB  ] is a cooperative partner in countering terrorism and terrorist-related activities . 
Even though the Argentina-Brazil-Paraguay tri-border area ( [ORG TBA  ] ) exclusively dominates headlines , the primary counterterrorism concern for both [MISC Brazilian  ] officials and the [LOC U.S. Mission  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] is the presence and activities of individuals with links to terrorism--particularly several suspected [PER Sunni extremists  ] and some individuals linked to Hizballah--in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] and other areas of southern [LOC Brazil  ] . 
To a lesser extent , the [ORG TBA  ] remains a concern , primarily for the potential that terrorists may exploit conditions there--including lax border controls , smuggling , drug trafficking , easy access to false documents and weapons , movement of pirated goods , uncontrolled cash flows--to raise funds or arrange logistics for operations . 
Post will focus over the coming year on keeping the higher levels of the [MISC Brazilian  ] government engaged politically and diplomatically on [LOC CT  ] objectives , and on seeking to ensure that they do not undermine the productive partnerships at the operational level . 
End Summary. ---------------------------- Policy-Level Sensitivities ------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [MISC Brazilian  ] government is a cooperative partner in countering terrorism and terrorist-related activity in [LOC Brazil--to  ] include investigating potential terrorism financing , document forgery networks , and other illicit activity--that could contribute to the facilitation of attacks in the region or elsewhere . 
Nonetheless , the highest levels of the [MISC Brazilian  ] government , particularly the [ORG Ministry of Foreign Relations  ] , are extremely sensitive to any public claims that terrorists have a presence in Brazil--whether to raise funds , arrange logistics , or even transit through the country--and will vigorously reject any statements implying otherwise . 
This sensitivity results , in part , from their fear of stigmatizing the large [MISC Muslim  ] community of [LOC Brazil  ] ( estimated , but unconfirmed , by some sources at over 1 million ) or prejudicing the area 's image as a tourist destination . 
It is also a public posture designed to avoid being too closely linked to what is seen as the [LOC US  ] 's overly aggressive War on Terrorism . 
This sensitivity manifests itself in various symbolic and concrete ways. -- ( C ) The [ORG GOB  ] participates reluctantly in the " 3 1 [ORG Mechanism on Security  ] in the [LOC Triborder Area  ] , " which annually gathers diplomatic , law enforcement , and intelligence representatives of the three [MISC Triborder  ] ( [ORG TBA  ] ) countries together with the [LOC U.S.  ] to deliberate strategies to deter a host of transnational criminal activities that could be exploited by potential terrorists to facilitate attacks . 
At the conferences , the [MISC Brazilian  ] delegations often decry statements made by [LOC U.S.  ] officials claiming that the [ORG TBA  ] is a hotbed of terrorist activity and challenge [LOC U.S.  ] participants to present the evidence on which [LOC U.S.  ] officials base those statements . 
[ORG Itamaraty  ] officials repeatedly question the value of this four-way cooperation , insisting that " bilateral concerns should be addressed bilaterally " ( reftel ) . -- ( U ) The [ORG GOB  ] refuses to legally or even rhetorically label [MISC U.S.-designated  ] terrorist groups such as [ORG HAMAS  ] , [ORG Hizballah  ] or the [ORG FARC  ] as terrorist groups--the former two being considered by [LOC Brazil  ] as legitimate political parties . 
As a result , their threshold for accepting evidence of terrorism financing [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000043 002 OF 004 activity in the region , at least publicly , is very high and any information indicating that individuals in the [ORG TBA  ] send funds to the groups in [LOC Lebanon  ] , in their view , does not necessarily constitute an activity supporting terrorism. -- ( U ) At the diplomatic level , the [ORG GOB  ] has twice refused to officially endorse [LOC Argentina  ] 's claims that the perpetrators of the 1994 terrorism attack in [LOC Buenos Aires  ] may have received support from individuals in the [ORG TBA  ] by abstaining from voting in favor of issuing [ORG Interpol  ] capture notices for the 5 [MISC Iranian  ] and 1 [MISC Lebanese  ] national suspected of involvement in the attack. -- ( U ) Two key [MISC CT-related  ] legislative initiatives continue to languish . 
Neither the anti-terrorism nor the anti-money laundering legislation has been introduced to [ORG Congress  ] , despite both being ready for more than a year . 
If passed , the bills would establish the crime of terrorism and associated activities and would facilitate greater law enforcement access to financial and banking records during investigations , criminalize illicit enrichment , allow administrative freezing of assets , and facilitate prosecutions of money laundering cases by amending the legal definition of money laundering and making it an autonomous offense. --------------------------------------- Combined with [ORG Operational Cooperation  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Despite negative rhetoric in [ORG Itamaraty  ] and at higher levels of the [ORG GOB  ] , [MISC Brazilian  ] law enforcement and intelligence agencies--principally the [ORG Federal Police  ] , Customs , the [ORG Brazilian Intelligence Agency  ] ( [ORG ABIN  ] ) , and others--are aware of the potential threat from terrorists exploiting the favorable conditions existing in [LOC Brazil  ] to operate and actively track and monitor suspected terrorist activity and follow all leads passed to them . 
The [ORG Federal Police  ] will often arrest individuals with links to terrorism , but will charge them on a variety of non-terrorism related crimes to avoid calling attention of the media and the higher levels of the government . 
Over the past year the [ORG Federal Police  ] has arrested various individuals engaged in suspected terrorism financing activity but have based their arrests on narcotics and customs charges. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) [LOC Brazil  ] is capable of monitoring domestic financial operations and effectively utilizes its financial intelligence unit , the [ORG Financial Activities Oversight Council  ] ( [ORG COAF  ] ) , to identify possible funding sources for terrorist groups . 
The [ORG GoB  ] has carried out name checks for persons and entities on the [ORG UNSCR  ] 1267 and 1373 terror finance lists , but has so far not found any assets , accounts or property in the names of persons or entities on the [ORG UN  ] terror-finance lists . 
[LOC Brazil  ] also established [ORG National Strategy to Combat Money Laundering  ] ( [ORG ENCLA  ] ) and is creating a data base called the [ORG Electronic Declaration of Cash Carriage  ] ( [ORG EDPV  ] ) , which will assist in monitoring individuals who transfer funds abroad . 
Although the system is a prototype and is still being tested , [MISC Brazilian  ] law enforcement officials are encouraged by initial results. --------------------------------------------- --------------- Primary Concern: Individuals Linked to Terrorism in [LOC Southern Brazil  ] --------------------------------------------- --------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The primary counterterrorism concern for both [MISC Brazilian  ] officials and the [ORG U.S. Mission  ] in [LOC Brazil  ] is the presence and activities of individuals with links to terrorism--particularly several suspected [MISC Sunni  ] extremists and some individuals linked to Hizballah--in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] and other areas of southern [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The [ORG Federal Police  ] , and to a lesser extent [ORG ABIN  ] , monitor the activities of these suspected extremists who may be tied to terrorist groups abroad and [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000043 003 OF 004 share this information with their [LOC U.S.  ] counterparts. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Brazilian  ] law enforcement officials actively monitor the presence of several suspected [MISC Sunni  ] extremists with possible ties to terrorist groups abroad who may be capable of lending logistical support--through financing , safehaven , false travel documents-- for terrorist attacks in the region or abroad . 
In 2007 , the [ORG Federal Police  ] arrested a potential [MISC Sunni  ] extremist terrorist facilitator operating primarily in [LOC Santa Catarina  ] state for failure to declare funds entering the country and is in the process of deporting him . 
Also in 2007 , [ORG Brazilian Federal Police  ] took down a Rio de [MISC Janeiro-based  ] false document ring that was supplying falsified [MISC Brazilian  ] documents to non-Brazilians , among them suspected international drug traffickers. --------------------------------------------- -------------- Secondary Concern: Argentina-Brazil-Paraguay [LOC Tri-Border Area  ] --------------------------------------------- -------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) To a lesser extent , the [ORG TBA  ] remains a concern for the [LOC U.S. Mission  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] counterparts , primarily for the potential that terrorists may exploit the favorable conditions there--lax border controls , smuggling , drug trafficking , easy access to false documents and weapons , movement of pirated goods , uncontrolled cash flows--to raise funds or arrange logistics for operations . 
While there are some individuals suspected of having links to [ORG Hizballah  ] and [ORG HAMAS  ] , there is little evidence these groups have an operational terrorist presence in the region . 
According to [MISC Brazilian  ] security service sources , the [MISC Muslim  ] presence in [LOC Foz  ] do Iguacu represents a very small percentage of the [MISC Muslim  ] population in [LOC Brazil  ] , and even those who provide some financial support to the groups have little or no connection to them . 
The [ORG GOB  ] pursues [LOC CT  ] investigations in the [ORG TBA  ] and shares the results of their investigations , but their principal concern remains the array of other transnational criminal activity that takes place in the region . 
The area is a major entry point for drug traffickers into [LOC Brazil  ] . 
In addition , it is a focus of concern for [LOC Brazil  ] in other areas such as arms trafficking , smuggling of pirated and counterfeit goods , as well as money laundering and terrorist financing. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) To cover this range of transnational criminal activity , the [ORG GOB  ] 's police and intelligence services have an extensive presence in the region and liaison relationships with [MISC Argentine  ] , [MISC Paraguayan  ] , and other national intelligence services , including USG agencies . 
Furthermore , the [ORG GOB  ] has attempted to institutionalize some of this cross-border cooperation , although with mixed success . 
For example , [MISC Brazilian  ] Customs completed a new inspection station at the [LOC Friendship Bridge  ] in the [ORG TBA  ] . 
This should enable the [ORG GOB  ] to intensify its crack down on contraband crossing the bridge , though law enforcement officials expect that traffickers will respond to the tough controls by trying to move their goods clandestinely across the border elsewhere via boat . 
[LOC Brazil  ] also conducts maritime patrols on their side of the [ORG Itaipu Lake  ] to deter smuggling activity , although resource constraints and lack of equipment hampers their effectiveness . 
The long-standing goal of conducting joint patrols with the [MISC Paraguayans  ] remains elusive . 
Finally , in order to more effectively combat trans-border criminal organizations with its neighbors , [LOC Brazil  ] established a joint intelligence center ( [ORG JIC  ] ) in the [ORG TBA  ] , but staffing issues have hampered its operations , and it is not apparent that the [ORG GOB  ] has pushed the other countries too vigorously to send representatives. ----------- Comment: ----------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Operational  ] elements of the various [MISC Brazilian  ] security and law enforcement agencies understand that the [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000043 004 OF 004 full scope of the problem goes beyond the [ORG TBA  ] , and is almost certainly more significant in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] and other parts of [LOC Brazil  ] . 
However , the constant barrage of terrorism-related media coverage regarding the [ORG TBA  ] tends to heighten [ORG GOB  ] sensitivities , and particularly those of [ORG Itamaraty  ] , increasing their reluctance to countenance any claims that terrorists could possibly have a presence in any part of [LOC Brazil  ] . 
While this sensitivity generally manifests itself in nothing more than public rebukes of declarations by [LOC U.S.  ] officials and sniping during meetings by [ORG Itamaraty  ] officials , it does occasionally result in more than symbolic reactions by the [ORG GOB  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG AMIA  ] abstention at [ORG Interpol  ] , reversal on [LOC CT  ] legislation , and inflexibility on 3 1 all represent concrete challenges to local law enforcement officials and regional partners in advancing [LOC CT  ] cooperation . 
Post will focus over the coming year on keeping the higher levels of the [MISC Brazilian  ] government engaged politically and diplomatically on this issue , and on seeking to ensure that they do not undermine the work being done at the operational level .
