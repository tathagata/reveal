( C ) SUMMARY: [LOC Bulgaria  ] has decided to approve the sale of arms from a private [MISC Bulgarian  ] firm to the Government of [LOC Yemen  ] . 
The deal , funded by the [LOC UAE  ] and worth approximately USD 55 million , will send small arms , explosives , ammunition , and other weaponry to [LOC Yemen  ] in the first half of 2010 . 
In light of the increasingly unstable situation in [LOC Yemen  ] , and in response to our proposal for greater end-use monitoring , the [ORG Bulgarian Export Commission  ] agreed to take extra steps to ensure proper delivery , storage , and accountability for the shipments , which began on January 5 . 
The [ORG Export Commission  ] passed on identification numbers for all items and stated that [LOC Bulgaria  ] will comply with a USG proposal for additional monitoring , as well as coordinated efforts with their embassy in [LOC Yemen  ] to heighten safeguards for proper delivery . 
Although not mandatory , [LOC Bulgaria  ] continues to consult with us on an informal basis on arms deals involving potentially controversial destinations . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Bulgaria’s Export Commission  ] notified us on November 7 that it was considering approval of a deal , financed by the [LOC UAE  ] that would send over 30,000 assault rifles , 100,000 high-explosive charges , RPGs , and ammunition to [LOC Yemen  ] from the [MISC Bulgarian  ] consignee [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] in the first part of 2010 . 
At that time , we expressed our reservations about the deal , given the unstable situation in [LOC Yemen  ] and the potential for proliferation of small arms . 
Although it accepted our concerns , the [ORG Export Commission  ] decided to go ahead with the deal , noting that the difficult economic situation made the offer extremely attractive to domestic arms producers . 
Anticipating this , we proposed a set of measures to enhance end-use monitoring . 
The [ORG MOEE  ] agreed to reduce the quantity of assualt rifles by 25 per cent and provide serial numbers , lot numbers , and production years for nearly all of the items . 
The [ORG Ministry of Energy and Economy  ] also received a statement of compliance from the GoY regarding delivery , description of goods , and storage requirements . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] provided us with delivery schedule documents , including flight information for the [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] scheduled air shipments between [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
This information was passed through intel channels . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also gave us a CD containing lot numbers and serial numbers . 
Noting their good contacts on the ground in [LOC Yemen  ] , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] informed us that [ORG Bulgaria’s Commercial Attache  ] is expected to be present for all deliveries. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) COMMENT: The [MISC Bulgarian  ] government continues to work closely with us to prevent arms proliferation . 
As a rule , they seek our advice on potentially controversial cases , even when our consultation is not mandatory . 
In the past , the GoB has denied arms deals to countries of concern , such as [LOC Eritrea  ] , based on our objections . 
In this instance , the financial incentive was too great for them to refuse . 
But , they are committed to working with us on all possible end-use monitoring steps . 
Copies of the [ORG E.U.C.  ] and the lot and serial numbers have been sent by SIPRnet to ISN/CATR [PER Margaret Mitchell  ] .
