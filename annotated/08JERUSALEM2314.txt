[ORG PA  ] Commanders Urge [ORG IDF  ] to Avoid Use of [MISC Live Ammunition  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG PA  ] commanders complained about [ORG IDF  ] use of live ammunition , responsible for three [MISC Palestinian  ] fatalities in December 27-28 protests . 
[ORG MG  ] [PER Ali  ] said [ORG IDF  ] commanders told them live ammunition is the last resort when dealing with [MISC Palestinian  ] demonstrators , and [ORG IDF  ] rules of engagement only authorize it when the lives of [ORG IDF  ] soldiers or [MISC Israeli  ] citizens are at immediate risk . 
[ORG PA  ] security chiefs said [ORG IDF  ] BG [PER Tibon  ] reported that the [LOC Nil'in  ] village shooting ( in which two [MISC Palestinian  ] were killed by [ORG IDF  ] fire ) was quickly investigated by the [ORG IDF  ] , and that an [ORG IDF  ] officer has already been referred to a disciplinary board for improper use of live ammunition during the incident . 
According to [ORG MG  ] [PER Ali  ] , both [PER BGs Tibon  ] and [PER Mordechai  ] said they re-issued instructions to all forces operating in the [LOC West Bank  ] to abide strictly by rules of engagement and refrain from using live rounds against unarmed demonstrators. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG MG  ] [PER Ali  ] added that [ORG IDF  ] commanders said that in the [LOC Silwad  ] incidents the [MISC Palestinian  ] was about to throw a firebomb , thus endangering soldiers' lives , and that according to [ORG IDF  ] rules of engagement [MISC Palestinians  ] with firebombs are a threat to life and can be engaged with live ammunition . 
He added that both [ORG IDF  ] commanders agreed , however , that in most cases , even demonstrators with firebombs should not be engaged , and troops should find non-lethal means of controlling the situation . 
Both Sides Agree to [LOC Increase Coordination  ] ----------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) According to [ORG PA  ] security chiefs , the second part of the meeting was dedicated to a review the [LOC West Bank  ] security situation . 
[ORG PA  ] commanders said they told [ORG IDF  ] officers that President [PER Abbas  ] and PM [PER Fayyad  ] both directed them to avoid situations that could develop into confrontations with the [ORG IDF  ] . 
The security chiefs said [PER Abbas  ] and [PER Fayyad  ] passed a message to all [MISC Palestinian  ] factions , at a [ORG PLO Executive Committee  ] meeting on December 29 , that only peaceful marches away from flashpoints would be permitted . 
[ORG PA  ] commanders noted they have no control on over B/C areas such as [LOC Qalandiya  ] and [LOC Nil'in  ] , and would need [ORG IDF  ] approval to move [ORG PA  ] forces to those areas to prevent clashes between protesters and the [ORG IDF  ] . 
[ORG PA  ] commanders said both sides agreed that [LOC Hebron  ] is a problem , and cooperation on a case-by-case basis is critical . 
[ORG PA  ] commanders said their [ORG IDF  ] counterparts agreed to expedite coordination and movement requests and exchange information on possible disturbances , as both sides have an interest in preventing [LOC West Bank  ] violence . 
They said both sides also agreed not to leak substantive discussions about the meeting to the press , given the sensitivity of [LOC JERUSALEM  ] 00002314 002 OF 002 [MISC PA-GOI  ] security coordination in a time of [MISC Palestinian  ] outrage over events in [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[PER Fayyad  ] Confirms MoD Contacts ---------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 .
