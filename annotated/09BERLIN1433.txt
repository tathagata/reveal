MURPHY  ] . 
REASONS: 1.4 ( B ) AND ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY . 
[ORG Chancellery National Security Advisor  ] [PER Christoph Heusgen  ] told [ORG EUR A/S  ] [PER Phil Gordon  ] and Ambassador [PER Murphy  ] in a November 10 meeting in [LOC Berlin  ] that [LOC Germany  ] strongly preferred that the proposed international conference on [LOC Afghanistan  ] be held outside the country to make it easier to press [PER Karzai  ] to commit to the necessary reforms . 
On the [LOC Middle East  ] , [PER Heusgen  ] thought [PER Netanyahu  ] had to do much more on settlements if there was to be any hope of re-starting negotiations . 
On [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Heusgen  ] hoped for some conclusion by early next month on whether the diplomatic track was going to bear fruit so that this issue could be discussed at the December 10 [ORG EU  ] Summit . 
[PER Heusgen  ] said [LOC Germany  ] was ready to discuss taking Guantanamo detainees , but stressed the importance of dealing directly with the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] and keeping the negotiations confidential . 
While arguing for being rhetorically supportive of the [ORG Medvedev European Security  ] proposal , [PER Heusgen  ] shared [LOC U.S.  ] skepticism about a new treaty and an [ORG OSCE  ] Summit hosted by [LOC Kazakhstan  ] . 
[PER Heusgen  ] distanced the [ORG Chancellery  ] from the proposal to remove all remaining tactical nuclear weapons from [LOC Germany  ] , stressing the need to get reciprocal cuts from the [MISC Russians  ] . 
Also discussed was [ORG CFE  ] , the [MISC Macedonian  ] name issue and [LOC Bosnia  ] . 
END SUMMARY . 
[LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Heusgen  ] confirmed that [LOC Germany  ] would only announce additional resources for [LOC Afghanistan  ] after the proposed international conference , which Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] and [LOC UK  ] PM Brown are now proposing for January 28 in [LOC London  ] . 
He said the conference is key because this is where the [MISC Germans  ] expect the [MISC Afghan  ] government to make specific commitments to improve governance and to gradually begin assuming responsibility from the international community . 
President [PER Karzai  ] had to be put under international pressure to perform according to prescribed benchmarks . 
Toward that end , the [ORG Chancellery  ] felt strongly that the conference should be held outside of [LOC Afghanistan  ] and not on [PER Karzai  ] 's " home turf . 
" [PER Heusgen  ] complained that the [MISC German  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] embassies in [LOC Kabul  ] are on " a different track " and pushing for a conference in [LOC Kabul  ] . 
It was important to " make up our minds " quickly on the way ahead . 
If the conference slipped to February or later , and the [LOC UK  ] were no longer able to host it in view of the upcoming parliamentary elections there , then [LOC Germany  ] would be willing to. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Heusgen  ] at first expressed concern that the [LOC U.S.  ] would undermine international leverage on [PER Karzai  ] by rolling out its new strategy and resource commitments before he made any reciprocal commitments to reform . 
[PER Gordon  ] assured him that the formal [LOC U.S.  ] roll-out would only come after the November 19 inauguration , where [PER Karzai  ] is expected to " say the right things " in his inaugural address . 
[PER Gordon  ] also highlighted the need to coordinate on the [LOC U.S.  ] roll-out to avoid the perception that the [LOC U.S.  ] was " Americanizing " the international effort in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
It should be announced as a common strategy and not as a [LOC U.S.  ] strategy to which the [MISC Allies  ] then respond . 
[PER Heusgen  ] agreed in principle , but indicated that [LOC Germany  ] would stick to its approach of holding back on any announcement of new commitments until after the international conference . 
[LOC MIDDLE EAST  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Referring to the Secretary 's recent public statements on settlements , [PER Heusgen  ] said that [LOC Germany  ] " perceives this differently " and thought [PER Netanyahu  ] needed " to do more " in order bring the [MISC Palestinians  ] to the negotiating table . 
With [MISC Palestinians  ] in [LOC East Jerusalem  ] getting notices from [MISC Israeli  ] authorities that their houses will be destroyed , it would be " suicide " for President [PER Abbas  ] to move under the current circumstances . 
[PER Heusgen  ] said he could not fathom why [PER Netanyahu  ] did not understand this . 
He suggested pressuring [PER Netanyahu  ] by linking favorable [ORG UNSC  ] treatment of the [ORG Goldstone Report  ] to [LOC Israel  ] committing to a complete stop in settlement activity . 
[PER Gordon  ] said that making a direct linkage between the two would almost certainly be counterproductive , but agreed that it was worth pointing out to the [MISC Israelis  ] that their policy on settlements was making it difficult for their friends to hold the line in the [ORG UNSC  ] . 
[PER Heusgen  ] said this certainly would be an issue when [PER Netanyahu  ] and " half of his cabinet " visit [LOC Berlin  ] on November 30 for bilateral government consultations . 
[LOC IRAN  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Heusgen  ] praised the [LOC U.S.  ] for its patience with [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC BERLIN  ] 00001433 002 OF 003 but noted that at some point , it would be necessary to move to the second track in order to maintain credibility . 
[PER Heusgen  ] said that he and his [MISC British  ] counterpart agreed that ideally , there would be some conclusion on this by early next month so that the way ahead could be discussed by [ORG EU  ] leaders at their summit on December 10 . 
[PER Gordon  ] agreed that there had to be a time limit , noting that President [PER Obama  ] had given the [MISC Iranians  ] " by the end of the year " to respond favorably . 
He also noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] could support a [MISC Turkish  ] role in the proposed exchange of low-enriched uranium for reactor fuel if that would make it easier for [LOC Iran  ] to accept the deal . 
[PER Gordon  ] indicated , however , that [MISC Turkish  ] PM [MISC Erdogan  ] needed to be careful about losing credibility in [LOC Washington  ] if he continued to make comments about [PER Ahmadinejad  ] being his " friend . 
" GUANTANAMO DETAINEES <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Heusgen  ] noted that now that the [MISC Bundestag  ] election was past , [LOC Germany  ] was ready to help on detainees , as it had promised earlier . 
He advised the [ORG USG  ] to work directly with new Interior Minister [PER de Maiziere  ] , rather than going first to [ORG MFA  ] and the [ORG Chancellery  ] , which had irritated [PER de Maiziere  ] 's predecessor and made him less willing to cooperate . 
In this regard , he thought that it would be helpful if DHS Secretary [PER Napolitano  ] made direct contact with de [PER Maiziere  ] . 
[PER Heusgen  ] also suggested that the discussions be kept confidential until MOI had come to a decision on which detainees to accept and in which state they would be settled . 
Premature public disclosure could doom the whole initiative . 
[PER Heusgen  ] said that Uighurs would be " too difficult , " but that [LOC Germany  ] could probably accept " 2-3 others . 
" ( [MISC Comment:  ] The reluctance about Uighurs is due to the expected negative reaction of the [MISC Chinese  ] government . 
End Comment . 
) [ORG EUROPEAN SECURITY PROPOSAL AND POSSIBLE OSCE  ] SUMMIT <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Heusgen  ] said that while the [LOC West  ] should try to react positively to whatever the [MISC Russians  ] propose in advancing the [ORG Medvedev European  ] security proposal , nothing should be accepted that would undermine current [MISC European  ] security institutions , including the [ORG OSCE  ] . 
He shared [PER Gordon  ] 's misgivings about a proposed treaty . 
He was also skeptical about the idea of an [LOC OSCE Summit  ] in [LOC Astana  ] , agreeing that [LOC Kazakhstan  ] 's human rghts record and the lack of substantive agenda items made it unattractive . 
[PER Heusgen  ] suggested that an [LOC OSCE Summit  ] be offered to the [MISC Russians  ] on the condition they solve the frozen conflict in [LOC Transnistria  ] , which he said [LOC Moscow  ] could accomplish " in about a month . 
" TACTICAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) In response to [PER Gordon  ] 's question about how the government planned to take forward the commitment in the coalition agreement to seek the removal of all remaining nuclear weapons from [LOC Germany  ] , [PER Heusgen  ] distanced the [ORG Chancellery  ] from the proposal , claiming that this had been forced upon them by FM [MISC Westerwelle  ] . 
[PER Heusgen  ] said that from his perspective , it made no sense to unilaterally withdraw " the 20 " tactical nuclear weapons still in [LOC Germany  ] while [LOC Russia  ] maintains " thousands " of them . 
It would only be worth it if both sides drew down . 
[PER Gordon  ] noted that it was important to think through all the potential consequences of the [MISC German  ] proposal before going forward . 
For example , a withdrawal of nuclear weapons from [LOC Germany  ] and perhaps from [LOC Belgium  ] and the [LOC Netherlands  ] could make it very difficult politically for [LOC Turkey  ] to maintain its own stockpile , even though it was still convinced of the need to do so . 
CFE <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Gordon  ] asked for [PER Heusgen  ] 's views on a [MISC German  ] CFE paper that had been delivered to the [ORG State Department  ] just a few days earlier . 
[PER Heusgen  ] said he did not know anything about it , claiming that he did not follow this issue closely or " believe in it . 
" He noted that [ORG MFA  ] " loved this disarmament business , " which was okay , but it had to be balanced or the " [MISC Russians  ] will sit there and laugh . 
" [MISC MACEDONIAN  ] NAME ISSUE <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Gordon  ] briefed [PER Heusgen  ] on the current state of the negotiations , noting that the two key issues were the geographic modifier and international usage . 
[PER Heusgen  ] noted that the Chancellor knew PM [MISC Macedonian  ] Gruevski through their common membership in the [ORG European People 's Party  ] and would be willing to engage him on this issue if that would be helpful . 
[LOC BOSNIA  ] [LOC BERLIN  ] 00001433 003 OF 003 <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Heusgen  ] revealed that [MISC Serb  ] President [PER Tadic  ] was coming to [LOC Berlin  ] the week of November 16 for consultations . 
He noted that while [PER Tadic  ] always claimed to be tough on [LOC Republika Srpska  ] PM Dodic , he needed to be tougher . 
While expressing pessimism about whether it would ever be possible to turn [LOC Bosnia  ] into a " working state , " [PER Heusgen  ] agreed it was important to keep trying .
