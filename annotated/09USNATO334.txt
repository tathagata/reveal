( U ) The text of [PER Rasmussen  ] 's roadmap for the new [ORG Strategic Concept  ] is outlined below: - BEGIN TEXT - A ROADMAP FOR THE NEW STRATEGIC CONCEPT At the [ORG NATO Summit  ] in [LOC Strasbourg/Kehl  ] on 4 April 2009 , Heads of [MISC States  ] and Government ( HoSG ) tasked the Secretary General to develop a new [ORG NATO Strategic Concept  ] . 
This exercise should be completed by the time of [ORG NATO  ] 's next [ORG Summit  ] which is expected to take place in [LOC Lisbon  ] in late 2010 . 
The [MISC Summit  ] also tasked the Secretary General to convene and lead a broad based group of qualified experts who will lay the ground for the new [ORG Strategic Concept  ] . 
This will be done with the active involvement of the [ORG North Atlantic Council  ] ( [ORG NAC  ] ) . 
GUIDING PRINCIPLES [ORG NATO  ] 's current strategic concept dates back to 1999 . 
A sound transatlantic consensus on a new [ORG NATO  ] strategy is an indispensable element of the [ORG Alliance  ] 's strategic adaptation . 
The [ORG Strategic Concept  ] is a central piece of [ORG NATO  ] 's acquis . 
Politically , it occupies place second only to the [LOC Washington Treaty  ] . 
This calls for an inclusive and participatory approach from the biggest to the smallest [PER Ally  ] . 
Moreover , the process should engage Partners in the [ORG Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council  ] , the [ORG Mediterranean Dialogue  ] and the [ORG Istanbul Cooperation Initiative  ] as well as partners across the globe . 
Furthermore , the process should be transparent and engage other key international actors such as the [ORG EU  ] and [ORG UN  ] as well as other types of [ORG NATO  ] interlocutors , like [ORG NGOs  ] . 
Finally , an interactive dialogue with the broader public is encouraged . 
To this end , a web-page dedicated to the process leading to the new [ORG Strategic Concept  ] has been established . 
THE GROUP OF EXPERTS In order to facilitate the working process , the Secretary General has today appointed a broad based Group of Experts . 
The 12 group members have been appointed in their personal capacities . 
The Group of Experts includes a broad spectrum of large and small [ORG NATO  ] members and offers a balanced combination of insiders and outsiders , including from the private sector , think tanks and the academic community . 
Dr. [PER Madeleine Albright  ] , former [MISC US  ] Secretary of State , will chair the Group of Experts with Mr. [PER Jeroen van der Veer  ] , former CEO in [ORG Royal Dutch  ] shell , as vice-chair . 
To ensure close coordination between the Group of Experts and [ORG NATO Headquarters  ] , the Secretary General has designated a small [ORG NATO  ] team led by Dr. [PER Jamie Shea  ] , head of [ORG Policy Planning Unit  ] , to function as a secretariat and staff support . 
A THREE-PHASED APPROACH The process leading to a new [ORG Strategic Concept  ] will have three distinct phases: a reflection phase through a series of seminars ; a consultation phase with allied capitals ; and a drafting and final negotiation phase . 
[ORG USNATO  ] 00000334 003 OF 004 Reflection phase: A series of seminars hosted by individual allies will take place in order to enhance the strategic debate . 
The seminars will engage all stakeholders and relevant players - Permanent Representatives , Military Representatives , [ORG NATO Strategic Commands  ] , the [ORG Military Committee  ] , officials from capitals , strategic thinkers and partners as appropriate . 
Each seminar will cover a specific aspect of the [ORG Strategic Concept.  ] - One seminar will look at [ORG NATO  ] 's core tasks and functions: the meaning of collective defence and deterrence in today 's environment ; how to confront broader spectrum of threats to our populations ; [ORG NATO  ] 's role in disarmament , arms control , and non-proliferation. - Another seminar will look at [ORG NATO  ] as a part of a network of security actors in contributing to global civil and military crisis management and [ORG NATO  ] 's likely tasks with a view to enhancing cooperation with international organizations and NGOs. - A third seminar will look at [ORG NATO  ] and the [MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] security environment ; [ORG NATO  ] 's role in building security in the [MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] area , enlargement and [ORG NATO  ] 's partnerships including relations with [LOC Russia.  ] - A fourth seminar will look at forces and capabilities , including defence planning and transformation . 
IT will also look at procurement at a time of increased financial constraints - that requires flexibility and prioritization . 
The Group of Experts may also , as appropriate , explore other relevant topics . 
The Group of Experts will start its work on 4 September when the Secretary General convenes an informal meeting with [ORG NAC  ] for an initial exchange of vies . 
The Group of Experts will meet periodically with the Secretary General and will submit a progress report in time for the Foreign Ministers meeting in December 2009 . 
Consultation phase: Following the seminars , experts will visit Allied capitals to discuss their findings and proposals with governments , and where possible , parliamentary committees . 
Public outreach events could be organized on these occasions by the capitals concerned . 
In April 2010 the Group of Experts should present their analysis and recommendations to the Secretary General . 
Based on the experts' analysis and recommendations and [MISC Allies'  ] initial reactions the Secretary General will produce his own report on elements in a new [ORG Strategic Concept  ] . 
It will be submitted to governments and- before the summer holiday - the Secretary General will collect political guidance on the drafting of the new [ORG Strategic Concept  ] . 
Drafting and final negotiation phase: After the summer 2010 the Secretary General will prepare his draft of the concept , and he will meet with Permanent Representatives to discuss the evolving drafts . 
Finally , the [ORG USNATO  ] 00000334 004 OF 004 Secretary General will present his [ORG Strategic Concept  ] text to the [ORG NATO  ] summit expected to be held in the autumn of 2010 . 
After approval by HoSG it henceforth becomes [ORG NATO  ] 's new [ORG Strategic Concept  ] . 
END TEXT <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) COMMENT: In the press conference announcing these decisions , [PER Rasmussen  ] gave a strong impression that he sees the new [ORG Strategic Concept  ] as a project to be executed clearly under his leadership and that he intends to control the process . 
He made clear that the chosen experts will participate in their individual ( not national ) capacities and that they answer to him . 
At the same time , he demonstrated his appreciation for the public dimension of this exercise , launching a public program of consultation to that effect . 
He suggested a hands-on approach by stating that he will conduct town halls in Allied capitals to listen to those from all walks of life .
