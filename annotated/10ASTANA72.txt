( S ) SUMMARY: During a private dinner , [ORG KazMunaiGaz First Vice  ] President [PER Maksat Idenov  ] named , in his view , the four most powerful gate-keepers around President [PER Nursultan Nazarbayev: Chief  ] of [ORG Administration and General Services  ] of the President 's Office [PER Sarybai Kalmurzayev  ] , the President 's Chief of Staff [PER Aslan Musin  ] , State Secretary-Foreign Minister [PER Kanat Saudabayev  ] , and the tandem of Prime Minister [PER Karim Masimov  ] and [PER Nazarbayev  ] 's billionaire son-in-law [PER Timur Kulibayev  ] . 
According to [PER Idenov  ] , in [LOC Kazakhstan  ] , market economy means capitalism , which means big money , which means large bribes for the best connected . 
The following details are a single snapshot of one version of current reality . 
The significant point is that [PER Nazarbayev  ] is standing with [PER Idenov  ] , not [PER Kulibayev  ] , to maintain international standards to develop the massive [MISC Kashagan  ] and [MISC Karachaganak  ] hydrocarbon projects . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) On January 21 , [ORG KazMunaiGaz First Vice  ] President [PER Maksat Idenov  ] and the Ambassador had a one-on-one dinner in a nearly empty restaurant ( times are still hard ! ) at the [LOC Radisson  ] hotel in [LOC Astana  ] . 
When the Ambassador arrived , [PER Idenov  ] was barking into his cell phone , " [PER Mark  ] , [PER Mark  ] , stop the excuses ! 
[PER Mark  ] , listen to me ! 
[PER Mark  ] , shut up right now and do as I say ! 
Bring the letter to my office at 10:00 pm , and we will go together to take it to ( Minister of Energy and [ORG Mineral Resources  ] , [ORG MEMR  ] ) Mynbayev at his house . 
" On ending the call , [PER Idenov  ] explained he was talking to [MISC British  ] Gas ( [ORG BG  ] ) Country Director for [LOC Kazakhstan  ] [PER Mark Rawlings  ] who had missed the deadline to deliver a letter about arbitration on the [MISC Karachaganak  ] super-giant oil-field project ( reftel ) . 
Still clearly steamed , [PER Idenov  ] alleged , " He 's still playing games with [ORG Mercator  ] 's [PER James Giffin  ] , " the notorious [MISC AmCit  ] fixer indicted for large-scale bribery on oil deals in the 1990s , whose case drags on in the [ORG Southern District Court  ] of [LOC New York  ] . 
" I tell him , 'Mark , stop being an idiot ! 
Stop tempting fate ! 
Stop communicating with an indicted criminal ! 
' " [PER Idenov  ] asked , " Do you know how much he ( [PER Rawlings  ] ) makes ? $72,000 a month ! 
A month ! ! 
Plus benefits ! 
Plus bonuses ! 
Lives in [LOC Switzerland  ] but supposedly works in [LOC London  ] . 
Comes here once a month to check in . 
[LOC Nice  ] life , huh ? 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [PER Idenov  ] calmed down and said , " Let 's look at the menus . 
" Then he immediately started typing on his [ORG PDA  ] and turned the screen toward the Ambassador , saying , " Let 's look at the 'four courses.' 
" On the screen were four names: [PER Kalmurzayev  ] , [PER Musin  ] , [PER Saudabayev  ] , and [MISC Masimov-Kulibayev  ] . 
" [PER Idenov  ] said , " The [MISC Big Four  ] around [MISC Number One  ] . 
" ( NOTE: [PER Sarybai Kalmurzayev  ] , currently the head of [ORG Administration and General Services  ] in the [ORG Presidential Administration  ] , was , among other jobs , a former head of the [MISC Financial Police  ] and , before that , in the 1990s , in charge of privatization . 
[PER Aslan Musin  ] is the current Chief of Staff for [PER Nazarbayev  ] . 
[PER Kanat Saudabayev  ] , a personal friend of [PER Nazarbayev  ] for nearly 40 years , is Minister of State and Foreign Minister . 
[PER Karim Masimov  ] is Prime Minister , and [PER Timur Kulibayev  ] is currently the favored presidential son-in-law , on the [PER Forbes  ] 500 list of billionaires ( as is his wife separately ) , and the ultimate controller of 90% of the economy of [LOC Kazakhstan  ] . 
END NOTE . 
) In response to a question , [PER Idenov  ] said that [PER Masimov  ] has a degree of freedom , but never acts without permission from " the hyphen " ( [PER Kulibayev  ] ) . 
Then [PER Idenov  ] stood up abruptly and carried his [ORG PDA  ] to a ledge about 20 feet from the table and asked the Ambassador to turn off his cell phone. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER Idenov  ] said he wanted to explain why he has been less visible for at least the last half year . 
Starting last spring , all the " [MISC Big Four  ] " ( on the menu ) began blocking him from seeing President [PER Nazarbayev  ] . 
In October , KMG President [ORG ASTANA  ] 00000072 002 OF 003 [PER Kairgeldy Kabyldin  ] told [PER Idenov  ] , " [PER Kulibayev  ] doesn't want to work with you any more . 
" [PER Idenov  ] said he replied , " Fine , " immediately returned to his office , wrote his letter of resignation , and packed up his personal files and photos of his family . 
" He said Mynbayev immediately called and asked , " My dear friend , what are you doing ? ! 
" [PER Idenov  ] said he was fed up and was going to the [LOC Middle East  ] to work -- " I want out of here ! 
" PM [PER Masimov  ] called and said , " [PER Nazarbayev  ] wants to know how you're doing . 
He 'd really like to see you when you have time . 
" [PER Idenov  ] , who said he 'd been trying to see the President for months but had been blocked by the " [MISC Big Four  ] , " went to see the President and told him , " [PER Kabyldin  ] says [PER Kulibayev  ] doesn't want to work with me any more . 
" [PER Idenov  ] said the President told him to calm down: " It 's probably just evil gossip . 
I'll have [PER Karim  ] ( [PER Masimov  ] ) talk to [PER Timur  ] ( [PER Kulibayev  ] ) . 
Then [PER Idenov  ] went to [PER Masimov  ] and told him , " [LOC OK  ] , I'll stay , but how do I deal with this ? 
" [PER Masimov  ] said he 'd talk to both [PER Kabyldin  ] and [ORG Kulibayev.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) Soon , intermediaries arranged an [MISC Idenov-Kulibayev  ] meeting . 
[PER Idenov  ] said they both pretended to ignore the core problem -- [PER Kulibayev  ] 's , he alleged , avarice for large bribes . 
[PER Idenov  ] averred he told [PER Kulibayev  ] , " Please watch your image and reputation . 
You have a real opportunity to improve your own image and the image of the nation . 
" [PER Idenov  ] said [PER Kulibayev  ] was " like a [LOC Buddha  ] with a [LOC Paris  ] manicure , " and both understood life would continue . 
[PER Idenov  ] said he believes he has , so far , the president 's protection . 
" But the games continue , " he said . 
[PER Idenov  ] alleged that both [ORG BG  ] and [LOC Italy  ] 's [ORG ENI  ] are corrupt -- and [PER Kulibayev  ] is salivating to profit from them -- but , so far , [PER Idenov  ] stands in the way . 
" So long as [PER Nazarbayev  ] says he wants [MISC Kashagan  ] and [MISC Karachaganak  ] developed according to international standards , that 's what I'll do . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) ( NOTE: Fugitive former CEO of [ORG BTA  ] bank , [PER Mukhtar Ablyazov  ] , accused of embezzling over $1 billion , recently leaked " documentary evidence " to the international media that [LOC China  ] 's state companies have bribed [PER Kulibayev  ] over $100 million in recent months for oil deals . 
END NOTE . 
) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) The Ambassador asked if the corruption and infighting are worse now than before . 
[PER Idenov  ] paused , thought , and then replied , " No , not really . 
It 's business as usual . 
" [PER Idenov  ] brushed off a question if the current maneuverings are part of a succession struggle . 
" Of course not . 
It 's too early for that . 
As it 's always been , it 's about big money . 
Capitalism -- you call it market economy -- means huge money . 
Listen , almost everyone at the top is confused . 
They're confused by their [MISC Soviet  ] mentality . 
They're confused by the corrupt excesses of capitalism . 
'If [ORG Goldman Sachs  ] executives can make $50 million a year and then run [LOC America  ] 's economy in [LOC Washington  ] , what 's so different about what we do ? 
' they ask . 
" OTHER TIDBITS <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) MODEST WEALTH . 
[PER Idenov  ] alleged that [ORG MEMR  ] 's Mynbayev is among the richest in [LOC Kazakhstan  ] but " flies under the radar " because he is a relatively modest and very hard-working technocrat . 
His great wealth derives , in part , from his former ownership of [LOC KazKommerzBank  ] -- " But he never flaunts it . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) VULTURES . 
[PER Idenov  ] alleged that [ORG GazProm  ] and [ORG China National Petroleum Company  ] " continue to circle like vultures , " hoping that the [MISC Kashagan  ] and [MISC Karachaganak  ] consortia will implode , and then they can pick up the pieces . 
" Won't happen on my watch ! 
" [PER Idenov  ] vowed. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) HOW TO ORDER LAMB . 
[PER Idenov  ] insisted the Ambassador order a bottle of wine for their dinner but then never touched his first glass . 
Instead , he gulped three cans of [LOC Coca-Cola  ] while inhaling his food . 
When both he and the Ambassador ordered lamb chops , [PER Idenov  ] advised , " Well done , [ORG ASTANA  ] 00000072 003 OF 003 never rare -- this is [ORG Astana  ] , not [LOC London  ] ! 
" <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) COMMENT: [PER Idenov  ] is effusive , even theatrical , by nature . 
When he trusts , he spills his heart . 
Of course , there 's no doubt he also spins his own narrative , as we all do . 
And so , this dinner is simply a snapshot -- but , we would judge , a relatively accurate glimpse of one version of current reality . 
The significant point is that [PER Nazarbayev  ] is standing with [PER Idenov  ] , not [PER Kulibayev  ] , to maintain international standards to develop the massive [MISC Kashagan  ] and [MISC Karachaganak  ] hydrocarbon projects . 
END COMMENT .
