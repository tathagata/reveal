The [ORG DCM  ] chaired the meeting . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG RSO  ] stated the current threat levels for post and stressed that [LOC Caracas  ] is critical and high in 4 of the 6 threat categories . 
[ORG RSO  ] and other sections confirmed that [ORG Venezuelan Intelligence Services  ] ( [ORG Directorate of Military Intelligence-DIM  ] and the [ORG Bolivarian Intelligence Service-SEBIN  ] formerly [ORG DISIP  ] ) are conducting HUMINT and TECH operations against [MISC Embassy  ] staff , as well as political opposition leaders and are controlled by the [ORG Cuban Intelligence Service  ] operating in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
While the collection priority appears to be for political opposition leaders , [ORG RSO  ] reminded everyone that the VIS have the capability , means and desire to monitor and target [MISC Embassy  ] staff . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During a review of the current threat levels [ORG RSO  ] and [ORG SEO  ] stressed the requirement that locally engaged staff without security clearances must be escorted at all times in the [ORG CAA  ] . 
This includes the front entrance of the 5th floor area near the elevators . 
LE Staff must not be left unattended in that area . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG RSO  ] reminded [ORG Section  ] heads when having staff meetings with local employees ( non-cleared [MISC Americans  ] ) inside [ORG CAA  ] locations the [ORG Section Head MUST  ] compartmentalize all information and only discuss unclassified information in their presence . 
In addition [ORG SEO  ] explained the standards for introducing electronic or new items into [ORG CAA  ] locations and reiterated that no computers or other electronic items are allowed in [ORG CAA  ] unless they have been sent securely to Post through the classified pouch system and controlled at all times . 
Personal items must be screened and tagged by the [ORG SEO  ] before entering the [ORG CAA  ] areas . 
This standard applies to all agencies and staff , [ORG PSC  ] or TDY . 
[ORG SEO  ] is working with MGT to send out a management notice to all staff reminding them of proper procurement procedures for [ORG CAA  ] locations . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG RSO  ] reiterated to all [ORG Section  ] heads the Department policy and guidelines for [MISC Foreign Contact Reporting  ] and encouraged all [ORG Section Heads  ] to review the contact reporting policy with all Cleared [MISC Americans  ] in their sections . 
In addition [ORG RSO  ] reminded staff that contact reporting is required for all personal social engagements with locally engaged staff from the [MISC Embassy  ] . 
[ORG RSO  ] will resubmit the [LOC Mission Security Notice  ] on [MISC Foreign Contact Reporting  ] next week as a reminder to all staff . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As part of Post [ORG Debriefing Program  ] , [ORG RSO  ] expects DS TDY support from [LOC Washington  ] in [LOC March/April  ] to assist with the Annual Security Briefings for all [MISC Embassy  ] staff . 
[ORG RSO  ] will hold another debriefing review this month for all cleared-American staff arriving at post over the last 90 to 120 days . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG RSO  ] stressed the need to establish a clear post policy on the issuance of [ORG FOBs  ] and Opennet Blackberries . 
[ORG IMO  ] stated that currently only cleared [MISC American  ] staff have been issued [ORG FOBs  ] and Blackberries , but a few sections have stated the need for a FSN to carry Blackberries . 
It was agreed that the [ORG CIWG  ] will review all requests for [ORG FOBS  ] and Blackberries and will determine if the need and stated justification should be approved or denied . 
The [ORG CIWG  ] discussed the pros and cons of [ORG FOB  ] use within [LOC Venezuela  ] and on home computers . 
The [ORG CIWG  ] affirmed that [ORG FOBs  ] should remain issued only to cleared [MISC American  ] staff ( Further review of the Department guidelines and requirements states that based on Caracas' threat level cleared [MISC American  ] staff must only use the [ORG FOBS  ] on computers that meet all the Department required security guidelines . 
) The [ORG CIWG  ] determined that individuals assigned [ORG FOBs  ] should evaluate their need and use discretion of the [ORG FOB  ] only when the work cannot be completed at the [MISC Embassy  ] ( perhaps only Unclass and not [ORG SBU  ] ) . 
Cleared [MISC Americans  ] issued [ORG FOBs  ] should receive an additional briefing from the [ORG ISSO  ] and the [ORG RSO  ] to discourage frivolous use of the [MISC FOB  ] , with a review of what constitutes [ORG SBU  ] , especially for non-State Agencies . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Point of contact for this cable is [ORG ARSO  ] [PER Andres Barcenas  ] and [ORG RSO Wendy  ] Bashnan , telephone number 58-212-907-8403 .
