REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) Department action request - please see para two . 
SUMMARY - - - - - - - - <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The [ORG Council of Europe’s  ] ( [ORG COE  ] ) [ORG Parliamentary Assembly  ] ( [ORG PACE  ] ) is expected to elect the next Secretary General of the [ORG COE  ] ( [ORG REF  ] A ) September 29 or 30 ; a ranking Department official should consider reviewing our human rights agenda with the new [MISC SecGen  ] soon - please see para two . 
The [MISC Georgians  ] are pushing for a political confrontation with [LOC Russia  ] at the [ORG PACE  ] session September 28-October 2 , with over 70 [ORG PACE  ] members supporting debate over the [MISC Russian  ] delegation’s credentials . 
Several western [MISC European  ] ambassadors have told us they want to prevent a plenary debate which would provoke a walkout by the [MISC Russians  ] . 
Separately , a few ambassadors questioned [ORG Human Rights Commissioner  ] Hammarberg’s authority to write to all member states urging them to consider accepting detainees from [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
We do not expect this to hamper the [MISC Commissioner’s  ] continuing to support us on this issue . 
End summary . 
EARLY CONSULTATIONS WITH NEW SECGEN WOULD BENEFIT [LOC U.S.  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Mateo Sorinas  ] , [ORG PACE  ] Secretary General , briefed us September 21 on the September 28-October 2 [ORG PACE  ] session . 
Despite lingering institutional rivalry between the [ORG PACE  ] and member states , the [ORG PACE  ] is expected finally to elect former [MISC Norwegian  ] PM [PER Jagland  ] September 29 or 30 . 
According to [ORG COE  ] Chief of Protocol [PER Benitez  ] , [PER Jagland  ] would take his oath within a day of being elected and likely would assume his full-time duties in [LOC Strasbourg  ] by mid-October . 
Comment: [PER Jagland  ] can be expected to criticize the [LOC U.S.  ] for the death penalty ; he may , however , be less enthusiastic than the previous [MISC SecGen  ] , [PER Terry Davis  ] ( [LOC UK  ] ) , in publicly criticizing renditions , particularly if we review such issues with him soon . 
In this regard , we highly recommend a visit by a ranking Department official , such as the Assistant Secretary for DRL , to review our human rights agenda with the new Secretary General in the next several weeks . 
COMMISSIONER CRITICIZED FOR LETTER ON [MISC GUANTANAMO DETAINEES  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG Human Rights Commissioner  ] [PER Thomas Hammarberg  ] , in his quarterly report to the Council of [MISC Ministers’  ] deputies ( resident ambassadors ) September 23 , briefly mentioned his “informal” visit a few months ago to [LOC Washington  ] , during which he told [ORG Administration  ] officials that the [LOC U.S.  ] could not expect [MISC European  ] countries to accept detainees from [LOC Guantanamo  ] if the [LOC U.S.  ] were not willing to accept some on [LOC U.S.  ] soil . 
[PER Hammarberg  ] was then criticized by a few ambassadors for having written in June to all [ORG COE  ] member states calling on them to consider accepting detainees from [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
The [MISC Maltese  ] Ambassador ( one of those criticizing [PER Hammarberg  ] ) told us privately that [PER Hammarberg  ] thinks he is “God’s gift to the world.” The ambassador added that , if [LOC Washington  ] wanted assistance with the detainees , it had plenty of direct channels to [MISC European  ] countries and did not need [PER Hammarberg  ] to carry its messages . 
Comment: A few ambassadors , including the [MISC Maltese  ] , have a history of bad relations with [PER Hammarberg  ] . 
Most member states respect and even relish Hammarberg’s independence . 
We do not expect this recent criticism to stifle [PER Hammarberg  ] from raising the detainee issue with [MISC European  ] officials . 
GEORGIA: TIME TO QUESTION RUSSIA’S CREDENTIALS IN THE PACE - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [MISC Georgian  ] Ambassador told us September 23 that he is confident the upcoming [ORG PACE  ] session will result in some sort of sanctions against the [MISC Russian  ] [ORG PACE  ] delegation . 
He said it is high time for the [ORG COE  ] to penalize [LOC Russia  ] for its non-compliance with its [ORG COE  ] commitments , including but not limited to its actions on [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia  ] . 
Over 70 [ORG PACE  ] members , mainly from conservative parties from central and eastern [LOC Europe  ] , have signed a petition to debate the [MISC Russian  ] delegation’s credentials . 
No [MISC Georgian  ] [ORG PACE  ] member has signed in an effort to demonstrate that this is a “COE issue , not simply a [MISC Georgian  ] one.” The [MISC Russians  ] have made it well known that their [ORG PACE  ] delegation will walk out if the issue is debated in plenary ( note: it will first be debated in the [ORG Monitoring Committee  ] ) . 
While the [MISC Romanian  ] Ambassador told us that the [ORG COE  ] will demonstrate it means business on this issue , the [MISC Danish  ] Ambassador told us that most member states , “taking a cue from the [ORG EU  ] , [ORG NATO  ] , and various [MISC European  ] and non-European countries , ” want better relations with [LOC Russia  ] and therefore seek to head off a confrontation . 
He also noted that the leaders of the political groups and committees in [ORG PACE  ] do not support questioning Russia’s credentials . 
The [MISC Russian  ] Ambassador , speaking at the deputies’ session September 23 , stressed that any move to question the [MISC Russian  ] delegation’s credentials would “impose real damage to the image of the [ORG PACE  ] and the [ORG COE  ] . 
Comment: While the [MISC Georgians  ] will view the [ORG Monitoring Committee’s  ] debate on the credentials as a victory , it likely [ORG STRASBOURG  ] 00000021 002.2 OF 002 will be a hollow one - we doubt that the [ORG PACE  ] plenary will , in the face of a [MISC Russian  ] walkout , vote to support any serious sanctions against the Russians.nor OTHER ISSUES - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Hammarberg  ] and the [MISC Serbian  ] Ambassador had a testy exchange September 23 on [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
The [MISC Serb  ] made the usual points about its “southern province , ” claiming there has been no progress on IDPs and that there is a lack of freedom of movement for non-ethnic [MISC Albanians  ] . 
She also criticized references to the [PER Ahtisaari Plan  ] and the [LOC Kosovo  ] Constitution in Hammarberg’s report . 
[PER Hammarberg  ] retorted that his report covered the [MISC Serb  ] minority’s concerns . 
He then underscored that he is “obliged to cover the concerns of [MISC Europeans  ] - to help individuals - even if this might be viewed as supporting one side or another politically.” He called on the [MISC Serbian  ] Ambassador not to undermine his work “when we are trying to assist people.” <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Several delegations and officials from the [ORG European Court of Human Rights  ] have told us that recent rhetoric from [LOC Moscow  ] , including from the [LOC Duma  ] , on support for court reforms is just that - rhetoric . 
Few hold out any hope that [LOC Russia  ] will ratify Protocol 14 ( REF B ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In a rather sad exchange at the deputies’ meeting September 23 , the [MISC Greek  ] Ambassador criticized photos apparently chosen for Commissioner Hammarberg’s website regarding Hammarberg’s recent official visit to [LOC Turkey  ] . 
The [MISC Greek  ] ( echoed by the [MISC Italian  ] and [MISC Maltese  ] ambassadors ) contrasted the “vacation-like , very positive” images with those associated with the [ORG Commissioner’s  ] visit to [LOC Greece  ] . 
[PER Hammarberg  ] challenged the [MISC Greek  ] by noting that his report on [LOC Turkey  ] had not yet been published , and therefore the photos for the website had not yet been selected .
