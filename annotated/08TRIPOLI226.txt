REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) In a meeting on March 16 , [ORG MFA  ] U/S-equivalent for [MISC European  ] Affairs [PER Abdulati Obeidi  ] passed [ORG CDA  ] and P/E Chief a copy of a note proposing a meeting with [ORG USG  ] officials " at the earliest possible date " to begin discussions regarding a comprehensive settlement of all legal claims pending in [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Libyan  ] courts . 
( [ORG Note: Post  ] 's translation is at para 4 ; original [MISC Arabic  ] language text has been scanned and sent to [ORG NEA/MAG  ] via email . 
End note . 
) Noting that the [MISC Libyan  ] proposal stemmed from discussions in February in [LOC Europe  ] between [ORG NEA A/S David Welch  ] , [ORG Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi and [PER Obeidi  ] , he said the [ORG GOL  ] also transmitted the note and instructions to [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG CDA  ] in [LOC Washington  ] , [PER Ali Aujali  ] , on March 15 . 
It was expected that [PER Aujali  ] would convey the note to the Department on March 17 . 
The offer by the [ORG GOL  ] to negotiate a comprehensive settlement represented an important " political decision " by the [ORG GOL  ] , he said . 
2 . 
( C ) [PER Obeidi  ] suggested that initial discussions could focus on the three major outstanding claims cases in [LOC U.S.  ] venues: [ORG Pan Am  ] 103 , [PER LaBelle  ] , and [ORG UTA  ] . 
Emphasizing his desire to avoid " surprises " , he said that the [ORG GOL  ] team would also raise judgments in [MISC Libyan  ] courts related to the 1986 [MISC Operation El Dorado Canyon  ] bombing of [LOC Tripoli  ] and [LOC Benghazi  ] . 
[PER Obeidi  ] said the [MISC Libyan  ] team would consist of himself , Deputy Foreign Minister-equivalent Dr. [PER Muhammad Siala  ] , attorney and head of the [ORG GOL  ] 's litigation committee [PER Ahmed Mselati  ] , attorney [PER Azzam al-Dib  ] , attorney Dr. [PER Ali Dawi  ] , attorney [PER Azza al-Maghour  ] , and [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] official [PER Munther Ramadan  ] . 
( [ORG Note: DFM Siala  ] 's position was formally abolished , together with all deputy minister-equivalent positions , in the wake of Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] 's March 2 speech to the General People 's [ORG Congress  ] ; however , [PER Siala  ] remains in his office at the [ORG MFA  ] . 
[PER Obeidi  ] said a " reorganization " would occur , but suggested [PER Siala  ] may remain at the [ORG MFA  ] in some as-yet undetermined capacity . 
End note . 
) [PER Obeidi  ] said discussions to date on a comprehensive settlement had been at the political level ; [PER Obeidi  ] suggested the time was now right for the two sides to include legal experts who could help formulate modalities of a possible settlement mechanism . 
3 . 
( C ) Noting his understanding that positive movement on claims - particularly high-profile cases - could lend impetus to efforts to find a mechanism to mitigate the effects of section 1083 of the 2008 [ORG National Defense Authorization Act  ] ( the " [MISC Lautenberg Amendment  ] " ) , [PER Obeidi  ] stressed that the [ORG GOL  ] would like to meet with the [LOC U.S.  ] team as quickly as possible . 
The [ORG GOL  ] 's preference is that the venue be either in [LOC Tripoli  ] or in [LOC Europe  ] ( [LOC London  ] , [LOC Rome  ] and [LOC Geneva  ] were suggested ) . 
Citing what he said was the decision of the [LOC U.S.  ] judge in the [ORG Pan Am  ] 103 case to suspend legal proceedings in the case while negotiations were underway , [PER Obeidi  ] said the [ORG GOL  ] hoped proceedings could be similarly suspended in the [PER LaBelle  ] and [ORG UTA  ] cases . 
4 . 
( C ) [PER Begin  ] informal translation of note: A Proposal to the [ORG U.S. State Department Regarding Settlement of Pending Issues Between  ] the Two [MISC Countries Recalling  ] the cases filed against the [ORG Great Jamahiriya  ] and a number of its nationals in [LOC U.S.  ] courts and Amendment 1083 of the 2008 [ORG U.S. Defense Authorization  ] bill , and recalling verdicts pronounced by [MISC Libyan  ] courts for compensation of victims of the [MISC American  ] raid on [LOC Libya  ] in the year 1986 of the [MISC Christian  ] calendar ; and recalling the intensive contacts between the two sides at the political and legal levels regarding the desire to reach a comprehensive settlement of all pending issues . 
We wish to inform you of our agreement to reach a settlement that would include all pending isues and would put a definitive end to all judicial disputes and permit forward movement in the development of bilateral relations in all areas of cooperation serving the interests of the two countries: We therefore propose the following: - Within the framework of implementing the above-referenced settlement , a fund shall be established for the purpose of compensating victims of both countries , to be funded directly or indirectly in accordance with a mutually agreed mechanism that is to be specified in detail within the framework of the proposed settlement. - To suspend legal proceedings of cases currently before [LOC U.S.  ] courts , to suspend implementation of verdicts issued in both countries and to commence negotiations regarding a comprehensive settlement. - To hold an official meeting between representatives of both countries at the earliest possible date to discuss a comprehensive settlement agreement . 
We propose that the venue for such a meeting be either [LOC Tripoli  ] or any [MISC European  ] country . 
Awaiting your reply , we offer assurances of our respect and highest consideration . 
Date: March 11 , 2008 .
