( [ORG SBU  ] ) Outgoing [ORG TNK-BP  ] COO [PER Tim Summers  ] told the Ambassador on September 11 that his company’s production would rise about 3% in 2009 , that the company’s finances are in good shape , and that relations with the [MISC Russian  ] shareholders are “rational and professional.” [PER Summers  ] noted , however , that the sector overall still operates very inefficiently and government policies hindering modernization are not likely to change anytime soon . 
End summary. ------------------------ [ORG TNK-BP  ] HAS BRIGHT FUTURE ------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Outgoing [ORG TNK-BP  ] COO [PER Tim Summers  ] and his successor , [PER Bill Schrader  ] ( previously head of BP’s [LOC Azerbaijan  ] operations ) , told the Ambassador in a September 11 meeting that 2009 would be a good year for the company and that the future also looked bright . 
[PER Summers  ] said [ORG TNK-BP  ] expects 3 percent production growth in 2009 . 
He said the firm paid out approximately $1.5 billion in dividends in the first half of 2009 , and will likely pay out another $1 billion in the second half. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to [PER Summers  ] , [MISC TNK-BP’s  ] financial performance has helped to smooth relations between [ORG BP  ] and the [MISC Russian  ] shareholders ( [ORG AAR  ] ) -- “They don’t want to kill the only goose in their portfolio that is laying golden eggs.” He said relations between shareholders and management is “more rational and professional” than he has seen in the past , and he foresees no strategic disagreements on the horizon . 
Given a strong cash position and low debt , [ORG TNK-BP  ] has raised its capital budget several times over the past year , without controversy from the board . 
He noted that the board was completely aligned on the attempt to take over [ORG Sibir Energy  ] , for which [MISC TNK-BP’s  ] $2.5 billion offer fell short of [MISC Gazprom’s  ] bid of $3 billion . 
[PER Summers  ] added that he does not believe [ORG AAR  ] partners will give up equity in the company anytime soon , as had previously been expected. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Summers  ] said he was concerned , however , that at some point BP’s role in [ORG TNK-BP  ] will be questioned by the political leadership because [ORG BP  ] has “put in $8 billion” into the company and has “already taken out $12 billion.” He explained that since [ORG BP  ] reinvests its dividends largely in projects outside of [LOC Russia  ] , he expects the company to receive more political scrutiny. ---------- OPERATIONS ---------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Summers  ] told us [ORG TNK-BP  ] will spend about $7 billion in the coming years moving from exploration to production in major fields in the [LOC Yamal  ] region . 
According to [PER Summers  ] , the company’s Ruskoe field should yield “at least” 1 billion barrels of oil , even if [ORG TNK-BP  ] exploits it very inefficiently . 
He said the [LOC Yamal  ] fields should tie into Rosneft’s pipeline infrastructure for its Vankor field , but that given the difficulties of negotiating these arrangements in [LOC Russia  ] , it is entirely possible that [ORG TNK-BP  ] would have “to waste $2 billion” building its own pipeline to move oil out . 
[ORG TNK-BP  ] is also planning to invest $1.5 billion over the next five years in refining , an area in which [PER Schrader  ] has spent much of his career . 
In all , [PER Summers  ] said , [ORG TNK-BP  ] is likely to invest up to $3-4 billion per year over the next ten years . 
Expat experts who had left the company during the dispute between the shareholders are returning , but [PER Summers  ] believed the company could use another 50 such employees. --------------------- INEFFICIENCIES ABOUND --------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Summers  ] was less sanguine about the oil and gas [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00002353 002 OF 003 sector as a whole . 
He indicated that built-in inefficiencies and government influence hamper the rational development of the , many parts of which are facing tough times . 
[PER Summers  ] said he believes both [ORG Gazprom  ] and [ORG Lukoil  ] have put many employees on unpaid leave . 
He said [ORG Gazprom  ] will continue to face pressure from increased and cheaper global LNG supplies -- “If you’re a [MISC European  ] buyer , the last molecule of gas you will want is from Gazprom.” He noted that due to the recession , subcontractors were having difficulty maintaining quality and delivering services on time. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The inefficiencies in the system “are so huge , ” according to [PER Summers  ] , that it would take a very long time to modernize the [MISC Russian  ] oil and gas sector . 
For example , [PER Summers  ] pointed out that a well that would take 10 days to drill in [LOC Canada  ] would take 20 days to drill in [LOC Russia  ] . 
He said moving a drilling rig from one site to another , a process that might take 7 or 8 hours in [LOC Canada  ] , takes 28 DAYS in [LOC Russia  ] -- “multiply that by hundreds or thousands and you can start to imagine the costs to the economy.” <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) One way to get around the operational inefficiencies would be to have [MISC American  ] oil-field service companies license and manufacture their products in [LOC Russia  ] . 
According to [PER Summers  ] , that would make life politically easier for companies like [ORG TNK-BP  ] and it would improve the efficiency of [MISC Russian  ] industry . 
However , he lamented , [LOC Russia  ] continues to be seen as too risky by many service companies , which have concerns about intellectual property protection of licensed products and are scared off by the negative headlines about [LOC Russia  ] . 
He explained that many of these companies are not large enough to absorb the potential losses from a major investment gone bad . 
Furthermore , he added there were simply better opportunities for these companies elsewhere over the past few years during the oil price boom. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In discussing the various difficulties facing the sector , [PER Summers  ] complained about the perennial problem of a lack of adequate access to [MISC Gazprom’s  ] pipelines . 
He said that while [ORG Gazprom  ] plans to invest tens of billions in new production , [ORG TNK-BP  ] and other oil companies have large amounts of gas available that they cannot sell . 
The gas cannot even be booked as a part of these companies’ reserves until it has access to a market , he said . 
[PER Summers  ] suggested that such an inefficient situation is simply not sustainable and that common sense should ultimately prevail to force change. -------------------------- CRISIS HAS NOT SOBERED GOR -------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) That transition , however , doesn’t seem imminent . 
Responding to the Ambassador’s inquiry about the [MISC GOR’s  ] posture toward foreign investment in the wake of the economic crisis , [PER Summers  ] said he has seen “no evidence” of a change . 
He said oil company Slavneft ( on whose board [PER Summers  ] sits ) , had been ordered to cancel an order for foreign equipment in favor of a domestic supplier , even though the foreign equipment was clearly superior . 
He said that Deputy Prime Minister [PER Igor Sechin  ] ( who is in charge of the energy sector ) told [PER Summers  ] directly that he should be using [MISC Russian  ] gas turbines instead of the preferable [ORG GE  ] models [ORG TNK-BP  ] was buying . 
[PER Summers  ] also expressed some concern about [MISC TNK-BP’s  ] involuntary involvement in a [MISC Russian  ] oil company consortium in [LOC Venezuela  ] , but deemed it would “not be terminal.” <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Summers  ] said he believed “the moment had passed” for reform . 
He explained that the financial and economic pressures favoring reform lasted for too short a period -- “it would have been better from a long-term perspective to have had several quarters of losses in row.” Given economic stabilization and a rebound in oil prices , reform will now wait. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Summers  ] appears to be leaving behind a company in good shape , but in an industry that badly needs the [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00002353 003 OF 003 modernizing influence of western companies and executives . 
Unfortunately , as [PER Summers  ] pointed out , the GOR , despite welcome words by some of its leaders , has not taken actions to attract more of this influence .
