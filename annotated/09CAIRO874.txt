( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Introduction: President [PER Mubarak  ] last visited [LOC Washington  ] in April 2004 , breaking a twenty year tradition of annual visits to the [LOC White House  ] . 
[MISC Egyptians  ] view President [PER Mubarak  ] 's upcoming meeting with the President as a new beginning to the [MISC U.S.-Egyptian  ] relationship that will restore a sense of mutual respect that they believe diminished in recent years . 
President [PER Mubarak  ] has been encouraged by his initial interactions with the President , the Secretary , and Special [PER Envoy Mitchell  ] , and understands that the Administration wants to restore the sense of warmth that has traditionally characterized the [MISC U.S.-Egyptian  ] partnership . 
The [MISC Egyptians  ] want the visit to demonstrate that [LOC Egypt  ] remains [LOC America  ] 's " indispensible [MISC Arab  ] ally , " and that bilateral tensions have abated . 
President [PER Mubarak  ] is the proud leader of a proud nation . 
He draws heavily from his own long experience in regional politics and governance as he assesses new proposals and recommendations for change . 
MUBARAK'S PROFILE ----------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Mubarak  ] is 81 years old and in reasonably good health ; his most notable problem is a hearing deficit in his left ear . 
He responds well to respect for [LOC Egypt  ] and for his position , but is not swayed by personal flattery . 
[PER Mubarak  ] peppers his observations with anecdotes that demonstrate both his long experience and his sense of humor . 
The recent death of his grandson [PER Mohammad  ] has affected him deeply and undoubtedly will dampen his spirits for the visit which he very much wants to make . 
During his 28 year tenure , he survived at least three assassination attempts , maintained peace with [LOC Israel  ] , weathered two wars in [LOC Iraq  ] and post-2003 regional instability , intermittent economic downturns , and a manageable but chronic internal terrorist threat . 
He is a tried and true realist , innately cautious and conservative , and has little time for idealistic goals . 
[PER Mubarak  ] viewed President [PER Bush  ] ( 43 ) as naive , controlled by subordinates , and totally unprepared for dealing with post-Saddam [LOC Iraq  ] , especially the rise of [LOC Iran  ] , s regional influence. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) On several occasions [PER Mubarak  ] has lamented the [LOC U.S.  ] invasion of [LOC Iraq  ] and the downfall of [PER Saddam  ] . 
He routinely notes that [LOC Egypt  ] did not like [PER Saddam  ] and does not mourn him , but at least he held the country together and countered [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Mubarak  ] continues to state that in his view [LOC Iraq  ] needs a " tough , strong military officer who is fair " as leader . 
This telling observation , we believe , describes [PER Mubarak  ] 's own view of himself as someone who is tough but fair , who ensures the basic needs of his people. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) No issue demonstrates [PER Mubarak  ] , s worldview more than his reaction to demands that he open [LOC Egypt  ] to genuine political competition and loosen the pervasive control of the security services . 
Certainly the public " name and shame " approach in recent years strengthened his determination not to accommodate our views . 
However , even though he will be more willing to consider ideas and steps he might take pursuant to a less public dialogue , his basic understanding of his country and the region predisposes him toward extreme caution . 
We have heard him lament the results of earlier [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to encourage reform in the [MISC Islamic  ] world . 
He can harken back to the [MISC Shah of Iran:  ] the [LOC U.S.  ] encouraged him to accept reforms , only to watch the country fall into the hands of revolutionary religious extremists . 
Wherever he has seen these [LOC U.S.  ] efforts , he can point to the chaos and loss of stability that ensued . 
In addition to [LOC Iraq  ] , he also reminds us that he warned against [MISC Palestinian  ] elections in 2006 that brought [ORG Hamas  ] ( [LOC Iran  ] ) to his doorstep . 
Now , we understand he fears that [LOC Pakistan  ] is on the brink of falling into the hands of the [ORG Taliban  ] , and he puts some of the blame on [LOC U.S.  ] insistence on steps that ultimately weakened [PER Musharraf  ] . 
While he knows that [PER Bashir  ] in [LOC Sudan  ] has made multiple major mistakes , he cannot work to support his removal from power. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Mubarak  ] has no single confidante or advisor who can truly speak for him , and he has prevented any of his main advisors from operating outside their strictly circumscribed spheres of power . 
Defense Minister [PER Tantawi  ] keeps the Armed Forces appearing reasonably sharp and the officers satisfied with their perks and privileges , and [PER Mubarak  ] does not appear concerned that these forces are not well prepared to face 21st century external threats . 
EGIS Chief [PER Omar Soliman  ] and Interior Minister al-Adly keep the domestic beasts at bay , and [PER Mubarak  ] is not one to lose sleep over their tactics . 
[PER Gamal Mubarak  ] and a handful of economic ministers have input on economic and trade matters , but [PER Mubarak  ] will likely resist further economic reform if he views it as potentially harmful to public order and stability . 
Dr. [PER Zakaria Azmi  ] and a few other senior [ORG NDP  ] leaders manage the parliament and public politics. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Mubarak  ] is a classic [MISC Egyptian  ] secularist who hates religious extremism and interference in politics . 
The [ORG Muslim Brothers  ] represent the worst , as they challenge not only [PER Mubarak  ] , s power , but his view of [MISC Egyptian  ] interests . 
As with regional issues , [PER Mubarak  ] , seeks to avoid conflict and spare his people from the violence he predicts would emerge from unleashed personal and civil liberties . 
In [PER Mubarak  ] , s mind , it is far better to let a few individuals suffer than risk chaos for society as a whole . 
He has been supportive of improvements in human rights in areas that do not affect public security or stability . 
Mrs. [PER Mubarak  ] has been given a great deal of room to maneuver to advance women 's and children 's rights and to confront some traditional practices that have been championed by the [MISC Islamists  ] , such as FGM , child labor , and restrictive personal status laws . 
SUCCESSION ---------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The next presidential elections are scheduled for 2011 , and if [PER Mubarak  ] is still alive it is likely he will run again , and , inevitably , win . 
When asked about succession , he states that the process will follow the [MISC Egyptian  ] constitution . 
Despite incessant whispered discussions , no one in [LOC Egypt  ] has any certainty about who will eventually succeed [PER Mubarak  ] nor under what circumstances . 
The most likely contender is presidential son [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] ( whose profile is ever-increasing at the ruling party ) ; some suggest that intelligence chief [PER Omar Soliman  ] might seek the office , or dark horse [ORG Arab League Secretary-General Amre Moussa  ] might run . 
[PER Mubarak  ] 's ideal of a strong but fair leader would seem to discount [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] to some degree , given [PER Gamal  ] 's lack of military experience , and may explain [PER Mubarak  ] 's hands off approach to the succession question . 
Indeed , he seems to be trusting to [PER God  ] and the ubiquitous military and civilian security services to ensure an orderly transition . 
[ORG MUBARAK'S EGYPT:  ] 1982 -- 2009 ----------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [LOC Egypt  ] continues to be a major regional economic , political , and cultural power . 
However , economic problems have frustrated many [MISC Egyptians  ] . 
[LOC Egypt  ] 's per capita GDP was on par with [LOC South Korea  ] 's 30 years ago ; today it is comparable to [LOC Indonesia  ] 's . 
There were bread riots in 2008 for the first time since 1977 . 
Political reforms have stalled and the [ORG GOE  ] has resorted to heavy-handed tactics against individuals and groups , especially the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] , whose influence continues to grow. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Economic reform momentum has slowed and high GDP growth rates of recent years have failed to lift [LOC Egypt  ] 's lower classes out of poverty . 
High inflation , coupled with the impact of the global recession , has resulted in an increase in extreme poverty , job losses , a growing budget deficit and projected 2009 GDP growth of 3.5% - half last year 's rate. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Mubarak  ] himself refuses to discuss economic assistance to [LOC Egypt  ] , but other interlocutors may raise it . 
On May 7 , [LOC Egypt  ] formally and publicly accepted [ORG FY  ] 2009 and [ORG FY  ] 2010 assistance levels , ending a stalemate over the [ORG FY  ] 2009 program , linked to levels , a perceived lack of consultation , and political conditionality . 
Based on our assessment of [LOC Egypt  ] 's most pressing assistance needs , and broad public consensus in [LOC Egypt  ] that the educational system is seriously deficient , we would like to focus on education . 
We believe the [MISC Egyptians  ] would welcome a new presidential level initiative in this area , which would also be in [LOC U.S.  ] national interests given the critical role education will play in [LOC Egypt  ] 's political and economic development . 
[ORG MUBARAK'S REGIONAL OUTLOOK  ] -------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [MISC Israeli-Arab  ] conflict: [PER Mubarak  ] has successfully shepherded [PER Sadat  ] , s peace with [LOC Israel  ] into the 21st century , and benefitted greatly from the stability Camp [PER David  ] has given the [ORG Levant:  ] there has not been a major land war in more than 35 years . 
Peace with [LOC Israel  ] has cemented [LOC Egypt  ] , s moderate role in [LOC Middle East  ] peace efforts and provided a political basis for continued [LOC U.S.  ] military and economic assistance ( $1.3 billion and $250 million , respectively ) . 
However , broader elements of peace with [LOC Israel  ] , e.g. economic and cultural exchange , remain essentially undeveloped. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Camp [PER David  ] also presented [PER Mubarak  ] with the perpetual challenge of balancing [LOC Egypt  ] , s international image as a moderate with its domestic image as pan-Arab leader . 
[PER Mubarak  ] has managed this strategic dichotomy most effectively in times of regional stability . 
However , the [LOC Gulf  ] wars , and especially post-Saddam regional crises , have taxed this equation . 
For example , during the 2006 [LOC Lebanon  ] war , the [ORG Bush Administration  ] asked [LOC Egypt  ] to side against [ORG Hizballah  ] ; at the same time [MISC Egyptian  ] protestors demanded the peace treaty with [LOC Israel  ] be vacated . 
The [MISC Egyptians  ] were frozen , and relegated to waiting for the situation to stabilize . 
More recently , with [LOC Iran  ] bringing the battlefield closer with [ORG Hamas'  ] actions in [LOC Gaza  ] and discovery of the [ORG Hizballah  ] cell in [LOC Egypt  ] , the [MISC Egyptians  ] appear more willing to confront the [MISC Iranian  ] surrogates and to work closely with [LOC Israel.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Mubarak  ] has been effective as an intermediary during various phases of the [MISC Israeli-Arab  ] conflict . 
In the [PER Arafat  ] era , [LOC Egypt  ] worked between the [ORG Palestinian Authority and Israel  ] . 
At the outset of the [LOC Abbas  ] era , [LOC Egypt  ] , s role was unclear as the [MISC Israelis  ] and [MISC Palestinians  ] communicated directly , and [PER Mubarak  ] for a time was left with no deliverable either to the [LOC West  ] or his public . 
He firmly believes , incorrectly , that the [ORG Bush Administration  ] " forced " the [MISC Palestinian  ] legislative elections of 2006 ( which [ORG Hamas  ] won ) . 
[ORG Hamas'  ] June 2007 takeover of [LOC Gaza  ] allowed the [MISC Egyptians  ] back into the game as a go-between , and [PER Mubarak  ] , s team has made clear they will not cede the " [MISC Palestinian  ] file " to another [MISC Arab  ] state . 
In general , the [MISC Egyptian-Israeli  ] strategic relationship is on solid ground , as they face a shared threat from [ORG Hamas.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The ongoing intra-Arab dispute , which pits [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] against [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Qatar  ] and is primarily driven by [LOC Iran  ] 's regional influence , is the current test for [PER Mubarak  ] . 
For the moment the [MISC Egyptian-Saudi  ] moderate camp is holding . 
[PER Mubarak  ] has maneuvered with reasonable effectiveness , brandishing [MISC Egyptian  ] clout through a hastily prepared but effective summit in [LOC Sharm el Sheikh  ] in February , but [LOC Iran  ] , s [MISC Arab  ] surrogates ( especially [LOC Qatar  ] ) continue to unsettle the [MISC Egyptians  ] . 
[PER Mubarak  ] will rail against President [ORG Bush  ] , s decision to invade [LOC Iraq  ] , contending that it opened the door to [MISC Iranian  ] influence in the region . 
That said , the [MISC Egyptians  ] recently told Special [PER Envoy Ross  ] they expect our outreach to [LOC Iran  ] to fail , and that " we should prepare for confrontation through isolation . 
" [PER Mubarak  ] and his advisors are now convinced that [LOC Tehran  ] is working to weaken [LOC Egypt  ] through creation of [ORG Hizballah  ] cells , support of the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] , and destabilization of [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[LOC Egypt  ] has warned that it will retaliate if these actions continue. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC Egypt  ] views the stability and unity of [LOC Sudan  ] as essential to its national security because of concern over its access to [ORG Nile  ] waters and the potential for increased [MISC Sudanese  ] refugee flows . 
The [ORG GOE  ] is using development assistance in [LOC South Sudan  ] to encourage unity . 
Here too , the [MISC Egyptians  ] are jealous and sensitive to the [MISC Qatari  ] foray into resolving [LOC Darfur  ] , a crisis squarely in [LOC Egypt  ] 's backyard . 
[PER Mubarak  ] may ask about the potential for cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] on [LOC Sudan  ] and will probably want to hear how the [ORG Administration  ] will approach the issue . 
If he agrees , [PER Mubarak  ] can use his stature and credibility with Bashir to make progress on [LOC Darfur  ] and human rights issues. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER MUBARAK  ] REGIONAL TALKING POINTS ----------------------------------------- [MISC Israeli-Arab  ] peace: He will ask for continued [LOC U.S.  ] leadership and highlight Egypt’s role as moderate interlocutor . 
He will stress the primacy of the [MISC Palestinian  ] track over efforts with [LOC Syria  ] . 
He will press for concrete action on settlements and resist [MISC Arab  ] gestures to [LOC Israel  ] until the [MISC Arabs  ] can see whether or not [PER Netanyahu  ] is credible . 
Iran: He will rail against [MISC Iranian  ] regional influence and express pessimism about [LOC U.S.  ] outreach to [LOC Tehran  ] . 
He will make clear that there should be no linkage between [MISC Israeli-Arab  ] peace and [LOC Iran  ] but will agree with the President’s assessment that such linkage as does exist argues for progress on the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] track to undermine [ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
Sudan: He will highlight Egypt’s role as provider of humanitarian and military assistance , and stress the need to maintain stability . 
Intra-Arab strife: He may criticize [LOC Qatar  ] , and perhaps [LOC Syria  ] , as [MISC Iranian  ] surrogates . 
He may ask about our plan to engage [LOC Damascus  ] and suggest we coordinate our efforts . 
Iraq: He may be circumspect , but harbors continuing doubts about [PER Maliki  ] and his [MISC Iranian  ] ties . 
He will say [LOC Egypt  ] is open to bilateral improvement but is awaiting [MISC Iraqi  ] actions .
