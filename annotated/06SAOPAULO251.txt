SUMMARY: In late March , [LOC Brazil  ] plans to send its first astronaut into space aboard a [MISC Russian  ] rocket . 
This event appears to be the first step in space-related cooperation between [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Russia  ] . 
Despite the historic significance of this flight for [LOC Brazil  ] , the director of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG National Space Agency  ] has derided the event as a mere " publicity stunt . 
" END SUMMARY. ------------------------ HITCHING A RIDE TO SPACE ------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
On March 29 , [ORG Air Force Lt. Col. Marcos  ] [PER Cesar Pontes  ] will become [LOC Brazil  ] 's first person in space when he flies on a [MISC Russian  ] Soyuz rocket to the [ORG International Space Station  ] . 
[PER Pontes  ] will blast off from the [LOC Baikonur Cosmodrome  ] in [LOC Kazakhstan  ] with [MISC Russian  ] astronaut [PER Pavel Vinogradov  ] and [MISC American  ] astronaut [PER Jeffrey Williams  ] and spend eight days on the [ORG International Space Station  ] before returning to Earth with the outgoing two-man crew. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
[PER Pontes  ] began training in 1998 in the [LOC U.S.  ] After the [ORG GOB  ] reevaluated their participation in the international space station , [LOC Pontes'  ] participation with the [LOC U.S.  ] crew was put on an indefinite hold . 
Press reports indicate that in 2005 , the [ORG GOB  ] began discussions with [LOC Russia  ] about the possibility of [PER Pontes  ] traveling aboard a [MISC Russian  ] rocket . 
During a November 2004 visit to [LOC Brazil  ] , [MISC Russian  ] President [PER Vladimir Putin  ] pledged [MISC Russian  ] support to help [LOC Brazil  ] resume its space program and restore its rocket-launching base , which was destroyed by a rocket explosion in 2003 that killed 21 people . 
[LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Russia  ] signed an agreement for [PER Ponte  ] 's space mission during [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  ] 's visit to [LOC Moscow  ] in October 2005. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
During the mission , [PER Pontes  ] will conduct nine scientific experiments in the sphere of nano-technology , bio-technology , and plant behavior in micro-gravitational conditions . 
A former test pilot , [PER Pontes  ] , who is currently making final preparations for the flight at the [LOC Star City  ] astronaut training center outside [LOC Moscow  ] , told reporters , " I started as a technician on the railroad . 
My first dream was to join the air force and fly fighter planes . 
It wasn't until I was an [ORG Air Force  ] pilot that I began to dream about space . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
The last person to buy a ticket on a Soyuz rocket was [MISC American  ] entrepreneur and scientist [PER Gregory Olsen  ] , who returned safely to earth October 2005 . 
[PER Olsen  ] paid an estimated [MISC USD  ] 20 million for the trip. --------------------------------------- THE BEGINNING OF A BEAUTIFUL FREINDSHIP --------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
The low price [LOC Brazil  ] paid to [LOC Russia  ] ( supposedly [MISC USD  ] 10.5 million , versus [PER Olsen  ] 's [MISC USD  ] 20 million ) was not just a friendly gesture . 
According to [MISC Brazilian  ] news reports , the [MISC Russian  ] government considers [LOC Pontes'  ] flight the first stage of cooperation between the two nations in the space sector and expects to win the bid for the construction of a [MISC Brazilian  ] satellite . 
The cooperation includes negotiations to use the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Alcantara  ] facility ( located in the northeastern state of [LOC Maranhao  ] close to the equator ) to launch [MISC Russian  ] commercial satellites . 
According to [LOC Moscow  ] , the [ORG Alcantara  ] base needs about [MISC USD  ] 300 million worth of upgrades in order to become a launch center . 
While not committing to the full amount needed to refurbish the site , the [MISC Russians  ] are considering providing financial assistance for the upgrades. --------------------------------------------- ----- [MISC BRAZILIAN  ] SPACE FLIGHT IS A MERE " PUBLICITY STUNT " --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
COMMENT: The new director of the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Aerospace Technology Center  ] , [ORG Air Force Lt. Brigadier  ] Carlos [PER Augusto Leal Velloso  ] , said in a recent interview with daily [ORG Folha de Sao Paulo  ] that the [PER Pontes  ] 's upcoming space flight is a mere " publicity stunt " that " will bring no scientific benefit to [LOC Brazil  ] . 
" In an election year that has seen President [PER Lula  ] up and down in the polls , it isn't hard to imagine who the " publicity stunt " is meant to benefit . 
This may be the final word in a mission that may ultimately be described as [ORG SAO PAULO  ] 00000251 002 OF 002 merely " one small step " for [LOC Brazil  ] .
