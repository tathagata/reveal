<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L BANGKOK 005811 SIPDIS SIPDIS TREASURY PASS TO FRB SAN FRANCISCO/TERESA CURRAN EO 12958 DECL: 09/19/2016 TAGS PGOV , PHUM , TH SUBJECT: THAILAND: MY MEETING WITH GENERAL SONTHI Classified By: Ambassador [PER Ralph L. Boyce  ] , reason 1.4 ( b ) ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) I met with General [PER Sonthi  ] privately directly after he addressed the diplomatic corps this afternoon . 
He thought the session had gone well ( see septel for details ; I doubt most of the [MISC Western  ] diplomats , at least , will share his assessment ) . <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) I began by asking [PER Sonthi  ] about the audience with the King last night . 
Who had attended ? 
He said [ORG Privy Council President  ] [PER Prem Tinsulanonda  ] had brought him , Supreme Commander [PER Ruangroj  ] and Navy Commander [PER Sathiraphan  ] in to meet the King . 
[PER Sonthi  ] stressed that they had been summoned to the palace ; he had not sought the audience . 
He said the King was relaxed and happy , smiling throughout . 
He provided no further details. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Turning to the [LOC US  ] reaction , I reminded him of our conversation , August 31 , when I told him any military action would result in immediate suspension of assistance programs such as [ORG IMET  ] , [ORG FMF  ] and numerous others . 
I told him he could expect us to announce such a measure shortly . 
He understood . 
I added that the restoration of such assistance could only come after a democratically elected government took office . 
In the meantime , I stressed that the coup group needed to make every effort to demonstrate a sincere intention to return to civilian rule as soon as possible . 
His announcement today that an interim constitution and civilian government would be installed within two weeks was a good example . 
I reiterated these points several times. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Sonthi  ] responded by saying the military had truly acted in order to improve [MISC Thai  ] democracy , not destroy it . 
The prevailing situation had become untenable . 
Had [PER Thaksin  ] only been willing to announce publicly that he would not return as Prime Minister , this action could have been avoided . 
But his unwillingness to do publicly what he had repeatedly told many privately had led people to fear that his true intention was to seek a renewed mandate and return to power . 
Thus the military had acted . 
But they did not seek sustained political power and would return to barracks as soon as possible . 
The sooner the better , I repeated . 
I told him to expect fairly broad international criticism , as military coups were generally seen as a thing of the past. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Was he going to seize [PER Thaksin  ] , s assets ? 
No , he stated flatly . 
Would [PER Thaksin  ] and his family and colleagues be allowed to return to [LOC Thailand  ] ? 
Yes , unconditionally . 
What is the officially approved [MISC English  ] rendition of the coup group , s title ? &Council for [MISC Democratic Reform Under  ] Constitutional [ORG Monarchy  ] , 8 or CDRM. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Why had the military chosen to act at this particular point in time ? 
Smiling slightly , he leaned forward. &Thaksin was at his weakest and we were at our strongest.8 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment ) [PER Sonthi  ] was relaxed and calm . 
Clearly the royal audience was the turning point last night . 
( Septel reports [PER Thaksin  ] , s defiant attitude dissolving completely when he learned of the audience . 
) For now at least , the [ORG CDRM  ] appears to be taking the high road as far as how they will treat [PER Thaksin  ] . 
We have ready access to this group and will press them to implement their announced intention to return to civilian rule as soon as possible . 
Meanwhile , a coup is a coup is a coup and we believe a strong [LOC U.S.  ] statement announcing the suspension of assistance and a call for an early return to civilian rule and eventually elections is entirely warranted and will submit suggested text via septel .
