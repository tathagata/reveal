Summary: The [ORG UNESCO Convention  ] on [ORG Cultural Diversity  ] is not on [LOC Iceland  ] 's legislative agenda ; nor has it attracted [MISC Icelandic  ] civil society or media attention . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
Post can find no reference to the [ORG United Nations Educational , Scientific  ] , and [ORG Cultural Organization  ] ( [ORG UNESCO  ] ) Convention on Promotion of the Diversity of [ORG Cultural Expressions  ] , on the agenda for the [ORG Althingi  ] ( [MISC Icelandic  ] parliament ) . 
Queried casually and following other items of business ( per ref A instructions ) , Ministry for [ORG Foreign Affairs Head of International Institutions Division  ] [PER Nikulas Hannigan  ] commented that he did not think this was an instrument that [LOC Iceland  ] would be in any rush to ratify. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
Post [ORG Public Affairs Section  ] searched the files and websites of the country 's leading newspapers -- [ORG Morgunbladid  ] , [ORG Frettabladid  ] and [ORG DV  ] -- and found no media coverage of the [ORG UNESCO  ] cultural expressions issue . 
[ORG PAS  ] also searched the webpages of [LOC Iceland  ] 's Ministry for [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] and of the [MISC Icelandic  ] Embassy in [LOC France  ] , which represents [LOC Iceland  ] in [ORG UNESCO  ] , and found no articles or press releases about the [ORG UNESCO  ] convention . 
Based on the apparent lack of interest , [ORG PAS  ] believes a [ORG PD  ] campaign on the issue would be counterproductive. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
The following information is keyed to the tracking categories provided ref A paragraph 8: <a id='parI' href='#parI'>¶</a>I . 
[ORG Legislative  ] agenda d ) not likely to get on those agendas in 2006 II . 
Media attention a ) no published/broadcast opinion for or against ratification since October III . 
Public debate a ) No [ORG NGO  ] , university , or other civil society discussions since October <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
Comment: As reported refs B and C , [LOC Iceland  ] followed the [ORG EU  ] lead in signing the Convention while to us cautiously conceding the validity of [LOC U.S.  ] criticisms . 
Given the Government 's ambivalence thus illustrated , we may expect no exception in this case to the usual achingly slow [MISC Icelandic  ] process of incorporation of treaties into domestic law . 
End comment .
