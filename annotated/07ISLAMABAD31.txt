Crocker  ] , Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Introduction and summary: During a December 29 meeting , President ( and Chief of [ORG Army Staff  ] ) [PER Musharraf  ] reinforced for [LOC U.S.  ] Chief of [ORG Army Staff  ] GEN [PER Schoomaker  ] and the Ambassador that [LOC Pakistan  ] and the [LOC U.S  ] , are in the war on terrorism together , sharing the same goals and fighting the same enemy . 
Noting that allies may sometimes see things differently or disagree on how to proceed , [PER Musharraf  ] outlined his strategy to secure [MISC Pakistani  ] territory from violent extremism and the prevent it from being used to support the insurgency in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
In [LOC Musharraf’s  ] view , the essence of the problem of ( and solution to ) the [ORG Taliban  ] insurgency lies in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ; that said , the President also acknowledged [MISC Pakistan’s  ] responsibility to prevent cross-border collusion and support from militants in [LOC Balochistan  ] and the [LOC Federally Administered Tribal Areas  ] ( [LOC FATA  ] ) . 
To date , [MISC Pakistan’s  ] primary focus has been on disrupting [MISC Islamist  ] extremists in the [LOC FATA  ] , [PER Musharraf  ] said , but the government now sees that it must make greater efforts in [LOC Balochistan  ] . 
[PER Musharraf  ] summarized his goal: [LOC Pakistan  ] checks support for the insurgency on this side of the border , so that the [ORG ISAF-led Coalition  ] can defeat the [ORG Taliban  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
While underscoring his own commitment , [PER Musharraf  ] questioned the degree to which [LOC Afghanistan  ] is willing to respond to [MISC Pakistan’s  ] needs , noting that [MISC Pakistan’s  ] request for assistance in capturing [PER Baloch  ] militant [PER Brahamdagh Bugti  ] have yet to produce any results . 
End introduction and summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Musharraf  ] was frank and forthcoming about [MISC Pakistan’s  ] on-going reassessment of its border security tactics , while underscoring his commitment to a comprehensive strategy: winning the loyalty of the local population along the border through political dialogue and socio-economic investment while using special operations forces to root out and hunt down [PER al Qaeda  ] , [ORG Taliban  ] and other anti-Coalition elements based in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Admitting that he is dissatisfied with the facts on the ground after the September 5 jirga accord in [LOC North Waziristan  ] , [PER Musharraf  ] stressed that the task ahead is not to start over from scratch , but to make the accord work and then extend it to the rest of the border -- an assessment with which Embassy [LOC Islamabad  ] agrees . 
Even as he reaffirmed his determination to secure the border region , however , [PER Musharraf  ] betrayed deep personal frustration that Karzai’s government appears to be doing little to apprehend and repatriate [PER Brahamdagh Bugti  ] , End comment . 
How to Proceed ? --------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Musharraf  ] described the three critical points underlying his strategy for enhancing border security: -- Ending cross-border support for the [ORG Taliban  ] in [LOC Afghanistan  ] -- Closing [MISC Afghan  ] refugee camps in [LOC Balochistan  ] and the [LOC North West Frontier Province  ] ( [ORG NWFP  ] ) -- Targeting al [PER Qaeda  ] and [ORG Taliban  ] senior leaders who have established themselves on the [MISC Pakistani  ] side of the border . 
In order to stop militants from unlawfully crossing into [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Pakistan  ] will selectively mine and fence the border . 
The President has tasked the Army’s Director General of [ORG Military Operations  ] to be prepare to brief an implementation plan that would be deployed on a test basis . 
Other [MISC Pakistani  ] officials have been directed to devise a strategy to close the [LOC Pir Alazai  ] refugee camp in [LOC Balochistan  ] ISLAMABAD 00000031 002 OF 003 and to significantly improve monitoring of access to and activities with the three other most troubling camps. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Finally , [PER Musharraf  ] said that he had directed [MISC Pakistan’s  ] security forces that the government must proactively clean the al [PER Qaeda  ] and [ORG Taliban  ] presence out of the border region , while simultaneously expanding the political dialogue with the local population . 
We are now engaged on strengthening enforcement of the [ORG North Waziristan Agency  ] jirga accord , the President said , and seeking a similar accommodation with tribal leaders in [LOC South Waziristan  ] . 
[PER Musharraf  ] acknowledged that some of the government’s interlocutors in [LOC North Waziristan  ] might be considered problematic from an outsider’s perspective ( a tacit recognition of international criticism of the government’s willingness to include local militant commanders and “taliban” in the jirga negotiations ) , but these are the people that must be enlisted if [MISC Pakistani  ] authorities are to break the ties to the insurgency in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Musharraf  ] stressed that the [ORG Special Operations Task Force  ] must act more forcefully in targeting al [PER Qaeda  ] and [ORG Taliban  ] commanders in the tribal agencies ( a use of force addressed in the [LOC North Waziristan  ] accord ) ; senior Army staff will brief him on January 5 on plans to step up this engagement . 
Need for [MISC Coordination Across  ] the [ORG Durrand Line  ] --------------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Having outlined [MISC Pakistan’s  ] efforts to enhance security in the border regions , President [PER Musharraf  ] told GEN [PER Schoomaker  ] that he is deeply frustrated that the Government of [LOC Afghanistan  ] has not been responsive to greater bilateral cooperation . 
In fact , [PER Musharraf  ] argued , [LOC Afghanistan  ] is supporting terrorist , specifically the violent [PER Baloch  ] nationalist insurgency led by [PER Brahamdagh Bugti  ] , who [PER Musharraf  ] claims shifts between [LOC Kabul  ] and [LOC Kandahar  ] . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] cannot tolerate the increase in terrorist attacks seen in [LOC Balochistan  ] over recent months . 
Despite pressing President [PER Karzai  ] directly for assistance in repatriating [PER Bugti  ] to face charges in [LOC Pakistan  ] and sharing [MISC Pakistan’s  ] frustration over Bugti’s apparent safe haven in [LOC Afghanistan  ] with a parade of international officials ( [ORG ISAF  ] GEN Richards , [PER A/S Boucher  ] , etc . 
) , [PER Musharraf  ] said , nothing is being done to address the problem . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] supports its allies in the fight against terrorism and expects the same support when it comes to apprehending terrorists who target [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
Warming to his topic , [PER Musharraf  ] shared his anger over President Karzai’s anti-Pakistan public remarks in December , observing that he had been on the verge of calling a press conference to retaliate in kind until his staff intervened in the interest of dampening the unhelpful cross-border rhetoric. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Despite [LOC Musharraf’s  ] personal frustration with his [MISC Afghan  ] counterpart , he commended reports that [PER Karzai  ] wishes to arm local militias in [LOC Afghanistan  ] southern and southeastern provinces as an idea worthy of consideration . 
The concept of arming local tribal leaders to stand with the government against the [ORG Taliban  ] might work , [PER Musharraf  ] said , if [PER Karzai  ] is working with the right people . 
( Note: We are not sure whether the President was referring to current efforts to enhance Afghanistan’s auxiliary police service or to Karzai’s spring 2006 push for provincial governors to raise their own militias . 
It is equally difficult to judge whether [PER Musharraf  ] was sincere in his endorsement or simply trying to say something positive after the heated criticism of Kabul’s failure to respond to [MISC Pakistan’s  ] requests to apprehend [PER Bugti  ] . 
End note . 
) [PER Musharraf  ] said that he had accepted an offer by ISLAMABAD 00000031 003 OF 003 [ORG EU  ] representative [ORG Vendrell  ] to serve as an informal communication bridge to President [PER Karzai  ] . 
[LOC Musharraf’s  ] first message to [PER Karzai  ] via the [ORG Vendrell  ] channel is that the cross-border aspersions and accusations must stop so that both sides can focus their energies and resources on defeating their common enemy -- the [MISC Taliban.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) Post has shared the information in this cable directly with [ORG Emb Kabul  ] .
