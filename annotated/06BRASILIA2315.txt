( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: Wednesday and Thursday , Nov. 1 and 2 , were two particularly bad days to be an airline worker or passenger in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
The national holiday on Nov. 2 , start of a long weekend for many travelers , saw frayed tempers and more than one fracas in airports throughout the country as flights were cancelled or severely delayed , sometimes by more than 20 hours . 
According to several media accounts , air traffic controllers ( [ORG ATCs  ] ) , frustrated by ongoing human resource issues that have percolated to the surface since the [ORG Gol  ] flight 1907 crash in September , have slowed work rates even further in protest of what they see as egregious hours and overall " inhumane " working conditions . 
The [ORG Gol  ] crash has caused 10 [ORG Brazilian Air Force  ] ( [ORG FAB  ] ) [ORG ATCs  ] who were on duty at the [ORG Air Defense  ] and [ORG Air Traffic Control Center  ] ( [ORG CINDACTA-I  ] ) in [LOC Brasilia  ] at the time to be put on administrative leave , initially stated for psychological evaluation . 
Indeed , [MISC ATCs'  ] workload has increased in quantity over the past few years without commensurate increase in staffing . 
The situation has been complicated by a police investigation into the circumstances surrounding the [ORG Gol  ] crash , which could in theory put these suspended [ORG ATCs  ] in jeopardy of criminal charges should they be shown to have been grossly negligent in executing their duties . 
The [ORG FAB  ] currently is blocking the police from taking depositions from the suspended [ORG ATC  ] staff . 
The potential criminal investigation by federal police of these suspended [MISC ATCs--an  ] investigation that is currently being blocked by the [ORG Air Force--is  ] a likely contributing factor to the crisis . 
Military sources tell us , however , that [ORG FAB  ] controllers , while working slower , are merely sticking to the 14-aircraft-per-ATC , [ORG International Civil Aviation Organization  ] ( [ORG ICAO  ] ) standard . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] has issued a warden message for all [LOC U.S.  ] citizens in country advising them of potential travel delays , and regional travelers should be made aware of the situation . 
End Summary . 
BY THE NUMBERS <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) More than 600 flights on Thursday , November 2 were delayed , or canceled altogether , as airports around [LOC Brazil  ] grappled with the [MISC ATCs'  ] " work-to-rule " campaign . 
The [ORG Brazilian Air Force  ] , which oversees the controllers , intervened after confirming at around 3 [ORG AM  ] that the [ORG ATCs  ] , most of whom are active duty [ORG Air Force  ] personnel , had increased the time between takeoffs from the normal interval of three minutes between flights to 30 minutes . 
This created a cascade effect as flight after flight was delayed ; chaos ensued after the normal shift change for controllers , the hour at which air traffic intensity increases . 
The [ORG Air Force  ] called in 149 controllers to work as an emergency measure , and under penalty of prison for insubordination . 
Of the 149 controllers called in at 5:30 [ORG AM  ] , some were allowed to depart at 10:00 a.m. , after replacements were confirmed . 
112 worked in shifts of eight hours to try to regularize flights in the [ORG CINDACTA-I  ] air traffic control region , which monitors the areas of [LOC Brasilia  ] , [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] , and [LOC Minas Gerais  ] , through which 85 percent of air traffic passes . 
SHIFTING THE BLAME <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) According to the press , Commander of the [ORG Air Force General  ] Luiz [PER Carlos Bueno  ] said that by the afternoon , air traffic control was back to normal , and any further delays could not be attributed to the system . 
" There is now not a single restriction . 
If there is a delay , it is not because of air traffic control , it must be a problem with the airlines , " he affirmed . 
Nonetheless , the [MISC Brazilian  ] media reported that the chaotic situation continued throughout the day . 
Air traffic was , in effect , paralyzed . 
As an example , a flight from [LOC Aracaju  ] airport in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , which was supposed to have [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00002315 002 OF 003 landed at 8:30 PM on Wednesday , only landed at 5:00 PM on Thursday . 
PASSENGERS REACH THE LIMITS OF THEIR PATIENCE . . . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Passengers physically revolted , in some instances , against the delays and lack of communication by the airports and airlines . 
In [LOC Confins Airport  ] in the state of [LOC Mato Grosso  ] , about 35 passengers tried to invade a plane , and were only contained through [ORG Federal Police  ] action . 
In [LOC Rio  ] , clients partially destroyed a [ORG Gol Airlines  ] counter at [PER Tom Jobim  ] airport . 
In [LOC Porto Alegre  ] 's airport in the state of [LOC Rio Grande  ] do Sul , police officers were called to control interactions between passengers and airline employees . 
At least 100 flights were late an average of three hours in [LOC Cumbica Airport  ] , in the state of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
Television and print news coverage at each airport showed long lines , crowds of angry passengers at the counters dealing with harried airline employees , and the more passive passengers endeavoring to wait out the situation by sleeping on the floor . 
. . .IN RESPONSE TO [MISC BRAZILIAN  ] AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL'S OWN LIMITS <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Air Force Brigadier Bueno  ] insisted on attributing the air traffic control crisis , which yesterday marked its seventh day , to unforeseen psychological problems suffered by the controllers after the [ORG Gol Flight  ] 1907 crash . 
" The big problem that happened is that a very large quantity [ of controllers ] felt bad , " said [PER Bueno  ] . 
" People have to overcome psychologically , and not let themselves get down to the point of not working , " criticized the general , denying that the threat of penalty of prison could aggravate the situation . 
" There is no threat whatsoever to anyone , all is being done in according with regulation , " he said . 
Ex-controllers interviewed in [LOC Brasilia  ] claimed the contrary , saying there was , indeed , intimidation . 
Privately , some sources familiar with the system indicate that flight delays have often been blamed on weather or other factors when in fact they are due to air traffic control capacity . 
[ORG GOL FLIGHT  ] 1907 , OR ENDEMIC PROBLEMS ? <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The impact of the crash of [ORG Gol Flight  ] 1907 cannot be overestimated , but neither can the fact that the crash may have resulted , at least partially , due to already existing problems in the air traffic control system in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Air traffic within the country has increased greatly in the last several years , but the air traffic control system has remained both undermanned and overworked . 
As per [ORG ICAO  ] regulations , [ORG ATCs  ] are not supposed to control more than 14 aircraft each , but sources within the system indicate that they are often asked to do more , and work longer hours , due to the lack of human resources . 
In addition , according to the November 1 press , the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] has known since 2003 about the risk that the air traffic control system might collapse , and had recommended shifting some of the air traffic out of [ORG CINDACTA  ] I to the other [ORG CINDACTAs  ] . 
No one in an official capacity is publicly saying that the air traffic control system had a role in the [ORG Gol  ] crash , but to date , the [ORG FAB  ] has not allowed federal police investigators to talk to the suspended [ORG ATCs  ] , and privately some theorize that air traffic control was at fault . 
In addition , focus on the criminal investigation of the Legacy pilots involved in the crash is hampering , or at least complicating , the safety investigation . 
TOO LITTLE , TOO LATE ? <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) And , while the [ORG FAB  ] is now implementing changes , the [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00002315 003 OF 003 workload increase has been escalating for at least a few years and its reaction seems more reactive than proactive . 
For example , only at the end of October , 15 [ORG ATCs  ] from other [ORG Air Force  ] locations already familiar with the air traffic control center in [LOC Brasilia  ] ( [ORG CINDACTA  ] I ) were called to begin a 90-hour requalifying course . 
They are to supplement the [ORG CINDACTA  ] I controller workforce . 
On November 1 , major organizations involved with air traffic issues such as the [ORG Airports Authority  ] ( [ORG INFRAERO  ] ) , the [ORG National Civil Aviation Authority  ] ( [ORG ANAC  ] ) , and the [ORG National Syndicate of Air Carriers  ] ( [ORG SNEA  ] ) , met to discuss rearrangement of commercial air traffic routes to relieve pressure on controllers , airports , and the entire [MISC Brazilian  ] air traffic system . 
On November 6 , the [ORG FAB  ] is expected to publish requirements for a public exam with the goal to contract more civilian air controllers . 
If an applicant passes the exam , he/she would then take a course given by the [ORG Institute of Aerospace Control  ] ( [ORG ICEA  ] ) in [LOC Sao Jose  ] dos [LOC Campos  ] , to fill 64 vacancies in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
How long these vacancies have been on the books remains unclear . 
The [ORG FAB  ] has already recalled military [ORG ATCs  ] from its retired reserves to supplement [ORG CINDACTA  ] I ; they are to report to duty after undergoing a requalifying course . 
All of these efforts , while positive steps , may be too little , too late . 
[ORG SYSTEMIC CHANGE  ] AFOOT <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Another complicating factor is that these changes will actually require a complete overhaul in the system , down to the basic structure . 
The four regulatory air defense and air traffic control centers , [MISC CINDACTAS  ] I , II , III , and [ORG IV  ] , which together cover the entire country , have only been manned to date by [ORG Air Force  ] active duty personnel . 
Civilian controllers are very few in number and are in some airport towers , but not in the [MISC CINDACTAS  ] , and the military is in charge even at the airport towers . 
However , the reservists and others being called to re-qualify or newly qualify as [ORG ATCs  ] will be considered civilian employees . 
What kind of internal tensions will be exacerbated or revealed by these shifts is not yet known , or even if civilian controllers will be allowed to work in the [ORG CINDACTAs  ] . 
THE [ORG VARIG  ] ISSUE <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Another potential factor includes the collapse of [ORG Varig  ] airlines and to date , the lack of full assumption of the former [ORG Varig  ] routes , particularly the international ones . 
Current flights are stretched to full passenger capacity and often overbooked ; but increasing the number of flights back up to full frequency would only add further stress to the system . 
This factor may or may not be being taken into sufficient account along with the deficiencies in the current air traffic control system . 
10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: How all of the proposed changes and new staffing will impact the future of [MISC Brazilian  ] air traffic control , and what potential problems will occur along the way , remain to be seen . 
For the moment , the crisis has seemingly been alleviated , due to a negotiated settlement reached this morning between the [ORG FAB  ] and the [ORG ATCs  ] . 
However , the settlement will take time to implement , and overall this is likely a case of postponement rather than true resolution . 
End comment .
