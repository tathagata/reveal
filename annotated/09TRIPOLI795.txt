REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary: Dr. [PER Ahmed Hesnawy  ] , head of [LOC Libya  ] 's chemical weapons destruction program , defended [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG Chemical Weapons Convention  ] ( [ORG CWC  ] ) extension request , arguing that a grassroots environmental campaign and civil defense concerns regarding possible accidents or leaks required additional time to meet [LOC Libya  ] 's obligations to destroy its chemical weapons stockpile and convert [ORG Rabta  ] 1 and <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
Except for the alleged grassroots environmental movement , most of [PER Hesnawy  ] 's argument seemed plausible . 
[PER Hesnawy  ] also provided a detailed update on [LOC Libya  ] 's progress . 
Plans are in place with the [MISC Italian  ] company [ORG SIPSA  ] to build the [ORG Rabta Toxic Chemicals Destruction Facility  ] in time for destruction to commence November 1 , and work is progressing with the company [LOC PharmChem  ] on the [ORG Rabta  ] conversion project . 
[PER Hesnawy  ] said he was prepared to deliver a detailed presentation of [LOC Libya  ] 's progress during the October 12 Executive Council session of the [ORG Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  ] ( [ORG OPCW  ] ) . 
[LOC Libya  ] also briefed representatives of the [MISC French  ] ( jointly with post ) and [LOC UK  ] ( separately ) embassies here on its progress . 
End Summary . 
[PER HESNAWY  ] JUSTIFIES EXTENSION REQUEST 2 . 
( S ) During a September 30 meeting , Pol/Econ Chief jointly delivered ref a demarche with [MISC French  ] [ORG DCM  ] to the head of the chemical weapons destruction program at [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Chemical Weapons  ] ( [ORG CW  ] ) Authority , Dr. [PER Ahmed Hesnawy  ] . 
During the meeting , [PER Hesnawy  ] also provided a detailed briefing on his progress toward meeting [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG Chemical Weapons Convention  ] ( [ORG CWC  ] ) commitments . 
[MISC Libyan  ] [ORG MFA International Organizations Officials Murat Humaima  ] , and [PER Tajouri Shiradi  ] also attended the meeting. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [PER Hesnawy  ] gave a long explanation of the reasons for the extension request , including resistance from the local community when construction work began at the building site for the [ORG Rabta Toxic Chemicals Destruction Facility  ] . 
He explained that local residents complained about the idea of a [ORG CW  ] destruction facility being built in their neighborhood and alerted environmental authorities to their concerns ; then " all hell broke loose , " he said . 
[PER Hesnawy  ] said that the " environmental agency " began asking tough questions regarding the emissions that would be released by the facility and requested verification of a number of control standards . 
[PER Hesnawy  ] bragged that he had successfully answered the questions and had come to an agreement with the agency . 
[ Comment: Given tight [MISC Libyan  ] Government controls over national security facilities and programs , we find it hard to believe that a grassroots movement could affect [MISC Libyan  ] policy or action on a sensitive program such as the [ORG Rabta  ] facility . 
End comment . 
] 3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Hesnawy  ] then explained that the next problem he confronted was with the " civil defense people , " who were concerned about securing the transfer of the chemical weapons and precursor materials from the storage to destruction sites . 
They demanded that emergency procedures be developed to ensure quick and appropriate response in the event of an accident or leak , which according to [PER Hesnawy  ] , has created additional delays . 
[ Note: The [LOC UK  ] [ORG DCM  ] , who visited the storage facility earlier this year , told P/E Chief that the containers currently housing the material were in fact leaking when he observed them . 
End note . 
] 4 . 
( S ) On a positive note , [PER Hesnawy  ] reported that the ground at the site has been leveled , fencing and gates have been put in place , and water and energy sources have been built for the facility . 
A pipeline approximately 250 meters from the site will supply water from the [ORG Great Manmade River  ] , and a power station about two kilometers away will support " an 11 kilo volt electricity line " to the facility . 
UPDATE ON [ORG SIPSA  ] WORK 5 . 
( S ) [PER Hesnawy  ] said that he had met with [MISC Italian  ] company [ORG SIPSA  ] September 29 ( ref B ) and emphasized the necessity of building the structure in an efficient way , to enable [LOC Libya  ] to meet its [ORG CWC  ] deadlines . 
By his estimation , since the destruction must commence on November 1 , 2010 , with the destruction of one-percent of the [MISC Libyan  ] [ORG CW  ] stock , the facility must be ready for operations by October 29 , 2010 . 
He thought that destruction of one-percent of the [ORG CW  ] would take one day to complete . 
In order to meet those deadlines , [PER Hesnawy  ] and the [ORG SIPSA  ] designers agreed that the facility should be composed of 90% steel , which [ORG TRIPOLI  ] 00000795 002 OF 002 would provide for faster construction . 
Furthermore , they had decided that the foundation will consist of a single platform , rather than separate , individual platforms . 
[PER Hesnawy  ] exuberantly claimed to be " convinced that [LOC Libya  ] can meet its deadlines~if there are no other delays . 
" He said that his extension request was for a total of 5-6 months , and he believed that destruction of the precursors would be completed on schedule . 
6 . 
( S ) [PER Hesnawy  ] explained that a [ORG Technical Secretariat  ] ( [ORG TS  ] ) team recently visited the sites and inspected the storage of the mustard gas and precursors , and they had agreed with his reasons for requesting the extension and destruction timeline . 
[ORG RABTA CONVERSION PROGRAM  ] 7 . 
( S ) Regarding the conversion of [ORG Rabta  ] 1 and 2 facilities , he explained that the list of equipment submitted in the amendment request had been dictated by [MISC European  ] rules , since the company that was working to convert the facility , [LOC PharmChem  ] , was [MISC European  ] and was designing the pharmaceutical plant according to [ORG EU  ] standards . 
REQUEST FOR SUPPORT 8 . 
( S ) [PER Hesnawy  ] requested [LOC U.S.  ] support during the October 12 Executive Council session and in weighing in with [MISC European  ] delegations . 
P/E Chief emphasized that transparency and timely reporting were absolutely essential to [LOC U.S.  ] support for [LOC Libya  ] 's requests . 
[PER Hesnawy  ] claimed that he agreed and had always been an advocate of transparency and communication on such issues . 
He said that he would be delivering the explanation of the [MISC Libyan  ] requests at the [ORG OPCW  ] Executive Council session . 
The [MISC French  ] [ORG DCM  ] was silent throughout the briefing and said he would confer with the [LOC Elysee  ] on the [MISC Libyan  ] request for support . 
[LOC UK  ] EMBASSY WARNS OF HESNAWY'S CONFIDENCE 9 . 
( S ) In a separate meeting , xxxxxxxxxxxx told P/E Chief that while the [ORG MFA  ] IO officer [PER Tajouri Shiradi  ] had made the same request for support for [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG CWC  ] requests , he did not provide as much detail on the progress of the [MISC Libyan  ] program. xxxxxxxxxxxx expressed surprise that [PER Hesnawy  ] had met with us , relating that he was an elusive character who had not wanted to meet with him in the past , even though they had worked together when xxxxxxxxxxxx had served as part of the xxxxxxxxxxxx [ORG Delegation  ] to the [ORG OPCW.  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx described [PER Hesnawy  ] as xxxxxxxxxxxx and said that while part of the [MISC Libyan  ] argument for the destruction deadline extension was credible , the other part was just talk . 
10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Bio  ] info: [PER Hesnawy  ] is a charismatic and gregarious character , who spoke fluent [MISC American  ] [MISC English  ] . 
He used [MISC American  ] expressions and slang with ease and was clearly trying to endear himself to P/E Chief . 
He said that he has been head of [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG Chemical Weapons Program  ] for the last 12 years and was intimately aware of every technical detail relating to that program . 
According to xxxxxxxxxxxx , [PER Hesnawy  ] may be working with [ORG National Security Advisor  ] , [PER Muatassim al-Qadhafi  ] , on missile purchase requests . 
11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: The [MISC Libyans  ] made an effort to meet with us on short notice and were ready to provide detailed information about the status of their [ORG CWC  ] commitments and requests . 
While most of the argument for the extension was plausible , certain aspects of [PER Hesnawy  ] 's justification ( i.e. , protests from the local population ) do not seem to fit with the [MISC Libyan  ] political environment . 
The fact that we received significantly more access than the [LOC UK  ] Embassy seems to indicate that the [MISC Libyan  ] Government appreciates the importance of continued WMD progress to our bilateral relationship .
