Summary <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [PER Jose Maria Aznar  ] did not participate in the [ORG Popular Party  ] 's campaign for the June 13 [ORG EU  ] parliamentary election . 
With the [MISC Socialists  ] making the war in [LOC Iraq  ] and distancing [MISC Spanish  ] foreign policy from the [LOC US  ] their central campaign issues , [ORG Popular Party  ] leaders decided that [PER Aznar  ] was too radioactive to help in the campaign . 
[PER Aznar  ] insiders tell us that [PER Aznar  ] recognized this as well , but is confident time will ultimately vindicate his policies . 
Many in the [ORG PP  ] regarded [PER Aznar  ] 's May visit to the [LOC US  ] , which included a private meeting with President [PER Bush  ] , as inopportune . 
They believe the visit give the [MISC Socialists  ] ammunition in their efforts to portray the [ORG PP  ] as a tool of the [LOC US  ] . 
Following his [LOC US  ] visit , [PER Aznar  ] avoided the media and focused on presiding over the [ORG PP  ] think tank ( [ORG FAES  ] ) and learning [MISC English  ] in preparation for speaking engagements . 
On June 13 , the [ORG Popular Party  ] succeeded in beating expectations and came within two points of the [MISC Socialists  ] in the [ORG EU  ] election . 
End Summary . 
[ORG Aznar Radioactive  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Aznar  ] 's longtime associate and former State Secretary for Communication [PER Alfredo Timmermans  ] told us recently that [PER Aznar  ] 's decision to play no public role in the June 13 [ORG EU  ] parliament election campaign was his choice , but that it also reflected the preference of [ORG PP  ] leaders . 
The [MISC Socialists  ] ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) sought a repeat of their March 14 surprise election victory and played up themes that had worked for them , notably opposition to the [LOC Iraq  ] war and [PER Aznar  ] 's close relations with the [LOC US  ] . 
[PER Timmermans  ] said that [PER Aznar  ] was fully aware that he was politically radioactive and , as a result , kept a low profile . 
His only public activities were to appear at signings of new his book recounting his years in office . 
( [PER Timmermans  ] noted sales are going well and the book is now in its second printing . 
) " Photo of the [LOC Azores  ] " <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) A Socialist refrain from the [ORG EU  ] parliament election campaign was the need to correct " the photo of the [LOC Azores  ] . 
" To them , the March 2003 [LOC Azores  ] summit stands for committing [LOC Spain  ] to an [LOC Iraq  ] conflict that the [MISC Spanish  ] public wanted no part of and for allying with the [LOC US  ] instead of [LOC France  ] and [LOC Germany.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) For this reason , there was unease in the [ORG PP  ] when [PER Aznar  ] visited the [LOC US  ] in May 2004 , only weeks after stepping down from office . 
While [ORG PP  ] leaders stated that [PER Aznar  ] had a right to travel where he wished , many , including [PER Aznar  ] loyalists , felt that given the [ORG EU  ] election [PER Aznar  ] should have postponed the trip until after June 13 . 
[PER Timmermans  ] told us that many in the [ORG PP  ] wanted [PER Aznar  ] to " stay home and say nothing . 
" [PER Timmermans  ] said [PER Aznar  ] understood that he is , for the present , a divisive figure but that he is confident time will vindicate his policies toward [LOC Iraq  ] and the [LOC US  ] . 
[PER Timmermans  ] said [PER Aznar  ] was buoyed by the warm reception he received in the [LOC US  ] and , in particular , by his meeting with President [PER Bush  ] . 
[PER Timmermans  ] contrasted this warmth with the reticence [PER Aznar  ] has encountered from some in the [ORG Popular Party  ] since March 14 . 
[PER Aznar  ] 's Messages to the [LOC US  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Timmermans  ] noted that [PER Aznar  ] had expressed concern to President [PER Bush  ] that the March 11 Madrid terrorist attacks had sent a message to terrorists that they can influence elections . 
[PER Aznar  ] urged vigilance in advance of [LOC US  ] elections . 
[PER Aznar  ] believes al [MISC Qaeda  ] inspired terrorists might also target countries like [LOC Italy  ] where public opinion is vulnerable . 
[PER Timmermans  ] said [PER Aznar  ] believes the [LOC US  ] has to brace for continued bad news from [LOC Iraq  ] and came away with the impression that some [LOC US  ] observers may be too optimistic about the medium term outlook . 
[PER Timmermans  ] said an election defeat by President [PER Bush  ] in November would be read , rightly or wrongly , in [LOC Spain  ] as a defeat for the [ORG Popular Party  ] and would give the [MISC Socialists  ] a boost. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Timmermans  ] said the [ORG PP  ] , [PER Aznar  ] included , continues to be " astonished " by the chain of events from the March 11 terrorist attacks to surprise election defeat on March 14 . 
Many [ORG Popular Party  ] members , [PER Timmermans  ] said , blame [PER Aznar  ] 's [LOC Iraq  ] policy for the defeat and believe [PER Aznar  ] gambled with the party 's future on [LOC Iraq  ] and lost . 
Like other [MISC Spaniards  ] ( 80 percent according to some polls ) , most [ORG PP  ] members were not sorry to see the [MISC Spanish  ] troops come home , [PER Timmermans  ] said. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Timmermans  ] underlined that [PER Aznar  ] remains unyielding in his beliefs . 
[PER Aznar  ] will continue to support the [LOC Iraq  ] war and say publicly that the Madrid terrorist attacks on March 11 brought the [MISC Socialists  ] to power . 
[PER Timmermans  ] ( speaking before June 13 ) noted that President [PER Zapatero  ] is still in the honeymoon phase and thus the [ORG PSOE  ] would have an important electoral advantage . 
[PER Zapatero  ] has not had to make any unpopular decisions and his one major decision ) to pull the troops out ) was highly popular . 
[PER Timmermans  ] said that all of [PER Zapatero  ] 's decisions are taken with one idea in mind: doing what is popular . 
[PER Aznar  ] 's Future <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Aznar  ] is confident that in the longer term , he will be vindicated , [PER Timmermans  ] said . 
However , the current period is a difficult one for the [ORG PP  ] and for [PER Aznar  ] personally . 
In the coming year , [PER Aznar  ] intends to travel frequently to the [LOC US  ] . 
While based in [LOC Spain  ] , he will make speeches to [LOC US  ] audiences and teach occasional seminars at [LOC Georgetown  ] . 
[PER Aznar  ] is working hard on his [MISC English  ] and is presiding over the [ORG Popular Party  ] think tank , [ORG FAES  ] . 
[PER Timmermans  ] said [PER Aznar  ] will make it a point to speak out in favor of the transatlantic link and the need for close relations with the [LOC United States  ] . 
June 13: [ORG PP  ] Exceeds Expectations , On [LOC Road  ] to Recovery <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG Popular Party  ] strategists told us in the run up to the June 13 election that the [ORG PP  ] goal was to keep the race close . 
None said that they expected to win , but they did hope to cut the Socialist margin . 
Polling had given the [MISC Socialists  ] a 6 to 9 point advantage . 
The June 13 result was far tighter: the [MISC Socialists  ] won by only two points . 
[ORG PP  ] leaders regard this as a relative victory . 
[PER Jorge Moragas  ] , [ORG PP  ] Director for International Affairs , told us that the result at least succeeded in giving a " shock " to the over-confidence of the [MISC Socialists  ] and is a signal the [ORG PP  ] is on the road to recovery .
