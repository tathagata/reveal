[PER Porras  ] , one of President [PER Hugo Chavez  ] 's strongest public critics , told the Ambassador that there is widespread perception among the opposition that the [ORG USG  ] softened its message against [PER Chavez  ] after the August 2004 referendum because of energy interests . 
[PER Porras  ] suggested that the [ORG USG  ] be more clear and public in its criticism of the [PER Chavez  ] administration. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Porras  ] said the international community also needs to work and speak out more to contain [PER Chavez  ] and the export of his revolution . 
[PER Porras  ] said most regional governments have deferred to [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Ignacio " Lula  ] " da [PER Silva  ] to handle [PER Chavez  ] because the two share leftist ideologies . 
[PER Lula  ] has been unwilling to engage , however , which has stymied regional efforts to contain [PER Chavez  ] , the Archbishop asserted . 
[PER Porras  ] said the [MISC Europeans  ] have been just as weak on [PER Chavez  ] , especially since the departure of [MISC Spanish  ] President [PER Jose Maria Aznar  ] . 
The Archbishop said that both [LOC Latin America  ] and [LOC Europe  ] need strong leadership from the [LOC USG.  ] ------------------------- Fighting [PER Chavez Long Term  ] ------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Porras  ] described [PER Chavez  ] as a " long-term problem . 
" He said [PER Chavez  ] will continue to dismantle civil society groups necessary to foster democratic rule: organized labor , the independent press , the business community , and the church . 
The Archbishop cited as an example the [ORG GOV  ] efforts to penetrate the [MISC Catholic  ] school system in [LOC Merida  ] . 
[ORG GOV  ] officials insisted that the [MISC Catholics  ] accept " community representatives " on their school boards , and once accepted these individuals began to push revolutionary " reforms . 
" [PER Porras  ] also noted reduced contacts with the military , which had traditionally invited him to change of command ceremonies but had not done so in more than three years. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 .

He welcomed [ORG USG  ] visits to church social programs in poor neighborhoods . 
[PER Porras  ] warned that the longer the [ORG USG  ] waits , the more successful [ORG GOV  ] will be at undermining traditional democratic organizations . 
He acknowledged an inherent conflict in his own analysis: [PER Chavez  ] is a long-term problem but the longer it takes to address , the stronger he becomes. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Porras  ] and the rest of the [MISC Catholic  ] leadership have kept low profiles since the referendum , the results of which they grudgingly accepted . 
[PER Chavez  ] has targeted the church , especially its leadership , which he sees as an ally of the previous political regime . 
[PER Chavez  ] has a long-running conflict as well with [PER Porras  ] , who was among the first to accuse [PER Chavez  ] of authoritarian tendencies . 
Rivalries aside , [PER Porras  ] is in touch with current domestic and international thought on [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
The [MISC Catholic  ] social projects [PER Porras  ] seeks to promote , while not on the scale of the [ORG GOV  ] 's " missions , " do have a history of solidarity with [LOC Venezuela  ] 's poor that is not so easily undone , despite [PER Chavez  ] 's efforts .
