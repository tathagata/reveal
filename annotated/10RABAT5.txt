( [ORG SBU  ] ) General [PER Ward  ] expressed satisfaction with his visit to [LOC Morocco  ] , following recent visits to [LOC Algeria  ] , [LOC Libya  ] and [LOC Mali  ] and serving to show equality in dealing with the militaries of a region that does not tend toward regional cooperation .

( C/NF ) At the signing ceremony , General [PER Bennani  ] warmly welcomed General [PER Ward  ] , s visit both professionally and personally , expressing his esteem for the vision and progress with [ORG U.S. Africa Command  ] . 
He emphasized that King [PER Mohammed VI  ] had designated him to sign the [ORG CISMOA  ] on behalf of [LOC Morocco  ] , with the understanding that the agreement was integral to the full utilization of the [MISC F-16  ] by the [MISC Moroccan  ] [ORG Royal Air Force  ] , but also with a vision to future cooperation for integration of technologies and weapons systems for the navy and army . 
He further reiterated previous statements that the King wished the [MISC Moroccan  ] [ORG Royal Armed Forces  ] to be on par with [MISC American  ] forces in order to permit full integration and interoperability should the commanders-in-chief of both countries decide to employ their forces in a coalition or combined operation. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) General [PER Ward  ] returned the warm greetings and stated that the agreement was both a symbol of the relationship between the two countries and signal of their commitment to mutual security . 
He affirmed that the agreement would have broad application across the entirety of the [MISC Moroccan  ] military , and would open doors to future technologies and cooperation not yet envisioned in mutually beneficial ways to guarantee stability and peace. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) General [PER Ward  ] explained that teams would visit [LOC Morocco  ] in January and February to discuss implementation of the [ORG CISMOA  ] and implementation meetings would take place three times per year thereafter .

( [ORG S  ] ) Turning to regional issues , [ORG General Ward  ] asked General [PER Bennani  ] how he saw the regional threat from [PER Al Qu  ] , aida in the Lands of the [MISC Islamic  ] [ORG Maghreb  ] ( [ORG AQIM  ] ) and narcotics traffickers . 
[PER Bennani  ] responded that narcotics were not making their way into [LOC Morocco  ] . 
However , [ORG AQIM  ] posed a serious threat to countries like [LOC Mauritania  ] and [LOC Mali  ] that could not counter the terrorists . 
General [PER Bennani  ] explained that he was intimately familiar with [LOC Mauritania  ] , s geography and topography and that the country was not capable of controlling its territory . 
Brigadier General [PER Abdellah Hamdoun  ] , the Director of Military Intelligence , offered that [LOC Mali  ] lacked the means to counter [ORG AQIM  ] . 
General [PER Ward  ] then briefed General [PER Bennani  ] , [ORG Air Force  ] Commander Major General [PER Ahmed Boutaleb  ] and other general officers on the [LOC U.S.  ] plan to gather intelligence about [ORG AQIM  ] in [LOC Mali  ] and [LOC Mauritania  ] and requested overflight clearance for a [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC EP-3  ] aircraft .

General [PER Boutaleb  ] added that the [ORG Air Force  ] and the General [PER Staff  ] would study the overflight request and respond quickly. ------ [LOC Guinea  ] ------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) General [PER Ward  ] next noted that [LOC Morocco  ] was hosting some important guests . 
General [PER Bennani  ] asked if he was referring to President [PER Sarkozy  ] or former President [PER Chirac  ] . 
General [PER Ward  ] replied he was referring to [MISC Guinean  ] junta leader [PER Dadis Camara  ] and [MISC Guinean  ] Minister of [ORG National Defense Sekouba Konate  ] , asking about their conditions . 
Surprisingly , [PER Bennani  ] had no information about either and did not even know that General [PER Konate  ] was in [LOC Morocco  ] ) - although he had attended the [MISC Moroccan  ] military academy and had strong ties to [MISC Moroccan  ] leaders . 
General [PER Ward  ] strongly urged that [LOC Morocco  ] keep [PER Dadis Camara  ] as long as possible . 
General [PER Bennani  ] noted that [PER Camara  ] was in [LOC Morocco  ] on humanitarian terms , and responded only that many [MISC African  ] leaders come to the [PER Mohammed V Military Hospital  ] in [LOC Rabat  ] for free medical care . 
General [PER Hamdoun  ] suggested that [PER Konate  ] was weak and might not be fit to serve as head of state for an extended period. ------- Comment ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) General [PER Bennani  ] , who can be very prickly , appeared upbeat throughout the ceremony and related discussions . 
The [ORG CISMOA  ] brings a level of [LOC U.S.  ] scrutiny and procedure to the control and dissemination of the cryptographic and keying material associated with [LOC U.S.  ] weapons systems that can appear intrusive to a sovereign nation . 
However , the General seemed thoughtful as he digested the discussion of the upcoming implementation and programmatic activities that would take place in the coming months and years . 
He and the rest of the senior military leadership seemed totally uninformed about patients at the military hospital . 
Moreover , General [PER Bennani  ] , s comments about narcotics transiting [LOC Morocco  ] were at odds with comments from key civilian leaders who express significant concern about this matter. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In sum , General [PER Ward  ] , s visit accomplished the necessary act of signing the document integral to full and timely implementation of the [MISC F-16  ] program in [LOC Morocco  ] , and reinforced the already strong relationship between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Moroccan  ] militaries . 
The upcoming year will see a full slate of security cooperation activities between the two militaries , building to the delivery of the first [MISC F-16  ] in July 2011 .
