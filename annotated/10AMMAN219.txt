END SUMMARY . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] Issues ------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC Jordan  ] has already made a significant contribution of forces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( ref B ) , currently numbered at 850 troops , which includes an infantry battalion , a special operations company , and a field hospital . 
[PER Prince Faisal  ] and Minister [PER Hasan  ] will likely make a number of offers for increased participation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Specifically , we expect them to offer: <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Training for [MISC Afghan  ] Clerics -- Minister [PER Hasan  ] has indicated an interest in offering a one-year training program for [MISC Afghan  ] clerics and religious leaders in moderate [MISC Islam  ] to counter extremist ideologies . 
The program would be hosted at [ORG Al Albayt University  ] in [LOC Mafraq  ] , [LOC Jordan  ] , and has been approved by [PER Prince Ghazi  ] bin [MISC Muhammed  ] , the King 's special advisor on religious affairs . 
( Note: [PER Prince Ghazi  ] is also the author of the [ORG Amman Message  ] on moderate [MISC Islam  ] and the [MISC Common Word  ] on outreach to [MISC Christians  ] . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Police Training -- [PER Prince Faisal  ] and Minister [PER Hasan  ] will offer to train [ORG Afghan National Police  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) at training facilities in [LOC Jordan  ] or by sending [ORG Mobile Training Teams  ] ( [ORG MTT  ] ) to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
-- Background: [LOC Jordan  ] has established a record of effective training of regional police and para-military forces at the [ORG Jordan International Police Training Center  ] ( [ORG JIPTC  ] ) . 
In 2005-2007 , the [ORG Jordanian Public Security Directorate  ] ( [ORG PSD  ] ) trained over 53,000 [ORG Iraqi National Police  ] . 
Since 2008 , [LOC Jordan  ] has trained over 3,500 members of the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] 's [ORG gendarmerie-like National Security Forces  ] ( [ORG NSF  ] ) and [ORG Presidential Guard  ] , resulting in partial withdrawal of [MISC Israeli  ] security from four key [LOC West Bank  ] cities. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Additional [LOC Field Hospital  ] -- [PER Prince Faisal  ] and Minister [PER Hasan  ] will offer to send an additional military field hospital to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[LOC Jordan  ] already operates one hospital in [LOC Qalat  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] which has treated over 750,000 patients since 2003 . 
[LOC Jordan  ] also maintains field hospitals in [LOC Fallujah  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] and in [LOC Gaza  ] , and will soon open one in [LOC Haiti  ] ( ref A ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Additional Ground Forces -- Senior [MISC Jordanian  ] military officials have in the past mentioned their interest in making sizeable increases in their contribution of ground forces in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and recently reaffirmed their interest to the [LOC U.K.  ] and [ORG NATO  ] officials . 
[PER Prince Faisal  ] may make such an offer in [LOC Washington  ] . 
-- Background: Feedback from the field indicates that [MISC Jordanian  ] forces already deployed have been highly effective at key leader engagement in [MISC Afghan  ] villages , forging valuable relationships that give these leaders a promising alternative to [MISC Taliban  ] affiliation . 
At the same time , a [MISC Jordanian  ] legal requirement that soldiers deployed overseas must receive approximately 1600 USD per month in combat pay has been pushing the [ORG Jordanian Armed Forces  ] ( [ORG JAF  ] ) deeper into deficit . 
The [ORG GOJ  ] has repeatedly requested assistance from us to meet [LOC AMMAN  ] 00000219 002 OF 002 this obligation , a request the [ORG USG  ] cannot fulfill . 
CENTCOM has had preliminary discussions with the [MISC U.A.E.  ] to explore it as a potential source of donor funding , but so far funds have not been forthcoming. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Special Operations Training  ] -- [PER Prince Faisal  ] may offer to train [MISC Afghan  ] counter-terrorism ( [LOC CT  ] ) or special operations forces ( [ORG SOF  ] ) . 
-- Background: [LOC Jordan  ] has developed strong [ORG SOF  ] and [LOC CT  ] skills within its security forces and currently has a [ORG SOF  ] unit deployed in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( [ORG TF111  ] ) . 
In May 2009 [LOC Jordan  ] opened the King [ORG Abdullah Special Operations Training Center  ] ( [ORG KASOTC  ] ) as an intended center of excellence for [ORG SOF  ] training . 
Although [ORG KASOTC  ] has hosted regional joint exercises , it has yet to host a full-length regional training course. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Fighter Jets and Helicopters  ] -- In previous meetings , [PER Prince Faisal  ] has offered to send [MISC F-16  ] fighter jets and [MISC UH-60  ] helicopters with pilots to conduct combat missions . 
-- Background: [ORG Air Force Central Command  ] ( [ORG AFCENT  ] ) Commander [PER LTG Hostage  ] met [PER Prince Faisal  ] in [LOC Amman  ] on January 19 and indicated to him that such a contribution would not be helpful at this time . 
He assessed that [MISC Jordanian  ] [MISC F-16  ] and [MISC UH-60  ] pilots do not have sufficient combat flight experience . 
In addition , the fleet would require point-to-point support from the [LOC U.S.  ] for maintenance , repair , and in missions . 
[LOC Iraq  ] Issues ----------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Prince Faisal  ] may also raise the following issues related to [MISC Iraq:  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Sale of [ORG Fighter Jets  ] -- [PER Prince Faisal  ] has previously indicated his interest in selling [LOC Jordan  ] 's Peace Falcon I ( [MISC PF-I  ] ) [MISC F-16  ] [ORG Fighter Jets  ] to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The sale is intended to make way for an acquisition of fourteen new [MISC F-16  ] jets from [MISC European  ] partners with increased avionics capabilities . 
A recent assessment by the [ORG Air Force International Affairs Division  ] indicated that the acquisition , and an accompanying mid-life upgrade to the remainder of its [MISC F-16  ] fleet , would cost [LOC Jordan  ] well over $1 billion , including training and maintenance support. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Training [MISC Iraqi  ] Pilots -- As [LOC Iraq  ] establishes its [ORG Air Force  ] capabilities , [LOC Jordan  ] has indicated interest in training [MISC Iraqi  ] pilots . 
In his January 19 meeting [PER LTG Hostage  ] indicated that the [LOC U.S.  ] was exploring conduct that training itself. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Fighter Weapons School  ] -- [ORG Jordan  ] plans to establish a center of excellence for fighter pilot training and may seek [LOC U.S.  ] assistance with the project . 
However , the [ORG USG  ] already supports such a facility in the region , the [ORG Gulf Air War Center  ] in the [MISC U.A.E. Comment  ] ------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Through their deployments in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and their assistance to other countries in the region , [LOC Jordan  ] has shown itself to be a willing and capable partner in support of [LOC U.S.  ] security goals . 
Despite the recent suicide bombing in [LOC Khost  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the resulting press reporting regarding [LOC Jordan  ] 's role in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and domestic public pressures on [LOC Jordan  ] to end its security cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] , the [MISC Jordanians  ] will make significant offers to increase their assistance during the [LOC Washington  ] visit . 
Forefront in their minds , however , is an equally significant reward in the form of economic assistance through an [LOC Afghanistan  ] or other supplemental appropriation . 
Although they would be disappointed not to receive supplemental assistance , the [MISC Jordanians  ] would likely accept reimbursement at cost for any additional contributions we do want , especially if we can identify a third-country donor to assist with [LOC Jordan  ] 's combat pay problem .
