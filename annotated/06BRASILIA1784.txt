End summary . 
BIO-FUELS --------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] explained that formulation of a [LOC U.S.  ] national strategy on bio-fuels is at a relatively early stage , and decisions are now being made on interagency organization and leadership on the issue . 
He said the [ORG USG  ] recognizes already , however , that the bio-fuel technology is transformational , and has strategic implications , especially in development programs in energy-poor third countries . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] will be seeking cooperation in multi-lateral fora , but is now keenly focused on bilateral partnerships , and cooperation with [LOC Brazil  ] is seen as a top [LOC U.S.  ] priority , he said . 
The Ambassador said the [ORG USG  ] is eager to engage with the [ORG GOB  ] on both strategic planning and technical cooperation , and offered future meetings of [LOC U.S.  ] officials with [MISC Brazilian  ] counterparts . 
He said he would be taking [PER Rousseff  ] 's comments with him for policy discussions in [LOC Washington  ] in coming days , and [PER Rousseff  ] and Ambassador agreed that he would brief her upon his return to [LOC Brazil.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Rousseff  ] confirmed the [ORG GOB  ] is extremely interested in cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] , and noted she was present at the [LOC St. Petersburg  ] G-8 bilateral between Presidents [PER Lula  ] and [PER Bush  ] where [PER Lula  ] provided President [PER Bush  ] an information package on bio-fuels . 
[PER Rousseff  ] said that she warmly welcomes high-level engagement with [ORG USG  ] counterparts , noting that she has overall interagency management responsibility for the issue . 
[PER Rousseff  ] said she coordinates work of several [ORG GOB  ] ministries , including Industry , Agriculture , Mines and Energy , Science and [ORG Technology.  ] and [ORG External Relations  ] ; She also chairs the board of [ORG Petrobras  ] , the country 's petroleum sector parastatal. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Rousseff  ] said [LOC Brazil  ] 's strategic vision centers on the premise that bio-fuels are , indeed , transformational , that " we are only in the first generation of a technology that will eventually form a new sector of the economy . 
" She said [MISC Brazilian  ] research , development and policy planning proceeds at present mainly on two axes: one for bio-ethanol , the other for bio-diesel , including [LOC Brazil  ] 's evolving " [MISC H-bio  ] " fuel ( though [LOC Brazil  ] is also investing heavily in [LOC R/D  ] in cellulosic materials , she noted ) . <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In ethanol , [LOC Brazil  ] uses its well-developed industrial base , its wide distribution of ethanol at gas stations , and its rapidly expanding fleet of cars with flex-fuel engines to create a model where market circumstances work to the country 's benefit . 
When ethanol prices rise , [LOC Brazil  ] increases exports and domestic consumers opt for gas . 
When global gas prices go up , [MISC Brazilian  ] consumers fall back on ethanol or blends . 
The [ORG GOB  ] maintains [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001784 002 OF 003 ethanol stocks and regulates a small percentage of production , but mostly relies on natural market dynamics , she added . 
Ambassador asked whether [LOC Brazil  ] can increase its ethanol production to meet expanding export potential . 
[PER Rousseff  ] said ample capacity for new agriculture and successful development by [MISC Brazilian  ] researchers of new sugar cane hybrids that can grow in vast areas of [LOC Brazil  ] previously unsuitable for the crop ( e.g. , plantations in southern [LOC Brazil  ] ) make the [ORG GOB  ] optimistic about increasing its ethanol production dramatically in coming years. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In the area of bio-diesel fuels , [PER Rousseff  ] says [LOC Brazil  ] 's program is only three years old , but already bio-diesel is being offered at 4,000 gas stations nationwide . 
She also sees high potential for use of the technology for social development , both within [LOC Brazil  ] and abroad . 
In [LOC Brazil  ] 's case , small family farms are already important contributors in the process , with [ORG Petrobras  ] and others obligated to buy material that is certified by the [ORG GOB  ] to have a substantial input from small farmers . 
In the case of [MISC Petrobras'  ] developing new [MISC H-bio  ] fuel ( which , unlike bio-diesel mix , is a refined product ) , both industrial and small farm sources will be needed , she added . 
In the area of [MISC H-bio  ] , [PER Rousseff  ] looks for substantial [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] collaboration , in light of the large number of [LOC U.S.  ] refineries suitable for the process , and the advanced capabilities of [LOC U.S.  ] bio-chemical research labs . 
THIRD COUNTRY DEVELOPMENT AND [LOC BOLIVIA  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Focusing further on use of bio-fuels in third country development and poverty alleviation , Ambassador shared with [PER Rousseff  ] a chart showing the extremely high levels of GDP expended on energy by many poor countries . 
[PER Rousseff  ] opined that the [LOC Caribbean  ] and [LOC Central America  ] seem most likely to benefit from ethanol production , at least in the early stage , while bio-diesel technologies could offer the most immediate promise in [LOC Africa  ] and other areas . 
She reiterated that [LOC Brazil  ] shares with the [LOC U.S.  ] the desire to see the new technologies incorporated into development and foreign assistance policies , and wants to work together with the [ORG USG  ] on such projects. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador asked [PER Rousseff  ] specifically about an idea she had discussed in a meeting earlier in the year with [ORG WHA A/S Tom Shannon  ] , in which [PER Rousseff  ] proposed [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] collaboration in offering bio-fuel capacity and guaranteed [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] markets to [LOC Bolivia  ] as a substitution commodity for coca planted in the [LOC Chapare  ] region . 
[PER Rousseff  ] indicated that President [PER Lula  ] has since raised the general possibility of bio-fuel substitution for coca crops directly on two occasions with [MISC Bolivian  ] President [PER Evo Morales  ] , who appeared receptive and requested a specific proposal . 
Ambassador indicated there is interest within the [ORG USG  ] in this concept , and undertook to discuss a way ahead with [LOC Washington  ] agencies and report back to [PER Rousseff  ] . 
COOPERATION IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INVESTMENT --------------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Continuing on the issues of narcotics and crime , Ambassador noted his recent meetings with Justice Minister [PER Bastos  ] and with senior state officials in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] and [LOC Rio  ] , in which [ORG USG  ] assistance in dealing with [LOC Brazil  ] 's organized crime crisis and narcotics problem was warmly welcomed . 
[PER Rousseff  ] concurred emphatically , saying " we need your help now , this cannot wait until after our elections . 
" ( [ORG Note: Brazil  ] has general elections in October . 
End note . 
) Ambassador specifically offered [LOC U.S.  ] information on " lessons learned " in investigation of organized crime groups within the prison system , which [PER Rousseff  ] agreed is of urgent relevance to [LOC Brazil  ] in confronting the [ORG PCC  ] organized crime groups violent attacks in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
[PER Rousseff  ] echoed Justice [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001784 003 OF 003 Minister [PER Bastos'  ] receptivity to visits to [LOC Brazil  ] by the [ORG U.S. Attorney General  ] and [ORG DEA  ] Administrator , and committed to use her office to assure " top-down " momentum for enhanced bilateral strategic cooperation on law enforcement. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In closing , Ambassador underscored his strong interest in bringing increased and socially responsible [LOC U.S.  ] investment to [LOC Brazil  ] , and offered to bring investor groups and the [ORG Council on Competitiveness to Brazil  ] for meetings with [PER Rousseff  ] and [ORG GOB  ] and industry leaders . 
[PER Rousseff  ] said she would enthusiastically work with the Embassy on this , and warmly welcomed the fact that the [LOC United States  ] " has an energetic Ambassador " in [LOC Brasilia.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment . 
This initial meeting between Ambassador and [PER Rousseff  ] was warm , positively-charged and substantively dense . 
We have in [PER Rousseff  ] , we believe , an enthusiastic and highly influential senior [ORG GOB  ] interlocutor on these key issues , and we intend to cultivate our relationship with her . 
If [PER Lula  ] wins re-election , we think it likely she will continue in her current post , and in the event of a [PER Lula  ] victory in October , it would be highly productive to arrange a visit soon thereafter to [LOC Washington  ] for [PER Rousseff  ] for top-level consultations .
