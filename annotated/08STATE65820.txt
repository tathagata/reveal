END SUMMARY . 
[ORG DRC  ] ACTION AGAINST THE [ORG LRA  ] --------------------------- 2 ) ( S ) President [PER Museveni  ] said the [ORG DRC  ] has not actively attempted to end the [ORG LRA  ] threat to the region despite numerous diplomatic agreements and regional meetings . 
[PER Museveni  ] noted that [PER Kabila  ] has agreed on many occasions to remove the [ORG LRA  ] from eastern [ORG DRC  ] , but “nothing happens” after an agreement is reached . 
[PER Museveni  ] said regional [ORG Defense Attaches  ] recently agreed to military action against the [ORG LRA  ] but could not develop a joint plan of action to deploy . 
He also noted that “there was a lack of seriousness” among some of the regional players . 
3 ) ( S ) [PER Museveni  ] did not believe the [ORG Armed Forces of the  ] [ORG DRC  ] ( [ORG FARDC  ] ) had the capacity or the will to carry out a successful mission against the [ORG LRA  ] . 
[PER A/S Frazer  ] told [PER Museveni  ] that [PER Kabila  ] believed in [ORG FARDC  ] , s capabilities , and [MISC Kabila’s  ] continued engagement has shown the [MISC DRC’s  ] will to conduct a successful operation . 
[MISC Kabila’s  ] main fear , [PER A/S Frazer  ] noted , is that [MISC Ugandan  ] [ORG People’s Defense Forces  ] ( [ORG UPDF  ] ) action on [ORG DRC  ] soil would create political problems for [PER Kabila  ] in [LOC Kinshasa  ] . 
[PER Museveni  ] acknowledged [MISC Kabila’s  ] reservations , but noted that [MISC Kabila’s  ] logic “didn’t make sense” since [ORG LRA  ] , not the [ORG UPDF  ] , is killing [MISC Congolese  ] and destabilizing the region . 
4 ) ( C ) [PER A/S Frazer  ] suggested the [ORG UPDF  ] provide technical advisors to the [ORG FARDC  ] , possibly embedding one to two [ORG UPDF  ] soldiers in appropriate [ORG FARDC  ] units . 
[PER Museveni  ] did not believe [PER Kabila  ] would accept technical or logistical assistance from the [ORG UPDF  ] or other regional militaries . 
The Government of [LOC Uganda  ] ( [ORG GOU  ] ) offered the [ORG DRC  ] a [ORG UPDF  ] [MISC C-130  ] aircraft for the proposed [ORG FARDC  ] operation but [PER Kabila  ] rejected it , [PER Museveni  ] said . 
[PER Museveni  ] did not believe technical advisors would be helpful beaaaaacause the [ORG FARDC  ] needed combat personnel , not technical support . 
5 ) ( C ) [PER A/S Frazer  ] said [PER Kabila  ] informed her that he plans to send two [ORG FARDC  ] battalions to deploy against the [ORG LRA  ] by the end of the month . 
[PER Museveni  ] indicated he is open to a joint [MISC UPDF/FARDC  ] operation if [PER Kabila  ] agrees . 
[ORG A/S  ] affirmed that President [PER Bush  ] remains very interested in ending the [ORG LRA  ] threat and would welcome [PER Museveni  ] , s thoughts on the [ORG LRA  ] threat to the region . 
[LOC LIBYA  ] ----- 6 ) ( S ) President [PER Museveni  ] said [MISC Libyan  ] President [PER Qadhafi  ] “is a problem” for the continent and is pushing for the creation of a “United [MISC States of Africa”  ] to be governed by one president . 
[PER Museveni  ] thought Qadhafi’s plan is neither feasible nor desirable , given cultural and linguistic differences across the continent . 
Rather than the development of a unitary [MISC African  ] state , [PER Museveni  ] said he is pushing [PER Qadhafi  ] and other [MISC African  ] leaders to develop regional political federations and markets that support common objectives . 
[PER Museveni  ] indicated to [PER A/S Frazer  ] that [PER Qadhafi  ] continues to “intimidate” small [MISC African  ] countries through bribes and other pressure . 
As a result of Libya’s actions , small [MISC West African  ] countries have been afraid to participate fully or speak out during international meetings at the [ORG United Nations  ] , [ORG African Union  ] , and other forums . 
7 ) ( S ) [PER Museveni  ] noted that tensions with [PER Qadhafi  ] are growing and as a result , and he worries that [PER Qadhafi  ] will attack his plane while flying over international airspace . 
[PER Museveni  ] requested that the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOU  ] coordinate to provide additional air radar information when he flies over international waters . 
[LOC ZIMBABWE  ] -------- 8 ) ( C ) [PER Museveni  ] told [PER A/S Frazer  ] that he spoke to [MISC Zimbabwean  ] President [PER Mugabe  ] by telephone after the first round of elections . 
During his call , [PER Mugabe  ] told [PER Museveni  ] he was confident he would win in the second round of elections . 
[PER Mugabe  ] told [PER Museveni  ] he did not want election monitors from countries that were “hostile” to [LOC Zimbabwe  ] , but wouldn’t mind observers from other countries . 
[PER A/S Frazer  ] thought thousands of monitors were necessary , especially in rural areas , to encourage people to vote . 
[PER A/S Frazer  ] advised [PER Museveni  ] that she would ask the [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador in [LOC Zimbabwe  ] how many elections monitors he believes are needed . 
9 ) ( C ) [PER Museveni  ] thought [MISC Zimbabwe’s  ] faltering economy and Mugabe’s poor understanding of the private sector were at the root of [MISC Zimbabwe’s  ] political problems . 
He said a discussion of the economy would provide an entry point to tell [PER Mugabe  ] that he has failed and is embarrassing liberation leaders . 
He noted that [PER Mugabe  ] is unwilling to take calls from most [MISC African  ] leaders saying they are not his age-mates. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 .
