Reason: 1.4 ( b , d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: In an extended November 24 meeting , [ORG Ministry of External Affairs  ] Joint Secretary for [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and [ORG Iran Affairs  ] Y.K.Sinha lamented that recent media focus on the corruption and inefficiency of [MISC Afghan  ] President [PER Hamid Karzai’s  ] government is “undermining” international community efforts in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Sinha  ] , who is the functional equivalent of an Assistant Secretary and the GOI’s senior point person on [MISC Af-Pak  ] policy , stated that the [ORG GOI  ] avoids “micromanaging” its dealings with [PER Karzai  ] but stresses instead the importance of keeping [MISC Taliban  ] elements and [MISC Islamists  ] out of the government . 
[PER Sinha  ] said the [ORG GOI  ] takes a dim view of [MISC Afghan  ] reconciliation prospects , since true reconciliation can take place only among people -- unlike the [MISC Taliban  ] -- who adhere to the [MISC Afghan  ] constitution and are committed to democratic government . 
[PER Sinha  ] repeatedly stressed the need for greater [MISC USG-GOI  ] coordination and cooperation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] that goes beyond development assistance cooperation . 
Turning to [LOC Pakistan  ] , [PER Sinha  ] called on the [ORG USG  ] to recognize and resist [MISC Islamabad’s  ] “game” of promising cooperation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] in return for [ORG USG  ] pressure on [LOC India  ] to improve ties with [LOC Pakistan  ] , while also exaggerating India’s threat to [LOC Pakistan  ] and “trying to internationalize every bilateral issue between [LOC India  ] and [ORG Pakistan.” He  ] stated that [LOC India  ] has “no benchmarks” for resumption of the “paused” [ORG Composite Dialogue  ] with [LOC Pakistan  ] , and he delivered a bleak long-term prognosis for bilateral relations: “call me a cynic , but even if [LOC India  ] were to lop off [LOC Kashmir  ] and hand it on a platter to [LOC Pakistan  ] , they would still find a reason to make trouble for us.” End Summary . 
Afghanistan: “Micromanagement” No , [MISC Anti-Taliban Yes  ] --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Drawing from reftel points , A/DCM summarized [ORG USG  ] priorities in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and emphasized the need for the [PER Karzai  ] administration to make merit-based governmental appointments and take firm steps to end the perception of a culture of impunity . 
[PER Sinha  ] stated that the [ORG GOI  ] does not discuss corruption-related issues with [PER Karzai  ] , since [LOC India  ] wants to avoid “micromanaging” the [MISC Afghan  ] government . 
He lamented recent media focus on corruption in [PER Karzai’s  ] government , stating that such coverage “undermines” international community efforts in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Sinha  ] paraphrased a statement he attributed to Prime Minister [PER Singh  ] to the effect that negative media attention focus on corruption detracts completely from good-news stories about tangible progress in education and other areas. “When you undermine [PER Karzai  ] , ” [PER Sinha  ] warned , “you undermine your own efforts.” He said that he believes that [PER Karzai  ] “has gotten the message” about international community frustration with his government’s corruption and inefficiency and “realizes he must do better.” He said he observed the Secretary’s interaction with [PER Karzai  ] at his inauguration in [LOC Kabul  ] , and believes that their “excellent personal rapport” will assist international community dealings with the [MISC Afghan  ] government. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In [ORG GOI  ] dealings with [PER Karzai  ] , [PER Sinha  ] said the [MISC Indians  ] stress the importance of keeping [MISC Taliban  ] elements out of the government . 
He stated that the [ORG GOI  ] works closely with the [MISC Afghan  ] government when identifying projects to disburse the GOI’s claimed USD 1.3 billion assistance to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
As a result of this and India’s historical links to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC India  ] remains popular among the [MISC Afghan  ] people ( as evidence , he claimed that a recent [MISC Gallup  ] poll found that 56 percent of [MISC Afghans  ] favored an [MISC Indian  ] presence in [LOC Afghanistan  ] while 33 percent believed that [LOC Pakistan  ] supports the [MISC Taliban  ] ) . 
He stated that a recent delivery of 3 tons of [MISC Afghan  ] apples to [LOC India  ] via air freight demonstrates the scope for increased economic ties between [LOC India  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
When asked about [ORG GOI  ] views on [MISC Afghan  ] reconciliation efforts , [PER Sinha  ] said the [MISC Indians  ] believe that true reconciliation can only take place among people who adhere to the [MISC Afghan  ] constitution and are committed to democratic government . 
He does not believe that most [MISC Taliban  ] and [MISC Islamists  ] adhere to the constitution or are committed to democracy in [LOC Afghanistan  ] .

( C ) [PER Sinha  ] repeatedly stressed the need for greater [MISC USG-GOI  ] coordination and cooperation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] that goes beyond development assistance cooperation . 
He stated that [LOC India  ] has ability and interest in expanding military and police training for [MISC Afghans  ] in [LOC India  ] . 
[PER Sinha  ] was pleased to learn of discussions about placing an [MISC Indian  ] military liaison officer at [LOC CENTCOM  ] headquarters. “We understand the sensitivities involved , but we can help.” [ORG Pakistan: Don’t Go For The Head Fake  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) While Sinha’s remarks about [LOC Afghanistan  ] were largely upbeat , the tone and substance of his comments regarding [LOC Pakistan  ] were relentlessly negative . 
He called on the [ORG USG  ] to see through and resist [ORG Pakistan’s  ] “game” of promising cooperation in [LOC Afghanistan  ] in return for “U.S. pressure on [LOC India  ] to sort out [ORG Pakistan’s  ] problems with [PER India.” Sinha  ] accused [LOC Pakistan  ] of falsely claiming that [LOC India  ] poses a grave threat on [ORG Pakistan’s  ] eastern border: “if they really believed that , ” he intoned , “they never would have withdrawn an entire army corps from the east and deployed it in the west.” He also claimed that an essential element of [MISC Pakistani  ] policy is to “try to internationalize every bilateral issue between us.” To illustrate his point , he cited [MISC Pakistani  ] claims that [LOC India  ] is unjustly diverting water from [LOC Pakistan  ] , accusations that he said were shown to be false by [ORG Pakistan’s  ] recent bumper harvest in [LOC Punjab  ] . 
In fact , [PER Sinha  ] claimed , water cooperation is the “one area of the bilateral relationship that actually works” due to the effectiveness of the [ORG Indus Waters Treaty  ] of 1960 . 
He confirmed that biannual meetings of the [ORG Indus Water Commission  ] continue , with an [MISC Indian  ] delegation expected to visit [LOC Pakistan  ] before year-end . 
[PER Sinha  ] said [LOC Pakistan  ] has been unable to show evidence to back its assertion that [LOC India  ] is providing arms to anti-government fighters in [LOC Waziristan.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Repeating the standard [ORG GOI  ] mantra , [PER Sinha  ] stated that the “Composite Dialogue” with [LOC Pakistan  ] is “paused” and will not resume until [LOC Pakistan  ] takes “credible and verifiable” measures against terror directed at [LOC India.  ] “We have no benchmarks” for resumption , [PER Sinha  ] stated , adding that improvement in bilateral ties is not dependent on a single measure such as [MISC Pakistani  ] action against [PER Lashkar-e-Taiba  ] ( LeT ) supremo [PER Hafez Saeed  ] . 
[PER Sinha  ] stated he is “convinced that LeT is a creature of the ISI and armed by the [ORG ISI.” He  ] recounted that [MISC Indian  ] Foreign Minister [PER Krishna  ] asked [MISC Pakistani  ] FM [PER Qureshi  ] during an impromptu encounter at [LOC Karzai’s  ] inauguration lunch about constant delays and adjournments in the trial of alleged [LOC Mumbai  ] attack conspirators . 
[PER Qureshi  ] replied that the [MISC Pakistani  ] government can not interfere in [ORG Pakistan’s  ] judicial process . 
[PER Sinha  ] cited this reply as proof that [LOC Pakistan  ] is not serious about bringing [LOC Mumbai  ] conspirators to justice “because the [MISC Pakistanis  ] constantly interfere in the judicial process when it suits them to do so.” He delivered a bleak long-term prognosis for [MISC India-Pakistan  ] relations. “Call me a cynic , ” [PER Sinha  ] sighed , “but even if [LOC India  ] were to lop off [LOC Kashmir  ] and hand it on a platter to [LOC Pakistan  ] , they would still find a reason to make trouble for us.” ROEMER</pre></code>
