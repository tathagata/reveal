( C ) Summary: Ambassador , DATT and ODC Chief met with [MISC Dutch  ] CHOD Gen. [PER Dick Berlijn  ] on July 19 . 
Gen. [PER Berlijn  ] reviewed [MISC Dutch  ] thinking on participation in [ORG ISAF III  ] , including a [ORG PRT  ] consisting initially of 1000 personnel ( later to be expanded to 1200 ) deployed most likely to [LOC Uruzgan  ] province . 
Later discussions on July 26 with the Acting Director of Operations at the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MFA  ] confirmed this preliminary plan . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] will host the [MISC Canadians  ] and [MISC British  ] on August 17-18 to follow-up on the force generation conference . 
[PER Berlijn  ] noted that a compromise in [ORG Parliament  ] prevented plans for an 1800-man deployment , as the main opposition party wanted personnel available for a potential [MISC African  ] mission . 
[PER Berlijn  ] also talked about the possibility of [LOC U.S.  ] support -- either through proximity to [MISC Dutch  ] forces or embedded [LOC U.S.  ] intelligence personnel -- as potentially helping convince [MISC Dutch  ] Minister of Defense [PER Henk Kamp  ] and others in the [MISC Dutch  ] government to deploy to [LOC Uruzgan.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Cont . 
Summary: Gen. [PER Berlijn  ] reviewed changes occurring in the [ORG Dutch Navy  ] . 
Quoting Minister [PER Kamp  ] , [PER Berlijn  ] described the [ORG Dutch Navy  ] as " " demoralized and adrift " " . 
[PER Berlijn  ] explained that they need to become expeditionary , relying less on their frigates and more on coastal patrol vessels and landing platform ships to support land battles . 
He outlined the possibility of selling six " " M " " frigates -- two to [LOC Belgium  ] and four to [LOC Chile  ] -- proceeds from which could potentially be used to purchase coastal patrol vessels , landing platform dock ships , Tactical Tomahawk , helicopters , and other assets. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Cont . 
Summary: [PER Berlijn  ] also stated that he was interested in finding a way to prioritize the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) program within the [MISC Dutch  ] government . 
He hoped to develop a plan to pursue the purchase of an initial , " " acceptably safe " " number of 50-60 JSFs in 2006 , in order to " " depoliticize " " the issue prior to the May 2007 elections . 
By depoliticizing the issue through this initial purchase , [PER Berlijn  ] suggested that the [MISC Dutch  ] could keep options open regarding the total eventual purchase of 80 or more JSFs . 
End Summary. -------------- [ORG ISAF Stage III  ] -------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Gen. [PER Berlijn  ] initially briefed on [MISC Dutch  ] plans to participate in [ORG ISAF Stage III  ] . 
These plans are still by and large under discussion within the [MISC Dutch  ] government ; [MISC Dutch  ] FM Bot has been negotiating with [ORG Parliament  ] over [MISC ISAF III  ] for several weeks . 
[PER MajGen Cobelens  ] , MOD Director of Operations , drafted the preliminary plan presented to [ORG NATO  ] during the July 25 force generation conference . 
According to the Acting Director of Operations at the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MFA  ] on July 26 , this preliminary plan calls for [MISC Dutch  ] partnership with the [MISC Canadians  ] and [MISC Brits  ] at the [ORG Forward Support Base  ] ( [ORG FSB  ] ) in [LOC Kandahar  ] beginning in April 2006 . 
The deployment will last for eighteen months ; command responsibility for the [ORG FSB  ] will be on a six-month rotation with the [MISC Canadians  ] taking the first watch . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] will assume command of the [ORG FSB  ] in November 2006. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) According to the Acting Director of Operations at the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MFA  ] , the preliminary [MISC Dutch  ] plan proposed a [MISC Dutch  ] Provincial [ORG Reconstruction Team  ] ( [ORG PRT  ] ) in [LOC Uruzgan  ] province . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] plan to initially deploy 1000 personnel , ramping up to 1200 personnel by the time they assume charge of the [LOC Kandahar  ] [ORG FSB  ] in November 2006 . 
The 1200-person deployment will also include approximately 4 Chinooks , 4-6 Apaches , and the 4 [MISC F-16s  ] currently stationed in [LOC Kabul  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] MOD will host [LOC Canada  ] and the [LOC UK  ] on August 17-18 to follow-up on [ORG ISAF Stage III  ] proposal details . 
( Note: A read-out from [LOC USNATO  ] suggests that the [LOC United States  ] may be invited to attend the meeting as well ; according to the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MFA  ] , only the [MISC Brits  ] and [MISC Canadians  ] have thus far been invited . 
Post will seek more information on possible [LOC U.S.  ] attendance . 
End note . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Gen. [PER Berlijn  ] explained that he was limited to a [ORG PRT  ] consisting of 1000 personnel due to restrictions set by [ORG Parliament  ] . 
[PER Berlijn  ] initially wanted 1800 personnel , but the [ORG Labor Party  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) demanded that some personnel also be available for possible operations in [LOC Africa  ] ( [ORG NFI  ] ) . 
A compromise within [ORG Parliament  ] led to the 1000-person restriction to accommodate the [ORG Labor Party  ] . 
( Note: [MISC Dutch  ] governments prefer to make military deployment decisions backed by a parliamentary super-majority , usually to include the main opposition party . 
End note . 
) While the number of personnel in the [ORG PRT  ] will eventually increase to 1200 , the Acting Director of Operations at the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MFA  ] explained that this number is a " " maximum " " number set by [ORG Parliament  ] that cannot be exceeded , and will also include air technicians and support for their deployed helicopters and [MISC F-16s  ] . 
Actually , the [MISC Dutch  ] initial plan calls for a fully operational [ORG PRT  ] of 1568 men ; due to the 1200 restriction set by [ORG Parliament  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] were actively encouraging the [MISC Australians  ] to partner with them in the [LOC PRT.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) According to [PER Berlijn  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] had not yet agreed internally ( as of July 19 ) on the location of the [ORG PRT  ] . 
While the [MISC Dutch  ] preliminary plan proposed during the force generation conference calls for a [ORG PRT  ] deployment in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , the subject is still open for debate . 
[PER Berlijn  ] and other members of the military staff were strongly recommending that the [MISC Dutch  ] troops be deployed to [LOC Uruzgan  ] province in central [LOC Afghanistan  ] , where they could , in his view , make a real difference in a challenging environment . 
Others in the government , however , wanted the [MISC Dutch  ] to deploy to the safer province of [LOC Nimruz  ] near the [MISC Iranian  ] border . 
[PER Berlijn  ] discussed the possibility of [LOC U.S.  ] support -- either through proximity to [MISC Dutch  ] forces or embedding [LOC U.S.  ] intelligence within [MISC Dutch  ] forces -- as potentially helping convince his minister and others in the [MISC Dutch  ] government that they can and should deploy to [LOC Uruzgan.  ] -------------------- Future of [ORG Dutch Navy  ] -------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Following a question on the status of potential Tactical Tomahawk acquisition , Gen. [PER Berlijn  ] provided an extended background explanation on changes occurring in the [ORG Dutch Navy  ] . 
According to [PER Berlijn  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] Minister of Defense [PER Kamp  ] recently described the [ORG Dutch Navy  ] as " " demoralized and adrift " " . 
[PER Kamp  ] felt that the [ORG Navy  ] relied too heavily upon their frigates . 
The [ORG Navy  ] needed to reorient and " " focus on tasks " " , becoming " " expeditionary and more coastal " " . <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) After studying the issue , [PER Berlijn  ] stated that the [MISC Dutch  ] need to sell some of their frigates and buy more coastal patrol vessels ( [MISC CPVs  ] ) and landing platform dock ( [ORG LPD  ] ) ships . 
[PER Berlijn  ] cautioned that convincing [MISC Dutch  ] admirals to sell their frigates would be very difficult -- " " Getting the Admirals to give up their frigates is like getting a fighter pilot to give up his fighter " " ( Note: [PER Berlijn  ] is a fighter pilot . 
) . 
[PER Berlijn  ] stated that he wants the [ORG Navy  ] to support land battle and theater ballistic missile defense ( TBMD ) . 
He expressed firm support for a [MISC Dutch  ] submarine capability , noting that " " the [MISC Dutch  ] are in the submarine business " " . 
In that respect , he needed to put an end to the current debate on submarines within the [MISC Dutch  ] government . 
[PER Berlijn  ] also noted that they are looking at a study to improve its oiler ship , including its capacity to incorporate more helicopters in order to support [MISC Dutch  ] troops in the field or for use during amphibious deployments. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Berlijn  ] then discussed the possibility of selling six " " M " " frigates , which he described as " " very sensitive " " as the [MISC Dutch  ] are in competition with the [MISC Brits  ] in this regard . 
He stated that the [MISC Belgians  ] are interested in purchasing two frigates ; the [MISC Chileans  ] have expressed interest in buying the other four . 
( Note: In a conversation with [MISC Dutch  ] FM Bot on July 21 , Bot told ambassador that he was not in favor of selling the frigates , but would not/not disagree with [PER Kamp  ] in Cabinet . 
Bot noted , however , that there was resistance in the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG Navy  ] regarding the sale of the frigates . 
End note . 
) [PER Berlijn  ] further explained that if the [MISC Dutch  ] sold these frigates , proceeds could potentially be used to purchase coastal patrol vessels , landing platform dock ships , Tactical Tomahawk , helicopters , and other assets. -------------------- [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] -------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Berlijn  ] then turned discussion to the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) , and noted that he was looking for ways to prioritize [ORG JSF  ] in the [MISC Dutch  ] government . 
He wished to " " depoliticize " " the issue prior to the May 2007 elections by working to get a commitment from the [MISC Dutch  ] government in 2006 for the purchase of an initial , " " acceptably safe " " number of 50-60 JSFs . 
By depoliticizing the issue with this initial purchase , he suggested that options remained open to eventually buy over 80 JSFs in total . 
He commented that " " even the leftists agree that this is the best fighter we could acquire " " . 
[PER Berlijn  ] acknowledged that if the [MISC Dutch  ] want to keep their aerospace industry alive , they must be actively involved with both [ORG JSF  ] and the [MISC Airbus 380.  ] ------------------------------- Tactical Tomahawks ; [ORG UAV Project  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Berlijn  ] noted that the [MISC Dutch  ] are still committed to the acquisition of Tactical Tomahawks , but it needed to occur sequentially following the development and construction of coastal patrol vessels . 
( Note: Selling the six " " M " " frigates and replacing them with newly-built corvettes -- thus providing work for the [MISC Dutch  ] ship-building industry -- may yield sufficient parliamentary support for acquisition of Tactical Tomahawk , which could be employed on the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG Navy  ] 's new Aegis-equivalent LCF frigates . 
End note . 
) [PER Berlijn  ] briefly addressed the [MISC Dutch  ] unmanned aerial vehicle ( [ORG UAV  ] ) project in partnership with the [MISC French  ] . 
According the [PER Berlijn  ] , the partnership helps diffuse tensions within the [MISC Dutch  ] government regarding the perception that the [MISC Dutch  ] only buy military equipment from the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Berlijn  ] explained , however , that the program has stalled as the [MISC French  ] have taken a " " 90 degree turn " " . 
The [MISC French  ] Defense Minister is scheduled to visit the [LOC Netherlands  ] in September ; the [ORG UAV  ] project will be on the agenda for discussion .
