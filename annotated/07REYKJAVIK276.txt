( [ORG SBU  ] ) On September 20 , Post reiterated to the [ORG Icelandic Ministry for Foreign Affairs  ] the importance the [ORG USG  ] places on [PER Felice Gaer  ] 's election to the [ORG UN Committee  ] Against Torture ( Ref C ) . 
MFA Minister-Counsellor for [ORG International Organization Affairs  ] [PER Nikulas Hannigan  ] repeated the position reported Ref B that [LOC Iceland  ] favors [PER Gaer  ] 's candidacy but has not yet taken a final decision. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: In response to Ref C questions , Post notes that [LOC Iceland  ] has a consistent pattern in recent years of supporting [LOC U.S.  ] candidates for [ORG UN  ] human rights-related bodies . 
Post believes [LOC Iceland  ] will vote for [PER Gaer  ] in this case and that a senior-level phone call will not be necessary to secure this support . 
Engagement on the margins of [MISC UNGA  ] with Foreign Minister [PER Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir  ] ( who will be attending the Secretary 's [MISC Transatlantic Dinner  ] on September 26 as well as the [ORG Women Leaders' Working Group Breakfast  ] on September 28 ) or Permanent Secretary of State [PER Gretar Mar Sigurdsson  ] would not be counter-productive , however .
