[ORG MADRID  ] 162 [ORG MADRID  ] 00000186 001.2 OF 003 Classified By: [ORG DCM  ] [PER Hugo Llorens  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: FM Moratinos' Chief of Staff [PER Javier Sancho  ] told [ORG DCM  ] February 20 that it was politically impossible for [LOC Spain  ] to support the [ORG Kosovar  ] [ORG UDI  ] at this time , and that this is the position of both the ruling [ORG PSOE  ] government and the opposition [MISC Partido Popular  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) . 
[PER Sancho  ] said the [MISC Spanish  ] have tried to be as constructive as possible in [LOC Brussels  ] and have stuck to the position they have consistently elaborated with high-level [ORG USG  ] officials in [LOC Washington  ] and [ORG Madrid: UNSCR  ] 1244 does not provide for a unilateral declaration of independence by [LOC Kosovo  ] ; therefore , [LOC Spain  ] wants a new [ORG UNSCR  ] or a negotiated settlement between the parties . 
Nevertheless , [PER Sancho  ] said , [LOC Spain  ] did not try to oppose an [ORG EU  ] statement on [LOC Kosovo  ] in [LOC Brussels  ] , instead crafting a consensus text that focuses on the [ORG EU  ] 's commitment to the [LOC Balkans  ] while leaving the issue of recognition to the individual member states . 
The [ORG GOS  ] will continue to support [ORG KFOR  ] , [ORG EULEX  ] , and the [ORG OSCE  ] presence in [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
[PER Sancho  ] said this is the final [ORG GOS  ] position on [LOC Kosovo  ] until after the elections . 
If [PER Zapatero  ] wins reelection , the [ORG GOS  ] will be willing to discuss further avenues for progress toward peace and stability in the [LOC Balkans  ] and to work constructively with the [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] will have lunch with Deputy FM Bernardino [PER Leon February  ] 21 and will press [PER Leon  ] on how [LOC Spain  ] can move forward in the [LOC Balkans  ] after the elections . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [ORG DCM  ] delivered ref A demarche to [PER Javier Sancho  ] , Chief of Staff to Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] . 
[PER Moratinos  ] , who is running for Parliament representing [LOC Cordoba  ] , was unavailable from the campaign trail in [LOC Andalucia  ] as he was under the weather. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Sancho  ] told the [ORG DCM  ] that it was politically impossible for the [ORG GOS  ] to support [LOC Kosovo  ] 's unilateral declaration of independence in the middle of a hotly contested campaign , and to have expected otherwise was not realistic . 
[PER Sancho  ] noted that both the ruling [ORG PSOE  ] government and the opposition [ORG PP  ] opposed the [ORG UDI  ] and had said so publicly numerous times in the months leading to February 17 . 
[PER Sancho  ] said that the [ORG GOS  ] had maintained this position consistently both in [LOC Brussels  ] and with high-level [ORG USG  ] officials , but had tried to be as constructive as possible in supporting an [ORG EU  ] consensus . 
[PER Sancho  ] noted that [PER Moratinos  ] had led the [ORG GAERC  ] in producing a consensus conclusion on [LOC Kosovo  ] that did not discuss recognition , when he could have proposed a text opposing the [MISC UDI.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Sancho  ] told the [ORG DCM  ] that there would be no more public statements from the MFA on their [LOC Kosovo  ] position prior to the elections , adding that the [ORG GOS  ] wants it out of the headlines . 
If [PER Zapatero  ] wins reelection March 9 , [PER Sancho  ] said the [ORG GOS  ] would be open to further discussions on working with the [LOC U.S.  ] and toward [ORG EU  ] consensus for peace and stability in the [LOC Balkans.  ] //MORATINOS PRESS COMMENTS// <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Major international and [MISC Spanish  ] media seized on Moratinos' comments in [LOC Brussels  ] prior to entering the February 18 [ORG GAERC  ] , in which he said , " The [MISC Spanish  ] government will not recognize the unilateral act proclaimed yesterday by the [ORG Kosovar  ] assembly , and it will not recognize it because we do not believe it respects international legality.. . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] government has always defended respect for international legality . 
It defended it when it decided to withdraw troops from [LOC Iraq  ] , and it defends it again now when talking about the secession of a state.. . 
If you examine the nations who are against this recognition , they are the countries that know best and are the most similar to the [LOC West Balkans  ] . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Moratinos  ] went on to say that [ORG Kosovar  ] independence would be legal if brought about by a new [ORG UNSCR  ] or by a negotiated agreement between the parties , and that [LOC Spain  ] wished to uphold the international principle of territorial integrity . 
He also said [LOC Spain  ] would continue to support stability and security for the [LOC Balkans  ] . 
The [ORG GOS  ] has stated that it will maintain its presence in [ORG KFOR  ] and its support for [ORG EULEX  ] and the [ORG OSCE  ] mission in [LOC Kosovo.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Asked by reporters February 19 whether [LOC Spain  ] 's elections impacted its policy on [LOC Kosovo  ] , [PER Moratinos  ] denied this and said , " Yesterday we made a proposal to guarantee a minimum of unity among [ORG EU  ] partners , and above all , to support and monitor stability and security in the region , which is [ORG MADRID  ] 00000186 002.2 OF 003 part of [LOC Europe  ] and which we are interested in preserving and guaranteeing . 
" //SPANISH ELECTORAL ENVIRONMENT// <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) As both the [ORG GOS  ] and the [ORG PP  ] predicted privately to post , [LOC Kosovo  ] 's independence has prompted numerous provocative statements by nationalist parties in the [LOC Basque Country  ] and [LOC Catalonia  ] . 
[MISC Catalan  ] Left ( [ORG ERC  ] ) spokesman [PER Joan Ridao  ] said February 18 that [LOC Kosovo  ] was " a very important precedent " for [LOC Catalonia  ] and the [LOC Basque Country  ] , adding that " when the people want independence , it must be accepted.. . 
Any country or nation under the scope of the [ORG EU  ] in the 21st century can achieve its independence if it is democratically decided... no one can avoid this . 
" In a blog entry entitled , " [LOC Spain  ] does not have the balls to send tanks against us , " [ORG ERC  ] Parliamentarian [PER Joan Puig  ] wrote that [LOC Kosovo  ] was " another proof that our nation will be independent if a political and social majority decides it . 
[LOC Spain  ] understands this very clearly , which is why it has reacted in this way . 
" [PER Josep Carod-Rovira  ] , vice president of the [MISC Catalan  ] Generalitat and renowned [PER Catalanista  ] , called on the [ORG GOS  ] to recognize [LOC Kosovo  ] as soon as possible on January 18 , as did [PER Artur Mas  ] , the president of [MISC Catalan  ] centrist party [ORG Convergence and Union  ] ( [ORG CiU  ] ) . 
On February 20 , representatives from [ORG CiU  ] and [ORG ERC  ] announced they would travel to [LOC Kosovo  ] to " study the secession process . 
" <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Basque Nationalist Party  ] ( [ORG PNV  ] ) spokeswoman [PER Miren Azkarate  ] said [LOC Kosovo  ] 's independence was " a lesson in how to resolve conflicts of identity and belonging in a peaceful , democratic manner... the will of the people is the key to resolving entrenched political problems.. . 
[LOC Kosovo  ] is a new example of the vigor of the democratic right to self determination enshrined in international law , and it betrays once more those who maintain that this right does not exist in democratic nations . 
" <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) By contrast , the [ORG PP  ] has maintained staunch unity in its position against [LOC Kosovo  ] 's independence . 
[ORG PP  ] founder and elder statesman [PER Manuel Fraga  ] said February 19 that [LOC Spain  ] must not support [LOC Kosovo  ] because one could " draw the same conclusions about [LOC Spain  ] in ( the [MISC Basque  ] town of ) [ORG Galdakano  ] or in a [MISC Catalan  ] town . 
[LOC Spain  ] cannot accept that any group whatsoever can declare itself independent with all the complications this has implied " in the [LOC Balkans  ] . 
[PER Fraga  ] also called on the [ORG GOS  ] to withdraw its forces from [LOC KFOR.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG PP  ] President and presidential candidate [PER Mariano Rajoy  ] said February 18 that [LOC Spain  ] " should not send or maintain the presence of civilian officials " in [LOC Kosovo  ] after its [ORG UDI  ] , which he said was " contrary to international legality . 
" Speaking on a conservative news program , [PER Rajoy  ] said , " If there is no agreement between the parties and no new resolution from the [ORG UN Security Council  ] , this is against international legality , such that I believe [LOC Spain  ] should not recognize [LOC Kosovo  ] as an independent state . 
" [PER Rajoy  ] went on to add that the situation had nothing to do with nationalist movements in [LOC Spain  ] . 
He said , " [LOC Spain  ] is the oldest nation in [LOC Europe  ] with more than 500 years of history.. . 
In [LOC Kosovo  ] there is a military and religious conflict , and here there is absolutely nothing of the sort . 
" The next day , February 19 , [PER Rajoy  ] took it one step further , calling on President [PER Zapatero  ] and [PER Moratinos  ] to explain the " incongruity " of opposing [LOC Kosovo  ] 's independence yet maintaining support for international missions to [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
He added that he would have preferred " that [MISC Spanish  ] diplomats had better managed this fight . 
" <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Gustavo de Aristegui  ] , [ORG PP  ] foreign affairs expert and ranking member of the [MISC Spanish  ] Foreign Affairs Commission , wrote February 18 in [ORG EL MUNDO  ] that , " the unilateral declaration of independence is unacceptable , illegal and a defiance to the peace and stability of all of [LOC Europe  ] . 
" //MAINSTREAM EDITORIAL PRESS// <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The tone across the entire political spectrum of [MISC Spanish  ] press expressed concern for the potential ramifications in [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Europe  ] . 
An [ORG ABC  ] editorial declared , " [LOC Kosovo  ] is going to be an economic and political burden for the [ORG European Union  ] , but a sweet gift for the [LOC U.S.  ] , which will have a new ally and a gigantic military base in the only majority-Muslim country in the world where [LOC U.S.  ] flags are sold in kiosks . 
" A February 18 editorial in liberal [ORG EL Publico  ] stated , " The negotiations of the [MISC Spanish  ] foreign ministry and of [ORG Aznar  ] failed in [LOC Washington  ] . 
The attempts to convince the [LOC U.S.  ] of the danger that independence implies did not convince . 
" [PER Pilar Bonet  ] wrote in the [MISC Catalan  ] paper [LOC LA  ] VANGUARDIA February 18 , " [LOC Kosovo  ] 's independence opens [ORG MADRID  ] 00000186 003.2 OF 003 up a [PER Pandora  ] 's box and reopens healed wounds in the territorial configuration of the successor states to the [LOC Soviet Union  ] . 
" [PER Andres Ortega  ] wrote in [ORG EL PAIS  ] February 18 , " More than a declaration of independence it seems like a declaration of dependence . 
[LOC Kosovo  ] does not appear to be a prepared or viable country . 
" A February 20 op-ed in conservative [ORG La Razon  ] stated , " [LOC Europe  ] has set a very dangerous precedent , one that will affect the territorial integrity of some nations that have supported the process . 
" [ORG EL PAIS  ] published a February 20 op-ed stating , " [LOC Kosovo  ] is today an 'Ulster' in its potential for nuclear combustion in the [LOC Balkans  ] and beyond . 
" [PER Julia Navarro  ] wrote in a February 19 op-ed for wire service [ORG Europa Press  ] , " In [LOC Spain  ] we can already start soaking our beards ; [LOC Kosovo  ] 's independence will have consequences on our country , more so now that all the politicians have said you cannot compare one situation with the other . 
We all know you can , and that it is simply a question of a few soulless rulers in the [LOC United States  ] and the [ORG European Union  ] deciding one day that in [LOC Spain  ] there are other Kosovos . 
" //WELL , SO WHAT ? // <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) If the leftist and nationalist parties are happy about [LOC Kosovo  ] 's independence , if the [ORG PSOE  ] government needs the leftist and nationalist parties to form a coalition government after the elections , and if all mainstream parties agree that [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Kosovo  ] are not the same , then what is the [ORG PSOE  ] government so worried about ? 
The answer lies in the [ORG PSOE  ] 's need to assure the centrist , mainstream [MISC Spanish  ] voter that all of the [ORG PP  ] 's accusations about [PER Zapatero  ] " Balkanizing " [LOC Spain  ] and " presiding over the dissolution of the 500 year old [MISC Spanish  ] kingdom " are groundless . 
By recognizing [LOC Kosovo  ] prior to the elections , the [ORG GOS  ] would have opened itself up to renewed attacks from the right about pandering to nationalist minorities , when in fact the [ORG PSOE  ] gains nothing electoral by joining nationalist minorities on [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
These minority parties will have no choice but to join with the [ORG PSOE  ] after the election if they hope to govern . 
The nationalist parties are understandably pumping up the issue to increase their turnout , but they too understand the state of play. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) The [ORG PSOE  ] 's biggest fear is not criticism from the left but abstention from the center . 
Low turnout by distraught left-leaning centrists combined with the strong mobilization of the " king and country " [ORG PP  ] base would put a [ORG PSOE  ] victory at risk . 
In this sense , the [ORG PP  ] has left no wiggle room whatsoever by laying out clear markers , including by former President [ORG Aznar  ] , that the [ORG PSOE  ] would not be able to slide by on [ORG EU  ] consensus on [LOC Kosovo  ] . 
Speculation about how [LOC Kosovo  ] might have fared under the [ORG PP  ] is somewhat pointless , but all indications are that a [PER Rajoy  ] government would have been no more amenable to a [ORG UDI  ] had the matter been pushed until after the elections . 
In any case , the [ORG PP  ] can now argue that [LOC Kosovo  ] 's independence is bad for [LOC Spain  ] and that the [PER Zapatero  ] government was too weak internationally to prevent it. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) For its part , the [ORG GOS  ] is caught in a logical trap - how to reconcile their continuing military and civilian presence in [LOC Kosovo  ] with their refusal to recognize [LOC Kosovo  ] 's right to independence . 
As statements by nationalist politicians and editorials by mainstream [MISC Spaniards  ] show , this issue is not completely foreign to [MISC Spanish  ] politics , and the average [MISC Spaniard  ] does not want [LOC Kosovo  ] to imply a precedent for the [ORG Basque Country  ] and [ORG Catalonia  ] . 
Their best option , and the one which they are following , is to keep [PER Zapatero  ] out of it , get the issue out of the headlines , and move on . 
[PER Moratinos  ] , Defense Minister [PER Alonso  ] , and former Defense Minister [PER Pepe Bono  ] have done the heavy lifting . 
[PER Moratinos  ] even earned rare praise from [MISC French  ] FM [ORG Kouchner  ] who said " the [MISC Spaniards  ] were intelligent and generous " in their maneuvering at the [LOC GAERC.  ] //NEXT MOVES// <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) The [ORG PSOE  ] caught a break with the February 19 announcement of [PER Fidel Castro  ] 's resignation , which takes [LOC Kosovo  ] off the front page in [LOC Spain  ] and also allows [PER Zapatero  ] and the [ORG GOS  ] to engage the rhetorical machine on how [LOC Spain  ] must help [LOC Cuba  ] toward democracy . 
Additionally , their policy of engagement , while obviously not a driving force in [PER Castro  ] 's resignation , enhances [ORG GOS  ] credibility with the pro-Cuban [MISC Spanish  ] populace , as well as with the pro-Castro far-left. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Aguirre  ] will have lunch with Deputy FM Bernardino [PER Leon February  ] 21 and will press [PER Leon  ] on how [LOC Spain  ] can move forward in the [LOC Balkans  ] after the elections .
