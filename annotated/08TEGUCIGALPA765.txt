( C ) Summary: Local press continues to spin about the [MISC Honduran  ] government 's impending signature to [PER Hugo Chavez  ] 's [ORG Bolivarian Alternative  ] for the [ORG Americas  ] ( [ORG ALBA  ] ) , currently scheduled to take place with much fanfare on August 25 . 
The private sector has publicly announced its opposition to the agreement and lamented its harmful effects on the investment climate to Embassy officials , but has shown scant leadership to stop it . 
Constitutionally required Congressional approval is needed to adopt [ORG ALBA  ] , which , in turn , requires the support of President of [ORG Congress  ] [PER Roberto Micheletti  ] , who has been suffering from low polling numbers and has been desperately looking for allies to support his presidential bid . 
After reportedly reaching an agreement with [PER Zelaya  ] to support [ORG ALBA  ] , [PER Micheletti  ] may have backed off , and is reportedly now asking individual members of [ORG Congress  ] to take on [ORG ALBA  ] without him , privately declaring his own political capital with the Presidential palace spent . 
The outcome may depend on what is more important to [PER Micheletti  ] - his anti-communist sentiments or his desire to repair his relationship with [PER Zelaya  ] , improving his chances of being the next [ORG Liberal  ] candidate for the Presidency . 
End Summary . 
[ORG Private Sector Publicly Opposes ALBA  ] , But [MISC Lacks Action  ] --------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Emboffs  ] met with private sector representatives August 14 , including President of the [ORG National Council for Private Enterprise  ] ( [ORG COHEP  ] ) , [PER Amilcar Bulnes  ] , Acting President of the [ORG Tegucigalpa Chamber of Commerce  ] , [PER Carlos Bueso  ] , and President of the [ORG Private Banking Association  ] ( [ORG AHIBA  ] ) , [PER Roque Rivera  ] . 
These representatives had publicly announced their opposition to [ORG ALBA  ] the day after a meeting with President [PER Zelaya  ] . 
These private sector representatives told [ORG Emboffs  ] that membership in [ORG ALBA  ] would define [LOC Honduras  ] as a " communist " country , and said it would give the [ORG GOH  ] impetus to nationalize private enterprises on a mass scale . 
[PER Rivera  ] said a growing climate of economic uncertainty over last two years is punctuated by increasing aggression toward foreign banks , changes to the fuel price formula , a flagrantly mismanaged state budget , and an increasing tendency to issue public procurements through no-bid contracts under the guise of " emergencies . 
" But , he said none of this matches the damage that would be done by [PER ALBA.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Despite his expression of opposition , [PER Bulnes  ] excused himself from leading the charge against [ORG ALBA  ] , citing the political risks of confronting the President . 
Nevertheless , he did not hesitate to encourage the Embassy to act against [ORG ALBA  ] before it is " too late , " suggesting we should place a call to [PER Micheletti  ] . 
( [PER Note: Bulnes  ] has a reputation as a strong supporter and close friend of President [PER Zelaya  ] , which he demonstrated through unmitigated support during the [LOC Toncontin  ] airport crisis . 
In a separate meeting , [ORG National Party  ] insider xxxxxxxxxxxx told [ORG Emboffs  ] that [PER Bulnes  ] is being paid by media magnate [PER Jaime Rosenthal  ] not to stand up to President [PER Zelaya  ] . 
Others , including [ORG Liberal Party  ] Congresswoman [PER Martha Alvarado  ] de [ORG Casco  ] , have also lamented the private sector 's lack of action on [ORG ALBA  ] . 
Two legal advisors employed by [ORG COHEP  ] told Econoff that , while [ORG COHEP  ] 's official line is in opposition to [ORG ALBA  ] , [PER Bulnes  ] secretly supports it due to his close ties to [PER Zelaya  ] . 
End Note ) . 
[PER Micheletti  ] 's Candidacy ---------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In order to actually put an [ORG ALBA  ] accession into force , the constitution requires that [PER Zelaya  ] obtain the approval of the [ORG Congress  ] -- which means [MISC Zeleya  ] needs [PER Micheletti  ] 's support . 
With dismal polling numbers , formerly confident [PER Micheletti  ] has been looking for allies to boost his chances [ORG TEGUCIGALP  ] 00000765 002 OF 003 in the presidential election , bringing [PER Yani Rosenthal  ] ( President [PER Manuel Zelaya  ] 's former Minister of the Presidency ) into his movement , and adding [PER Roland Valenzuela  ] , a suspected money launderer and drug trafficker who was publicly booted from Vice President [PER Santos'  ] camp . 
Both figures bring a heavy bankroll to the [PER Micheletti  ] campaign and suggest growing ties to [PER Zelaya  ] . 
On August 6 , the press reported that [PER Micheletti  ] had allegedly reached a deal on [ORG ALBA  ] with [PER Zelaya  ] . 
In exchange for the President 's support of his candidacy , [PER Micheletti  ] would reportedly ensure the approval of [ORG ALBA  ] in the [ORG Congress  ] . 
To support this rumor , on August 11 , [PER Santos  ] denounced publicly that a member of his movement - [PER Jose Alfredo Saavedra  ] - had been contacted by the secretary of one of [PER Micheletti  ] 's strongest supporters and instructed to " come and pick up his one million lempiras " ( approximately USD 52,000 ) in exchange for his positive vote on [ORG ALBA  ] . 
Apparently the secretary had been trying to reach [PER Jose Angel Saavedra  ] , but mistakenly contacted [ORG Liberal Party  ] Congressman in [PER Santos'  ] camp . 
The scandal brought to light what everyone already knew but could not prove - that the congress , and specifically the president of the congress , used discretionary congressional funds to buy votes . 
This bolstered the argument that [PER Micheletti  ] supports [ORG ALBA  ] . 
[PER Micheletti  ] Breaks with [PER Zelaya  ] ? -------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In an attempt to quash suspicion of a [MISC Zelaya-Micheletti  ] pact , Congresswoman [PER Alvarado  ] reported to emboffs on August 18 that [PER Micheletti  ] and [PER Zelaya  ] had met on August 15 and had suffered a major break . 
[PER Zelaya  ] reportedly declared that his government would continue to move towards a socialist system , to which [PER Micheletti  ] announced , " Then you will do it without me ! 
" [PER Alvarado  ] explained , however , that individual members of [ORG Congress  ] would be speaking out against [ORG ALBA  ] without [PER Micheletti  ] 's leadership because he had spent his political capital on other recent battles with [PER Zelaya  ] , such as securing his own Presidential candidacy , killing " [MISC Hoy No Circula  ] , " overriding the electoral reform veto , and ending the battle with the prosecutors ( see reftels A - D ) . 
She and several other sources have told us that [ORG ALBA  ] should only receive approximately 25 votes , and that it would die in [ORG Congress  ] . 
August 25th - the Signing ------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG ALBA  ] signing ceremony is scheduled to take place on August 25th and according to multiple sources , the President will be pulling out all the stops to get massive public attendance . 
On August 18 , the President interrupted all television broadcasts ( including private cable transmissions ) to tout supposed [ORG IMF  ] praise for the economic advances made by his administration , and then strongly urge people to attend the upcoming rally . 
Multiple sources inform us that attendees will be each be paid 250 lempiras to show up for the rally ( twice the average daily wage ) , plus lunch and transportation , plus 250 lempiras upon exiting the event . 
This is a substantial sum for an average [MISC Honduran  ] , and if the rumors are true , then we can expect huge crowds on August 25 , even if no one who attends understands what [ORG ALBA  ] is all about . 
Comment ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Although no draft of the [MISC Honduran  ] agreement with [ORG ALBA  ] seems to be under discussion or negotiation , [PER Zelaya  ] 's signature on the agreement appears a forgone conclusion . 
Though the only hope for its defeat is in [ORG Congress  ] , dearth of unified opposition there suggests it could succeed . 
As with any [ORG Congressional  ] action , [PER Micheletti  ] will be the key to the outcome on [ORG ALBA  ] . 
[PER Micheletti  ] has a long-standing reputation as a rabid anti-communist . 
We have learned , however , that he is completely unreliable when it comes to promises made about what he will do in the [ORG Congress  ] . 
We also know that [PER Micheletti  ] is power-hungry and his desire to become president is paramount . 
He has seen his candidacy and his polling numbers slip away and appears to be so desperate that he [ORG TEGUCIGALP  ] 00000765 003 OF 003 would include drug traffickers and other corrupt people on his candidate slates , just to get their money and support . 
If he believes supporting [ORG ALBA  ] will help his presidential prospects , he may end up supporting it .
