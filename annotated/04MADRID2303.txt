<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L MADRID 002303 SIPDIS E.O. 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 06/17/2014 TAGS: <a href='/tag/PGOV_0.html'>PGOV</a> <a href='/tag/ELAB_0.html'>ELAB</a> <a href='/tag/SP_0.html'>SP</a> SUBJECT: LABOR LEADER SKEPTICAL ON [MISC ZAPATERO Classified By: Political Counselor  ] [PER Kathleen Fitzpatrick  ] per 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Pol/Labor officer spoke June 16 with [PER Jose Maria Fidalgo  ] , Secretary General of [LOC Spain  ] 's largest trade union confederation , [ORG CCOO  ] ( [ORG Comisiones Obreras  ] ) . 
[PER Fidalgo  ] expressed a cautious , wait-and-see attitude toward the [ORG Zapatero  ] government . 
He said he was not yet convinced of [ORG Zapatero  ] 's seriousness . 
[ORG Zapatero  ] has made many promises on such issues as shifting more workers from part time contracts to full time employment . 
However , his government has not yet taken any concrete steps to deal with the problem . 
On this and other matters , there is the need to move from talk to action , [PER Fidalgo  ] said . 
He noted he had maintained cordial relations with [MISC Aznar  ] , but the relationship had become strained in the final [MISC Aznar  ] years . 
( He attributed this to [MISC Aznar  ] becoming more arrogant and isolated in his second term . 
) <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Fidalgo  ] criticized both [ORG Zapatero  ] and , in particular , Labor and Social Affairs Minister [PER Jesus Caldera  ] , for not knowing how to govern . 
He said they are acting as if they were still in the opposition or still campaigning . 
They don't know how to manage ; all they seem to know how to do is give speeches . 
This , he observed , contrasts with the [ORG Popular Party  ] , which still acts like it is governing and does not know how to act in opposition . 
[PER Fidalgo  ] attributed the confusion on both sides to the fact that neither the [ORG PP  ] nor the [ORG PSOE  ] thought the [ORG PSOE  ] would win the March 14 elections . 
As a result , neither leadership is prepared for the roles they now occupy . 
( [PER Fidalgo  ] commented that there was no doubt in his mind that the March 11 Madrid terror attacks had thrown the election to the [ORG PSOE  ] . 
He said that when people are frightened and confused , they opt for the easy solution , and that is what the [ORG PSOE  ] offered . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Fidalgo  ] told us that the [ORG CCOO  ] Director for [ORG International Affairs  ] , [PER Javier Doz  ] , had recently met [ORG AFL-CIO  ] President [PER Sweeney  ] in [LOC Geneva  ] . 
( Note: We invited [PER Doz  ] to participate in an [MISC International Visitors  ] program this fall and he has accepted . 
) [PER Fidalgo  ] said the [ORG CCOO  ] would like to expand its contacts with the [ORG AFL-CIO  ] , which , he said , had previously kept the [ORG CCOO  ] at arms length . 
[PER Fidalgo  ] commented that the [ORG CCOO  ] had added over 200,000 new members in the past five years and that its position and finances were solid . 
He noted that the unions had demonstrated their strength in June 2002 when they convoked a general strike and compelled the [MISC Aznar  ] government to back off on measures that would have established tight controls on unemployment benefits. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Precarious ( temporary contact ) employment is [LOC Spain  ] 's number one labor challenge , [PER Fidalgo  ] stated . 
Thirty-one percent of employees are on temporary contracts , a figure well above the [ORG EU  ] average . 
[PER Fidalgo  ] said one of the problems in making the temporary jobs permanent is their low skill , low productivity nature . 
The GOS will have to encourage business to invest more in these workers to raise their productivity . 
[PER Fidalgo  ] said he is pressing the [ORG Zapatero  ] government to adopt a program of regular consultations with the unions ; he believes [ORG Zapatero  ] will agree. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment: While [ORG CCOO  ] 's origins are on the left ( it was originally linked with [LOC Spain  ] 's communist party ) it has adopted an increasingly pragmatic posture in recent years under [PER Fidalgo  ] 's leadership . 
[PER Fidalgo  ] made a point of stressing to us his previous good relations with the [MISC Aznar  ] government , his skepticism about [ORG Zapatero  ] 's ability to deliver on his promises , and his desire for improved ties with the [ORG AFL-CIO  ] . 
He did not mention [LOC Iraq  ] . 
While the other main national labor federation , [ORG UGT  ] , is nominally independent , in reality its leaders are all Socialists . 
It was notable that [PER Fidalgo  ] expressed no sense of relief that a government of the left was in power . 
Indeed , he was often rolling his eyes as he discussed [ORG Zapatero  ] . 
On foreign policy , the [ORG CCOO  ] , while highly critical of [LOC US  ] policy in [LOC Iraq  ] , has been more moderate than the [ORG UGT  ] . 
[ORG CCOO International Affairs  ] Director [PER Doz  ] told us he agreed the war in [LOC Afghanistan  ] was necessary . 
The [ORG UGT  ] , by contrast , vehemently opposed [LOC US  ] action in both [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] .
