MUNICH 355 <a id='parB' href='#parB'>¶</a>B . 
MUNICH 351 Classified By: Consul General [PER Eric Nelson  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . 
SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Bavarian  ] [ORG Christian Social Union  ] ( [ORG CSU  ] ) , dangerously weakened , is attempting to sharpen its profile among [MISC Bavarian  ] and national voters , by pursuing an aggressive economic campaign that diverges from that of its sister party , [PER Chancellor Merkel  ] 's [ORG Christian Democrats  ] . 
The [ORG CSU  ] is finding plenty of opportunities to profile itself locally and nationally in addressing the challenges presented by the financial crisis . 
For one , [MISC Bavarian  ] Minister President [PER Seehofer  ] has threatened to boycott the January 5 " coalition summit " if [PER Chancellor Merkel  ] does not bend to the [ORG CSU  ] 's recipe for responding to [LOC Germany  ] 's economic downturn through a tax reform proposal . 
[PER Merkel  ] needs a strong [ORG CSU  ] showing in [LOC Bavaria  ] to achieve her goal of a CDU/CSU-FDP coalition after the 2009 national elections , but the [ORG CSU  ] 's strategy could build tensions between the sister parties . 
How the [MISC CDU-CSU  ] divisions play out could influence national economic policy as well as how the upcoming campaign will shape up in the months to come . 
End Summary . 
[ORG CSU  ] SALTING THE CDU'S SOUP -------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG CSU  ] still holds [PER Chancellor Merkel  ] partly responsible for the [ORG CSU  ] 's poor outcome in the September 2008 state elections . 
[PER Merkel  ] failed to support the [ORG CSU  ] , for example , on the tax deductibility of commuting costs , one of the [ORG CSU  ] 's key issues that the [ORG CDU  ] had rejected until the latest ruling by the [ORG Federal Constitutional Court  ] that agreed with the position of the [ORG CSU  ] . 
[PER Erwin Huber  ] , former head of the [ORG CSU  ] , said " the [ORG CDU  ] should have listened to us instead of Finance Minister [PER Steinbrueck  ] ( [ORG SPD  ] ) on this sensitive issue . 
" <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Karl-Theodor zu [PER Guttenberg  ] , Secretary General of the [ORG CSU  ] ( [ORG PROTECT  ] ) , told the Consul General on December 17 that the [ORG CSU  ] is " heating up the debate " and will meet on January 4 " to map out a strategy for the 2009 election campaign , " adding , " We want to be more like the party was under [PER Edmund Stoiber  ] and [PER Franz Josef Straus  ] ( both legendary former Minister Presidents ) . 
" Or , as [PER Hartmut Kotschyk  ] ( [ORG CSU  ] party whip in the [ORG Bundestag  ] ) put it to the P/E Chief recently , " We want to be the salt in their soup . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Zu Guttenberg  ] and [ORG Koschyk  ] reviewed possible approaches the [ORG CSU  ] would take with its platform for 2009. a ) Taking a hard line against [ORG EU  ] membership not only for [LOC Turkey  ] but also for [LOC Ukraine  ] . 
The [ORG CSU  ] could lump [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Ukraine  ] together so neither country could feel singled out for bad treatment . 
The [ORG CSU  ] 's new foreign policy spokeswoman in the [ORG Bundestag  ] , [PER Dorothee Baer  ] , told [LOC Berlin  ] PolMC that this would be a focus of the [ORG CSU  ] 's campaign for [MISC European  ] Parliament elections in June 2009. b ) Insisting on more [ORG EU  ] " subsidiarity . 
" The [ORG CSU  ] wants more respect for national and regional and local prerogatives in governance and administrative control , such as allowing restrictions on bioengineered seeds. c ) Strengthening and refocusing the economy . 
The [ORG CSU  ] wants a renewed commitment to human over financial capital as a way to address what [ORG Koschyk  ] called " a believability problem among the rank and file [MISC Germans  ] for the market economy . 
" [PER Zu Guttenberg  ] complained that " [PER Merkel  ] was not being assertive enough on the economy , " echoing recent statements by [PER Horst Seehofer  ] , [MISC Bavarian  ] Minister President ( [ORG CSU  ] ) . 
However , he also admitted that he could understand her approach since he found her to be " personally conservative " and " not one to be in the front on bold initiatives . 
" He expected she was " trying to maintain her options in 2009 " as well as " trying to stay close to the coalition [ORG Social Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG SPD  ] ) . 
" BAVARIA'S PRESIDENT CUTTING A MEAN FIGURE ----------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Finally , [PER MP Seehofer  ] has criticized the [ORG CDU  ] in public around [LOC Bavaria  ] , in [LOC Berlin  ] , and in the media , which reported that [ORG CDU  ] leaders viewed his actions as " unpredictable " because he made proposals that strayed from MUNICH 00000423 002 of 002 the coalition 's party line . 
He criticized the [PER Chancellor  ] 's economic course , for example , arguing that [LOC Germany  ] needed a larger and more meaningful program than the [PER Chancellor  ] had supported . 
[PER Seehofer  ] preserved the independence of [MISC Bavarian  ] control over the [ORG Bayerische Landesbank  ] ( [ORG BayernLB  ] ) by rejecting the [ORG Federal  ] rescue package in an attempt to use only [MISC Bavarian  ] resources . 
And , he pushed for immediate tax deductions , not just some time after the election . 
COMMENT: CREATING INDIVIDUALITY WITHOUT KILLING EACH OTHER --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Chancellor [PER Merkel  ] and the [ORG CDU  ] need a strong and cooperative [MISC Bavarian  ] [ORG CSU  ] partner in order to win the 2009 [ORG Bundestag  ] election . 
Down in [LOC Bavaria  ] , the [ORG CSU  ] must get stronger , too , and is fighting for its uniqueness as a regional party with national and international credentials . 
Although the ultimate goals are compatible , the [ORG CSU  ] necessarily must set itself apart from the [ORG CDU  ] to prove itself to skeptical locals who knocked the [ORG CSU  ] off its high horse in the last election . 
The challenge for both parties is to allow the [ORG CSU  ] to profile itself without killing the relationship , and each other 's chances , with an overly aggressive factional campaign. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 .
