REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C/NF ) [MISC Summary: While  ] [LOC Libya  ] has a number of other pressing foreign policy issues on its plate , the case of convicted [MISC Pan Am 103  ] bomber Abdelbasset al-Megrahi is arguably the regime’s most sensitive political subject , in part because it involves a firm timeline in the form of the ailing el-Megrahi’s approaching death . 
Through remarks by senior officials suggesting that al-Megrahi is innocent and a steady diet of publicity about his case , the regime has limited its room for political maneuver . 
[LOC U.K.  ] Embassy interlocutors here are planning for a scenario in which the [ORG U.K.-Libya Prisoner Transfer Agreement  ] is ratified in early March and the [ORG GOL  ] makes application shortly thereafter for al-Megrahi’s transfer to [LOC Libya  ] . 
The [LOC U.K.  ] Embassy expects a sharply negative [ORG GOL  ] reaction if al-Megrahi dies in prison or if the [ORG Scottish Executive  ] and/or [ORG FCO  ] oppose his transfer . 
The [LOC U.K.  ] Embassy has recommended dramatic pre-emptive measures , to include drawing down their mission in [LOC Tripoli  ] , if either of those possibilities occurs . 
If the [ORG USG  ] publicly opposes al-Megrahi’s release - or is perceived to be complicit in a decision that results in al-Megrahi remaining in prison - the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Embassy  ] and private [MISC Americans  ] in [LOC Libya  ] could face similar consequences . 
End summary . 
AL-MEGRAHI’S CASE IS THE GOL’S MOST SENSITIVE AT PRESENT <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) Consistent with information reported reftel , [LOC U.K.  ] Emboffs here have interpreted the lengthy and repeated visits to the [LOC U.K.  ] by [ORG MFA A/S-equivalent  ] for [ORG European Affairs  ] [PER Abdulati Obeidi  ] and [ORG External Security Organization  ] Director [PER Musa Kusa  ] in connection with the matter of convicted [MISC Pan Am 103  ] bomber Abdelbasset al-Megrahi as reflecting the great political importance the [ORG GOL  ] attaches to successfully resolving ( from the GOL’s perspective ) the case . 
Contacts here have told us that [PER Ahmed el-Msellati  ] , a senior regime legal adviser/fixer who played a pivotal role in finalizing and implementing the [MISC U.S.-Libya  ] claims compensation agreement , has also visited the [LOC U.K.  ] to consult with al-Megrahi’s defense team and [ORG FCO  ] officials . 
While the [ORG GOL  ] has a number of other pressing foreign policy issues on its plate - moving forward with re-established [MISC U.S.-Libya  ] ties , reacting to the [LOC Gaza  ] crisis , managing its role as the only current [MISC Arab  ] member of the [ORG UNSC  ] , mediating between [LOC Chad  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] , resolving its contretemps with the [MISC Swiss  ] , and initiatives in [LOC sub-Saharan Africa  ] - al-Megrahi’s case is arguably the most critical and sensitive political subject at present . 
That is so because the regime has widely publicized developments in his case and because , unlike other foreign policy priorities , al-Megrahi’s situation involves an immutable timeline in the form of his approaching death from cancer . 
In media interviews last August , senior regime figure Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi said al-Megrahi was innocent and that [LOC Libya  ] had accepted responsibility for [MISC Pan Am 103  ] and allowed al-Megrahi and co-defendant al-Amin [PER Khalifah Fhima  ] to be tried in order to facilitate Libya’s re-assimilation into the international community after years of isolation under international sanctions . 
Those comments , together with a steady diet of articles in [MISC Libyan  ] state-owned newspapers about al-Megrahi’s case and the travails of his family in [LOC Glasgow  ] , have raised expectations among ordinary [MISC Libyans  ] that the regime will secure his release , and have limited the GOL’s room for political maneuver . 
[LOC U.K.  ] EMBASSY FOCUSED ON TRANSFER UNDER PTA AND SECURITY POSTURE <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) [LOC U.K.  ] Embassy interlocutors here tell us they are planning for a scenario in which the [ORG U.K.-Libya Prisoner Transfer Agreement  ] ( [ORG PTA  ] ) is ratified in early March and the [ORG GOL  ] makes application shortly thereafter for al-Megrahi’s transfer to [LOC Libya  ] . 
They do not anticipate that [ORG GOL  ] officials will pursue another application for bail , and said they had no information from the [ORG FCO  ] to suggest that al-Megrahi’s application for compassionate release , which was denied in November , would be re-submitted in light of his deteriorating medical condition . 
[LOC U.K.  ] Emboffs began consulting with us in December about deliberations concerning their security posture and tripwires for action should al-Megrahi die in [MISC Scottish  ] prison . 
Consistent with information reported reftel , [ORG GOL  ] officials have warned [LOC U.K.  ] Emboffs in demarches here that the consequences for the [ORG U.K.-Libya  ] bilateral relationship would be “dire” were al-Megrahi to die in [MISC Scottish  ] prison . 
Specific threats have included the immediate cessation of all [LOC U.K.  ] commercial activity in [LOC Libya  ] , a diminishment or severing of political ties and demonstrations against official [LOC U.K.  ] facilities . 
[ORG GOL  ] officials also implied , but did not directly state , that the welfare of [LOC U.K.  ] diplomats and citizens in [LOC Libya  ] would be at risk. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) Citing demonstrations in [LOC Benghazi  ] against the [MISC Italian  ] consulate in 2006 that rapidly turned violent ( ref B ) and the quick curtailment of direct air links in the ongoing [MISC Swiss-Libyan  ] dispute ( ref C ) , the [MISC U.K. Embassy  ] has reportedly recommended to [LOC London  ] that the following pre-emptive measures be taken immediately if al-Megrahi were to die in prison or if the transfer under the [ORG PTA  ] were to be denied: 1 ) close the [ORG British School  ] ; 2 ) close the [ORG British Council  ] ; 3 ) issue a travel advisory/warden message-equivalent advising [MISC British  ] nationals to exercise extreme caution and/or leave [LOC Libya  ] ; and 4 ) draw the [LOC U.K.  ] mission down to only essential personnel . 
The failure of [LOC Switzerland  ] and [LOC Libya  ] to resolve the dispute prompted by the arrest of [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi’s son , [PER Hannibal  ] , last July has convinced [LOC U.K.  ] Emboffs that the consequences if al-Megrahi were to die in prison or if the transfer under the [ORG PTA  ] were denied would be harsh , immediate and not easily remedied . 
IMPLICATIONS FOR [LOC U.S.  ] INTERESTS <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) If the [ORG USG  ] publicly opposes al-Megrahi’s release ( or is perceived to be complicit in a decision to keep al-Megrahi in prison ) , Post judges that [LOC U.S.  ] interests could face similar consequences , including regime-orchestrated demonstrations against the [MISC Embassy  ] , retaliation against [LOC U.S.  ] business interests and possible obstruction of the travel of official and private [MISC Americans  ] , as occurred in the case of the [MISC Swiss  ] . 
( [MISC Note: Unlike  ] recent demonstrations against the [MISC Swiss  ] ( [MISC Swiss-Libyan  ] dispute ) and [MISC Egyptian  ] embassies ( in connection with [LOC Gaza  ] ) , in which the regime mustered crowds that dutifully went through the paces , al-Megrahi’s case is a genuinely emotive one for ordinary [MISC Libyans  ] ; demonstrations would likely be more energetic and harder for the [ORG GOL  ] to control . 
End note . 
) Some variation of that scenario is possible , though not as likely , if al-Megrahi were to die in prison without the [ORG USG  ] having declared a position . 
The fact that the [ORG GOL  ] did not orchestrate and apparently did not sanction protests against [LOC U.S.  ] facilities in connection with events in [LOC Gaza  ] gives cause for cautious optimism that the [ORG GOL  ] might distinguish between [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC U.K.  ] interests in such a case , although the [ORG GOL  ] essentially views the [MISC Pan Am 103  ] case as a joint [MISC U.S.-U.K.  ] issue. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) Comment: Despite the GOL’s strategic decision in 2003 to take steps to facilitate its acceptance back into the community of nations , the regime remains essentially thuggish in its approach , particularly on issues it perceives to involve domestic political equities . 
The over-reaction of [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi to what amounted to a matter of pride involving a verbal spat with then-Crown Prince [PER Abdullah  ] at the 2003 [ORG Arab League Summit  ] , together with the more recent deterioration of [MISC Swiss-Libyan  ] ties , are illustrative of what may happen should al-Megrahi die in prison . 
The regime understands that we have equities in this case: on the margins of the former [MISC Secretary’s  ] visit to [LOC Tripoli  ] in September , senior regime figure [PER Abdullah Sanussi  ] asked former [ORG NEA A/S  ] [PER David Welch  ] to influence [MISC Pan Am 103  ] families not to oppose al-Megrahi’s transfer ( [PER Welch  ] demurred ) . 
The issue of al-Megrahi is sensitive enough for the regime that there may be repercussions for our interests here even if we remain neutral ; there will almost certainly be consequences if we publicly take a position opposing his transfer . 
By contrast with the [MISC Swiss  ] problem , which is seen as an issue over the reprehensible behavior of [PER Hannibal  ] al-Qadhafi , al-Megrahi is effectively viewed as something of a folks hero in the eyes of the regime and many ordinary [MISC Libyans  ] .
