( C ) Summary . 
As [LOC Brazil  ] takes an increasingly prominent place on the international stage , its [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] , known widely as [ORG Itamaraty  ] after its headquarters building , finds itself under the influence of four powerful personalities whose ideologies are shaping its foreign policy priorities and interaction with the [LOC United States  ] . 
Over the last six years , President [PER Lula  ] 's relatively pragmatic effort to expand [LOC Brazil  ] 's outreach to a growing group of countries , including the [LOC United States  ] , has been implemented differently by the [ORG GOB  ] 's three principal foreign policy actors: the nationalist Foreign Minister [PER Celso Amorim  ] , the anti-American Secretary General ( deputy Foreign Minister ) [PER Samuel Pinheiro Guimaraes  ] , and the academic leftist presidential Foreign Policy Advisor [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] . 
Along with President [PER Lula  ] , the three have pulled the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] in unaccustomed and sometimes different directions. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The departure of deputy [PER FM Guimaraes  ] in November 2009 and a new administration in January 2011 are likely to again modify the [ORG GOB  ] 's foreign policy ideologies and priorities . 
As we seek to broaden and deepen our relationship with [ORG Itamaraty  ] , ideological dynamics will make [ORG Itamaraty  ] a sometimes frustrating partner . 
Even so , the opportunity exists now to move forward by working with other [MISC Brazilian  ] institutions , and to shape the views of a large cohort of younger , more pragmatic , and more globally oriented diplomats who will be moving into senior ranks . 
[ORG Para  ] 16 contains two proposals post is actively exploring . 
( Note: This is the first of three cables examining the influences on [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] . 
A second will report on the institutional strains affecting [ORG Itamaraty  ] . 
A third will examine the inter-agency struggles that are slowly eroding [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's foreign policy primacy ; see also paras 13-14 below .

) End summary. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - President [PER Lula:  ] The [MISC Pragmatic Leftist  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) President [PER Lula  ] arrived in office in 2003 with little foreign affairs experience and a broadly leftist approach to international affairs in which more developed countries stood against less developed countries on the world stage . 
In practice , however , [PER Lula  ] has demonstrated a gift for personalizing foreign policy through contacts with foreign leaders and a penchant for taking a pragmatic rather than an ideological approach to working with other countries . 
As a result , [PER Lula  ] has significantly shaped [LOC Brazil  ] 's foreign policy efforts , as his good working relationships with leaders from across the political spectrum have helped increase [MISC Brazilian  ] influence and standing , while paving the way for closer cooperation between [LOC Brazil  ] and a growing number of global actors , including the [LOC United States  ] . 
But there remains a notable tension between [PER Lula  ] 's actions and his rhetoric , which often takes on a [MISC North-South  ] , " us versus them " cast . 
This tension keeps [ORG Itamaraty  ] on edge , and has opened the door for [PER Amorim  ] , [PER Guimaraes  ] , and [PER Garcia  ] to formulate and implement [LOC Brazil  ] 's foreign policy in different ways . 
[LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000177 002 OF 005 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 'Three Foreign [PER Ministers' Make  ] for Unhappy Diplomats - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Most analysts agree that [PER Lula  ] is not the principal architect of his administration 's foreign policy vision , nor the principal overseer of its implementation . 
In this regard , contacts almost universally cite [PER FM Amorim  ] , [PER SG Guimaraes  ] , and Advisor [PER Garcia  ] as nearly co-equal with regard to their influence in determining the broad outlines and scope of [LOC Brazil  ] 's foreign policy . 
All three are leftist in their basic ideology , but each has taken on a specific leadership role , approaches his job with a different slant , relates in a different manner to President [PER Lula  ] , and receives support from a different base . 
Each has carved out his own foreign policy niche: trade , developed country relations , multilateral issues , [LOC Africa  ] , and the [LOC Middle East  ] for [PER Amorim  ] ; political-military issues , relations with some developing countries , and [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] inner workings for [PER Guimaraes  ] ; and [MISC South American  ] and leftist countries in [LOC Latin America  ] and elsewhere for [PER Garcia  ] . 
The effect is a somewhat disjointed vision and implementation of [LOC Brazil  ] 's foreign policy that can lead to frustration on the part of [MISC Brazilian  ] diplomats. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Where the interests of these three advisors coincide in their views , [LOC Brazil  ] 's direction has been unequivocal: prioritizing regional political integration , deepening relations with emerging economies ( e.g. , through the [LOC BRICs  ] and [LOC IBSA--India  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC South Africa--fora  ] ) , expanding south-south relations ( e.g. , through [LOC Arab States-South America  ] , [LOC South America-Africa  ] , and [MISC Latin America-wide  ] fora ) , and increasing dialogue with other regional powers ( [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] , [LOC China  ] , [LOC North Korea  ] ) to highlight its position as a friend of both the [LOC United States  ] and its adversaries . 
None of the three admits that there is any interest or effort to place relations with [LOC Europe  ] and the [LOC United States  ] on a second plane , and staffing at [LOC Brazil  ] 's foreign missions seems to bear this out ( see septel ) . 
However , there is a growing debate among the non-government foreign policy elite in [LOC Brazil  ] ( refs A and B ) , and substantial opposition from the private sector , regarding the wisdom of what is widely acknowledged as a heavy south-south focus . 
This debate expresses publicly the discomfort that many diplomats express privately with the direction of [LOC Brazil  ] 's foreign policy under [PER Lula  ] . 
Diplomats tell us that the leftist slant to policy has resulted in " exile " either overseas or to domestic postings outside [ORG Itamaraty  ] ( at universities , for example ) , self-exile overseas , or early retirement for more senior colleagues. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - FM Amorim: the [MISC Nationalist Leftist  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) For all the sniping at [PER Lula  ] 's foreign policy from senior ex-diplomats--and such criticism is constant , public , and widespread--Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] is one of their own , a respected career diplomat steeped in traditional [ORG Itamaraty  ] nationalism . 
Historically , this expressed itself in opposition to the [LOC United States  ] , and it is still unquestionably true that , within [LOC South America  ] , [ORG Itamaraty  ] resists almost without exception regional initiatives involving the [LOC United States  ] . 
When the [LOC United States  ] is at the table , in [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's view , [LOC Brazil  ] cannot lead . 
This may explain why [ORG Itamaraty  ] remains lukewarm regarding the [ORG Summit  ] of the [ORG Americas  ] , has rejected cooperation with us in [LOC South America  ] on biofuels , and has launched a number of initiatives in [LOC South America  ] that do not include the [LOC United States  ] . 
Most recently , the December 2008 Bahia summits ( refs C , D , E ) , including the first-ever meeting of [MISC Latin American  ] and [MISC Caribbean  ] heads of state and government , represented an effort by [LOC Brazil  ] to expand the scope of its leadership in the [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000177 003 OF 005 region , without having to play second fiddle to the [LOC United States.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Under [PER Amorim  ] 's most recent tenure as Foreign Minister , however , [ORG Itamaraty  ] nationalism has undergone a subtle shift . 
( [PER Note: Amorim  ] also served as FM for 18 months under President [PER Itamar Franco  ] , 1993-1994 . 
He has served as FM under [PER Lula  ] since 2003 . 
End note . 
) Over the last several years , a broader , once nearly knee-jerk anti-Americanism has given way to a growing desire to have a seat among global players addressing global issues , to be and be perceived as being an equal to [LOC Europe  ] , [LOC China  ] , [LOC India  ] , [LOC Japan  ] , and the [LOC United States  ] on the world stage ( ref F ) . 
The most notable expressions of this tendency have been the renewed primacy given [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's long-standing effort to secure a permanent seat on the [ORG UN Security Council  ] , a constructive and engaged role in the [ORG WTO  ] negotiations ( under pressure from [LOC Brazil  ] 's private sector ) , interest in playing in the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process , and most recently active engagement in discussions on the global financial crisis . 
Compared with [PER Guimaraes  ] and [PER Garcia  ] , [PER Amorim  ] 's leftist views tend to be held in check by traditional [ORG Itamaraty  ] care for diplomatic niceties and an almost reverential respect for reciprocity and multilateralism . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's recent decision to grant refugee status to an [MISC Italian  ] terrorist ( ref G ) , for example , was clearly made by the Justice Minister for ideological reasons , and almost certainly without [PER Amorim  ] 's support. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Secretary General [PER Guimaraes:  ] the [MISC Anti-American Leftist  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) One former diplomat told [MISC PolCouns  ] that [PER SG Guimaraes  ] , a career diplomat who was shunted aside by President [PER Cardoso  ] , owes his influence and independence to being the [ORG Labor Party  ] 's ( [ORG PT  ] ) first choice for FM after [PER Lula  ] was elected . 
[PER Guimaraes  ] believed he was not confirmable and suggested [PER Amorim  ] , with himself as Secretary [PER General--a  ] move the [ORG PT  ] made , but which required congress to pass a waiver , as [PER Guimaraes  ] had not served as ambassador , a legal requirement to hold the post . 
Along with family connections ( Guimaraes' daughter is married to [PER Amorim  ] 's son ) , this history may explain his outsized authority and substantial autonomy. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Guimaraes  ] is virulently anti-American , and anti- " first world " in general . 
He has advocated extreme positions--for example , that in order to be taken seriously on the world stage [LOC Brazil  ] must develop nuclear weapons--and as the senior official in charge of personnel matters , he issued a required reading list of anti-American books that has only recently been toned down . 
He has been accused by current and former diplomats of using ideological requirements in handing out promotions . 
And he is known to have gone out of his way to provoke and stall initiatives by [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC European  ] countries . 
Politico-military affairs , which are managed largely out of his office , and counter-crime/counter-drug issues ( managed by him until earlier this year , and still subject to his influence ) remain two of our most difficult areas for bilateral cooperation at the policy level , with initiatives regularly stalled or stymied by [ORG Itamaraty  ] . 
According to [MISC European  ] and [MISC Canadian  ] diplomats , our problems with [PER Guimaraes  ] are not unique , and they are awaiting as eagerly as we are his mandatory retirement in November 2009 , when he turns 70. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Advisor Garcia: the [MISC Academic Leftist  ] - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Many contacts , including most recently Defense Minister [PER Nelson Jobim  ] ( ref H ) , tell us that [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] is one of President 's closest advisors , enjoying a [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000177 004 OF 005 longstanding personal relationship with him and exercising an outsized influence . 
An academic leftist and long-time [ORG PT  ] member , [PER Garcia  ] has championed closer relations with leftist governments in the region and beyond , as well as the prioritization of south-south relations . 
Talking with [MISC Americans  ] , he tends to couch negative views of the [LOC United States  ] as good-natured jokes from the past ( " When I was young , we used to call the [ORG OAS  ] 'the [ORG Ministry of U.S. Colonies'  ] " ; " When I was a young man , the joke was , 'Why has the [LOC United States  ] never had a coup ? 
Because it doesn't have a [LOC U.S.  ] embassy ! 
' " ) . 
In the present , he has taken on President [PER Lula  ] 's pragmatic approach to foreign policy , dealing with the [LOC United States  ] and other non-leftist countries in order to achieve [PER Lula  ] 's objectives . 
Since the new [ORG U.S. Administration  ] has come on board , he has been emphatic in passing along [PER Lula  ] 's keen desire to meet soon with President [PER Obama.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Garcia  ] 's influence as [PER Lula  ] 's most trusted foreign policy advisor remains undiminished despite harsh criticism from [LOC Brazil  ] 's foreign policy elite for being too " soft " on its neighbors , which temporarily gave [ORG Itamaraty  ] the upper hand in managing the spate of problems between [LOC Brazil  ] and [LOC Bolivia  ] , [LOC Ecuador  ] , [LOC Paraguay  ] , and [LOC Argentina  ] in late 2008 . 
[PER Garcia  ] maintains the lead on contacts with [LOC South America  ] 's leftist governments , and where he is not the author of [LOC Brazil  ] 's outreach to countries such as [LOC Cuba  ] , [LOC South Africa  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , and [LOC Russia  ] , he is fully supportive and active in advancing these relationships. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Comment: Prepare for the [LOC Challenge...and  ] the Change - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The ideological forces currently dominating [ORG Itamaraty  ] mean that , in the near term , the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] will continue to represent a challenge for [LOC U.S.  ] engagement on many issues . 
At least through the end of the [PER Lula  ] administration , the ideological bent of certain key policymakers will constrain cooperation in some areas . 
Pursuing initiatives with Brazil--and particularly those not dear to the principal foreign policymakers--will continue to require a substantial investment of time , strategic preparation , and effort to overcome ideological headwinds , bureaucratic inertia , and more pressing priorities ( see also septels ) . <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) In particular , although [ORG Itamaraty  ] will remain a significant player on almost all [LOC U.S.  ] initiatives and interests in [LOC Brazil  ] , the way forward with the [ORG GOB  ] will in large measure involve working with other significant players as well . 
In the first instance , this means the Presidency , as [PER Lula  ] has made clear his interest in developing a closer relationship with the [LOC United States  ] and [PER Garcia  ] , his closest advisor , is the most dependable in reflecting views . 
Second , this means working with other [ORG GOB  ] ministries and agencies that will act as advocates for closer cooperation . 
Finally , it means drawing in congress , the judiciary , governors , and non-governmental players , and the private sector in particular , which generally support working with the [LOC United States  ] and often have the ability to sway decisions in favor of our initiatives. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) Building supportive coalitions with other [MISC Brazilian  ] players as a way to overcome [ORG MRE  ] opposition is a tested strategy: on the [ORG Tropical Forests Conservation Act  ] debt swap , enhanced visa terms , our NAS LOA , civil aviation , defense cooperation , biofuels cooperation , information sharing , climate change , and a host of other issues , developing initiatives with and working through players other than [ORG Itamaraty  ] have been critical elements in our success . 
Most recently , excellent relations with the [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] , [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000177 005 OF 005 Federal Police , and the Presidency were crucial to overcoming last-minute [ORG MRE  ] refusal to issue visas to [ORG DEA  ] agents preparing to transfer from [LOC Bolivia  ] to [LOC Brazil  ] ( see septel ) . 
We expect that gaining [MISC Brazilian  ] cooperation on climate change and hemispheric energy security will also depend heavily on working closely with players outside [ORG Itamaraty.  ] <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Over the longer term , in light of the [ORG GOB  ] 's current efforts to adjust to broader participation on the world stage , we expect that senior [ORG Itamaraty  ] policymakers will continue to expand the range of issues on which they are comfortable working in tandem with industrialized countries . 
During the next decade , the older generation of diplomats , who still often defined their interests as a regional power in opposition to the [LOC United States  ] , will be replaced by a large cohort of younger , more pragmatic , and more globally oriented officers . 
The recognition by at least some senior [ORG Itamaraty  ] officials that they have not done a good job of training " [MISC Americanists  ] " who understand the [LOC United States  ] suggests that there may well be increased openness to new initiatives on this front , especially following the departure of [PER Samuel Guimaraes  ] in 2009 . 
Openness may increase further in 2011 if the [PER Lula  ] government is replaced by one with a less ideological set of senior policymakers. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Post believes that it is critical to influence [LOC Brazil  ] 's new generation of diplomats , which we generally find more accessible and , while still strong nationalists , more ready to consider cooperation where [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] interests coincide . 
Among the new near-term possibilities we are exploring is the possibility of establishing a more regular program of speakers and digital video conferences with [LOC Rio Branco  ] to promote engagement between their diplomatic trainees and [LOC U.S.  ] diplomats and other interlocutors . 
Depending on how this is received , we might consider establishing a " young diplomats " group to allow for additional contact and exposure with [LOC U.S.  ] diplomats . 
Post has also learned that the [MISC French  ] instituted a diplomatic exchange program with [ORG Itamaraty  ] in 2008 , similar to our [ORG Transatlantic Diplomatic Fellowship  ] , and now have a diplomat working in [ORG Itamaraty  ] 's [ORG Europe Department  ] . 
We believe a similar proposal would be a valuable way both to test the waters for cooperation and , if implemented , both to gain further insight into the workings of this key ministry and to give [MISC Brazilian  ] diplomats greater understanding of how the [ORG USG  ] executes foreign policy .
