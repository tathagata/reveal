( [ORG SBU  ] ) Key points: -The U.S.-Egypt [ORG Strategic Economic Dialogue  ] was launched in 2009 , and the [ORG USG  ] will have to overcome weak [ORG GOE  ] inter-ministerial cooperation to move forward on the dialogue 's goals in 2010. -The key [LOC U.S.  ] objectives in its economic relationship with [LOC Egypt  ] are deepening bilateral trade and investment , helping [LOC Egypt  ] to improve its domestic and international commerce , increasing [LOC U.S.  ] exports to [LOC Egypt  ] , supporting the [ORG Qualifying Industrial Zones  ] ( [ORG QIZ  ] ) program , and helping [LOC Egypt  ] to improve its [ORG IPR  ] climate and reduce non-tariff trade barriers , particularly in agricultural products. -The [LOC U.S.  ] interagency strategy to meet its objectives includes gathering key [ORG GOE  ] stakeholders , offering technical assistance where appropriate , and leveraging visits by high-level [ORG USG  ] officials and by working-level officials from the [LOC US  ] and the region to move the process forward . 
Overview of [ORG Strategic Economic Partnership  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The dialogue with the [ORG GOE  ] is built upon the Plan for a [ORG Strategic Economic Partnership  ] on [MISC Trade-Related  ] and [ORG Investment Issues  ] signed by [LOC United States  ] Trade Representative ( [ORG USTR  ] ) [PER Ron Kirk  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] 's Minister of Trade and Industry ( [ORG MOTI  ] ) [PER Rachid M. Rachid  ] in [LOC Washington  ] in May 2009 . 
In November 2009 , [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Egyptian  ] private companies agreed upon the creation of a [ORG Business Leaders' Forum  ] endorsed by [PER Min  ] . 
[PER Rachid  ] and Commerce Secretary [PER Locke  ] , and [PER Min  ] . 
[PER Rachid  ] and [ORG USTR  ] [PER Kirk  ] finalized a work plan for a [ORG Joint Forum  ] on Trade and [ORG Investment.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Since finalizing the work plan , progress has been slow , largely because of the weak inter-ministerial cooperation on the part of the [ORG GOE  ] . 
For this reason , the [ORG USG  ] will have to take the lead in moving forward to advance our key objectives in our bilateral economic relationship with [LOC Egypt  ] , which are as follows: Deepening the Bilateral Trade and [ORG Investment Relationship  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In our engagement with [LOC Egypt  ] in a strategic economic dialogue , we seek to deepen bilateral trade and investment . 
Amidst the economic crisis in 2009 , U.S.-Egypt bilateral trade fell to $7.3 billion , a decrease from $8.4 billion in 2008 . 
There have , however , been a few strategic commercial successes , including the recent $650 million [ORG Boeing  ] contract for the purchase of eight 737 aircraft and the $50 million [ORG Hill International  ] contract to manage the construction of the new [MISC Egyptian  ] Grand [MISC Museum.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) We seek to expand our exports to [LOC Egypt  ] , and to work with [LOC Egypt  ] where appropriate to help it achieve its own ambitious goals of doubling exports and improving domestic commerce in the coming years . 
We also hope to achieve expanded trade in services , including promoting the development of [LOC Egypt  ] 's logistics and distribution , while liberalizing trade in [LOC U.S.  ] services , including franchising . 
We are also looking to improve labor and environmental standards in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
Improving [ORG IPR  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Building on recent successes in improving the intellectual property rights ( [ORG IPR  ] ) climate in [LOC Egypt  ] , it is important that we identify and address remaining areas of concern . 
[LOC Egypt  ] remains on the Special 301 Watch List as much remains to be done to improve copyright protection for [LOC US  ] music , film and books in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
Copyright is an area of mutual interest as [LOC Egypt  ] - historically a center of culture in the [LOC Middle East  ] -- has experienced economic losses due to [ORG IPR  ] infringement . 
We should focus on building on this mutual interest , and be sure to acknowledge the fact that the [ORG GOE  ] has been working with [ORG IPR  ] stakeholders in copyright and publishing , and we should encourage the [ORG GOE  ] to do more. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) We will continue to work with [LOC Egypt  ] on [ORG PTO  ] and [ORG USAID  ] training and capacity-building programs . 
These include economic court judges training , assistance in finalizing a new [ORG Border Measures Law  ] , and best practices workshops and visits with enforcement officials to improve [LOC Egypt  ] 's border measures against counterfeit goods , its patent and trademark implementation , its pharmaceutical registry , and its enforcement of laws against pirated books , music , and film . 
Increasing Agricultural Trade <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Another major goal is increasing [LOC U.S.  ] agricultural exports , by seeking [LOC Egypt  ] 's cooperation in liberalizing imports of beef products , seed potatoes and poultry parts . 
The [LOC US  ] is also seeking [LOC Egypt  ] 's cooperation in ending 100% inspection and testing of agricultural containerized shipments . 
Finally , the [LOC US  ] is encouraging [LOC Egypt  ] to pass a new bio-safety law that takes a science-based approach to agricultural bio-technology . 
[ORG QIZ  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During AUSTR [PER Gail Strickler  ] 's December 2009 visit to [LOC Cairo  ] , she energized both [ORG MOTI  ] and the private sector when she reiterated our commitment to the [ORG QIZ  ] program and raised the possibility of including additional areas and factories . 
Post would like to aggressively move beyond the current impasse over fairly modest technical issues ( ref . 
A ) to embrace the original goals of the [ORG QIZ  ] program: Strengthening the [MISC Egyptian-Israeli  ] political relationship through closer economic ties and promoting stability within [LOC Egypt  ] through the creation of jobs and economic opportunity . 
To this end , we would like to explore ways to quickly work with the [ORG GOE  ] to improve this valuable preference program , while ensuring that proper oversight of the program continues . 
[ORG USG Strategy  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) With an interagency process led by [ORG USTR  ] and including [ORG USAID  ] and the [ORG Departments of State  ] , Commerce , and Agriculture , we will work with [ORG MOTI  ] to help overcome the [ORG GOE  ] 's weak inter-ministerial cooperation by bring key [ORG GOE  ] stakeholders together to move forward on our main objectives . 
Where necessary , we will also offer technical assistance to [LOC Egypt  ] through existing [ORG USAID  ] , Patent and [ORG Trademark Office  ] ( [ORG PTO  ] ) and other [ORG USG  ] programs to support specific goals. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) We understand that [ORG USTR  ] Kirk is planning a visit to [LOC Cairo  ] in March for meetings . 
We recommend that [ORG USTR  ] Kirk use the visit to advance the goals outlined above in high-level meetings with the [ORG GOE  ] . 
Following his trip , we suggest that [ORG USTR  ] build on the momentum gained in our economic dialogue to send working-level experts and tap into existing [ORG USG  ] in-country officials to make progress on our key objectives with inter-ministerial [ORG GOE  ] decision-makers .
