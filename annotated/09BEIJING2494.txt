Reasons 1.4 ( b/d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: [LOC China  ] is biding its time until the political crisis in [LOC Iran  ] reaches a clearer resolution and the [MISC Ahmadinejad  ] government consolidates power , and will signal its renewed engagement by sending a high-level delegation to [LOC Tehran  ] once the political situation has been resolved , according to an [ORG MFA  ] official . 
Our contact reaffirmed [LOC China  ] 's commitment to the [LOC P5-plus-1  ] process and assessed that [LOC Iran  ] is attempting to keep the door to negotiation with the [LOC United States  ] open despite the turmoil surrounding the June election , but cautioned that a complete halt to uranium enrichment is an unattainable goal . 
[LOC China  ] continues to urge [LOC Iran  ] to respond positively to the [LOC P5-plus-1  ] offer for talks , and these entreaties have been passed directly to Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] . 
[LOC Iran  ] reportedly requested to upgrade its relationship with [LOC Beijing  ] to a " strategic partnership , " but [LOC China  ] refused . 
A [ORG Communist Party  ] official told us that the [ORG CCP  ] is seeking to increase its relations with six major political parties and factions in [LOC Iran  ] and deepen its understanding of [LOC U.S.  ] policy in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
He repeated [LOC China  ] 's standard position on the [LOC Iran  ] nuclear issue and suggested that the [LOC U.S.  ] offer economic incentives to persuade the [MISC Iranians  ] to enter into talks on the nuclear issue . 
He dismissed concerns that negative perceptions in the [LOC Middle East  ] of [LOC China  ] after the July violence in [LOC Xinjiang  ] province would affect [LOC China  ] 's diplomacy with [LOC Iran  ] . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG PolOff  ] discussed [MISC Iran-China  ] relations with [ORG MFA West Asian Affairs Department Iran Division  ] Deputy Director [PER Ni Ruchi  ] August 31 . 
In a separate meeting the same day , [ORG Chinese Communist Party  ] ( [ORG CCP  ] ) [ORG Central Committee International Liaison Department  ] ( [ORG CCID  ] ) [ORG Third Bureau  ] ( [LOC West Asia  ] and [LOC North Africa  ] ) Director [PER Wu Baocai  ] gave [ORG PolOff  ] the [ORG Party 's  ] perspective on [LOC Iran  ] and the nuclear issue . 
Holding Back Bilaterally until Political Dust Settles --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG MFA Iran Division  ] Deputy Director [PER Ni  ] said that the political turmoil in [LOC Iran  ] had yet to settle and that [LOC China  ] was still waiting for the situation to calm further before re-engaging fully in bilateral relations . 
He argued that the internal divisions that had played out in the June presidential elections had existed well before the violent aftermath of the June election . 
[LOC China  ] had been aware of the potential for conflict among those divisions to spill into the street and had taken a cautious approach before the election . 
He said that the [MISC Chinese  ] government understood that the election was a strong indication of deep-seated divisions within the [MISC Iranian  ] government , but stressed that the contested election had not fundamentally undermined the current government and that [LOC China  ] would continue with its normal engagement with [LOC Tehran.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [LOC China  ] would signal its re-engagement , [PER Ni  ] reported , with a high-level delegation to [LOC Tehran  ] , but there was no timetable for such a visit yet because the leadership in [LOC Tehran  ] was still fully focused on consolidating power . 
He noted that during his mid-August visit to [LOC Iran  ] , protestors had continued to take to the streets to express dissatisfaction with the election . 
[PER Ni  ] reaffirmed [LOC China  ] 's commitment to the [LOC P5-plus-1  ] process , stressing that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC China  ] not only had common interests in [LOC Iran  ] , but the scope of this common interest was increasing . 
[LOC Iran  ] Keeping the [MISC Door Open ?  ] --------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Ni  ] said that [LOC China  ] had taken note of efforts by the [MISC Iranian  ] government to keep a path open to direct negotiations despite the ongoing political turmoil . 
He claimed that [LOC Tehran  ] had refrained from overplaying its accusations of the [LOC U.S.  ] role in the election turmoil , preferring to point the finger at [MISC European  ] countries , indicating that the [MISC Iranian  ] leadership was interested in maintaining the possibility of direct talks . 
[PER Ni  ] said that the election had caused the [MISC Iranian  ] leadership to reexamine seriously its foreign policy , particularly on the nuclear issue , adding that [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear development had suffered technical setbacks recently , which had also forced the leadership to consider how to move forward . 
[ORG China Lobbying  ] but Total Halt to Enrichment Unattainable --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Ni  ] reported that [LOC China  ] continued to urge [LOC Iran  ] at every level of their engagement to respond positively to the P53-plus-1 offer of direct talks and cease uranium enrichment [LOC BEIJING  ] 00002494 002 OF 002 activities . 
He said that [MISC Chinese  ] leaders had pointed out to their [MISC Iranian  ] counterparts on many occasions that the [LOC United States  ] had shown " restraint " in its public comments during the June election aftermath , and that [LOC Iran  ] was missing an important opportunity by refusing to respond to the [LOC P5-plus-1  ] offer . 
[PER Ni  ] said that [LOC China  ] 's message encouraging greater engagement had been passed directly to Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] . 
He cautioned that [LOC Tehran  ] would not be able to respond positively to [LOC P5-plus-1  ] overtures until it had reinforced its position at home , and that a " 100-percent " halt to uranium enrichment had become an unattainable goal . 
[PER Ni  ] said that [LOC China  ] continued to believe that fresh sanctions would be ineffective in persuading [LOC Iran  ] to cease enrichment activities and would be counter-productive by increasing the unity of the various factions in [LOC Iran  ] behind the nuclear program and the current government . 
[PER Ni  ] argued that the regime in [LOC Iran  ] would emerge from the crisis in a weakened position and thus more likely to negotiate with the [LOC P5-plus-1  ] on the nuclear issue . 
[LOC Iran  ] Seeks " [ORG Strategic Partnership  ] " with an Unwilling [LOC PRC  ] --------------------------------------------- ----------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Ni  ] said that [LOC Iran  ] had requested that [LOC Beijing  ] upgrade its relationship with [LOC Tehran  ] , presumably to counter [MISC Western  ] pressure , by lobbying [LOC Beijing  ] to label its relationship with [LOC Iran  ] a " strategic partnership " as it does for [LOC Russia  ] and other countries . 
[PER Ni  ] said that [LOC China  ] had so far refused to do so and [LOC Iran  ] was frustrated with [LOC China  ] 's continuing insistence that the two countries shared merely " normal " relations . 
Party Seeks to Increase its Interaction with [LOC Iran  ] --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG CCP Central Committee International Liaison Department  ] ( [ORG CCID  ] ) [ORG Third Bureau  ] ( [LOC West Asia  ] and [LOC North Africa  ] ) Director [PER Wu Baocai  ] told [ORG PolOff  ] August 31 that the [ORG CCP  ] was seeking to increase its relations with six major political parties and factions in [LOC Iran  ] . 
He noted that links between the [ORG CCP  ] and [MISC Iranian  ] political parties had lagged behind the growth in relations between executive branches and far behind the increase in economic links . 
He said that deepening understanding among the [ORG CCP  ] leadership of the [LOC U.S.  ] position on [LOC Iran  ] was another emerging priority for his office and that he was open to continued exchanges with the [LOC U.S.  ] on the nuclear issue . 
[ORG CCP Perspective  ] on [ORG Iran Nuclear Program  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Wu  ] said that [ORG CCP  ] officials were increasingly concerned through 2008 at the possibility of the [LOC United States  ] taking military action against [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program but assessed that such a possibility was much lower in 2009 . 
He noted that sanctions had not only failed to change [MISC Iranian  ] behavior and create meaningful effects in [LOC Iran  ] but were negatively affecting the countries joining in the international effort to persuade [LOC Iran  ] to stop its nuclear activities , citing as an example constraints placed on [MISC Chinese  ] banks from doing business with [LOC Iran  ] . 
He said that he believed the international community was unlikely to be able to persuade [LOC Iran  ] to fully abandon its enrichment activities and suggested the [LOC U.S.  ] offer modest economic benefits as an incentive to persuade [LOC Iran  ] to enter into dialogue . 
[PER Wu  ] reiterated [LOC China  ] 's strong opposition to [LOC Iran  ] using its nuclear technology to develop nuclear weapons but stressed the right of all countries to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes . 
[LOC Iran  ] Relations Unaffected by [ORG Xinjiang Violence  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Wu  ] dismissed concerns that dismay in [LOC Iran  ] and other parts of the [LOC Middle East  ] over [LOC China  ] 's treatment of ethnic Uighurs in [LOC Xinjiang  ] province would complicate [LOC China  ] 's diplomacy with [LOC Iran  ] . 
While acknowledging that some high-level religious leaders in [LOC Iran  ] had been highly critical of [LOC China  ] in the wake of the July violence in [LOC Xinjiang  ] , he said that [LOC Beijing  ] was seeking to counter the danger of [LOC China  ] becoming a target for anger in the [MISC Muslim  ] world by significantly increasing its media outreach in the [LOC Middle East  ] , citing the recent establishment of an [MISC Arabic-language  ] version of government-run [ORG CCTV  ] .
