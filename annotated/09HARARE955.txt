[PER GAVIN STATE  ] PASS TO USAID FOR [PER J. HARMON AND L. DOBBINS EO  ] 12958 DECL: 12/09/2019 TAGS PREL , PGOV , ZI SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR PRESENTS CREDENTIALS TO [PER MUGABE  ] Classified By: Ambassador [PER Charles A. Ray  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) & ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador [PER Ray  ] presented his credentials to President [PER Robert Mugabe  ] today . 
The Ambassador was the fourth of four ambassadors to do so ( after [LOC Cuba  ] , [LOC Sudan  ] , and [LOC Ghana  ] ) and we were told there would be a 10-15 minute sit down after the presentation of credentials and photos . 
Instead , [PER Mugabe  ] , who was accompanied by Foreign Minister [PER Mumbengegwi  ] and [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs Permanent  ] Secretary [PER Bimha  ] , engaged the Ambassador in a 45-minute discussion ( mostly monologue ) at which tea and snacks were served. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) As customary , [PER Mugabe  ] immediately launched into his “history lesson , ” beginning with the revolutionary struggle for one man , one vote , continuing to the [LOC Lancaster House  ] agreement , proceeding to the betrayal of the [MISC British  ] in failing to fund land reform compensation , and ending with sanctions . 
He blamed [MISC British  ] policy on land reform on [MISC British  ] desires to keep their farmers on the land ; [MISC British  ] refusal to support land reform forced [LOC Zimbabwe  ] to proceed with land reform on its own , which then resulted in targeted sanctions . 
President [PER George W. Bush  ] , according to [PER Mugabe  ] , then imposed even harsher sanctions ( he mischaracterized [ORG ZDERA  ] as preventing [LOC U.S.  ] companies from doing business in [LOC Zimbabwe  ] ) than [LOC Britain  ] to reward Prime Minister [PER Tony Blair  ] for supporting him on [LOC Iraq.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Mugabe  ] averred that [LOC Zimbabwe  ] was democratic . 
Like anywhere , there may have been incidents of police misconduct , but there was no policy that resulted in human rights abuses . 
He added that , despite the ( necessary ) land reform program , not all land had been seized . 
Commercial tea and sugar estates still existed , as well as wild life conservancies . 
No business investments had been indigenized or nationalized. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During a pause in the monologue , Ambassador [PER Ray  ] broke in . 
He noted the spirit of friendship which had been extended to him by [MISC Zimbabweans  ] ( to which [PER Mugabe  ] quipped that [MISC Zimbabweans  ] remained friendly despite the imposition of sanctions ) . 
The Ambassador said he sought cooperation rather than confrontation and that he was committed to helping [LOC Zimbabwe  ] regain its status as the “jewel of [MISC Africa.”  ] He wished to listen , not lecture . 
But to move forward , it was necessary for everyone to play by the rules . 
The Ambassador concluded that the future of [LOC Zimbabwe  ] was up to the [MISC Zimbabwean  ] people. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Mugabe  ] responded that he would not visit “the sins” of the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] predecessors on the Ambassador . 
He hoped the Ambassador was extending an olive branch ; he expected better relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] Without referring to him by name , he accused Ambassador [PER McGee  ] , the previous [LOC U.S.  ] ambassador , and the [LOC U.S.  ] government , of having sought regime change ; and charged that [PER McGee  ] had supported the opposition and become the right-hand man of the opposition. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Mugabe  ] appears unchanged from several conversations we have had with him over the last couple of years . 
He is fixated on land reform and sanctions , and is almost trance-like ( monologue , soft voice ) in discussing these subjects . 
But he is generally alert and can keep up with a conversation . 
Physically , [PER Mugabe  ] is frail He appears uncomfortable when seated -- he slouches and frequently turns his body as if to find a better position , and then sits straight up and speaks in a louder voice for a few seconds before lapsing back into the barely audible soft voice . 
END COMMENT .
