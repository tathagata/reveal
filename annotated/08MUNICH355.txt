( [ORG SBU  ] ) Newly-elected [MISC Bavarian  ] Minister-President [PER Horst Seehofer  ] ( [ORG Christian Social Union  ] - [ORG CSU  ] ) elevated youthful , female , and fresh faces in the presentation of his surprising cabinet choices on October 30 . 
In a canny move , he also chose 36-year-old [ORG Bundestag  ] member [ORG Karl-Theodor  ] zu [PER Guttenberg  ] as [ORG CSU  ] Secretary General . 
This makes zu [PER Guttenberg  ] effectively the spokesman , television personality , and advisor to the [ORG CSU  ] leadership . 
He is also a [LOC Berlin  ] player , serving as the [ORG CSU  ] 's main foreign policy expert and member of the [ORG Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee  ] . 
( Note: While zu [PER Guttenberg  ] likely will choose to retain his [ORG Bundestag  ] seat , his office at [ORG CSU  ] headquarters in [LOC Munich  ] told us said it is not clear whether he will remain on the [ORG Foreign Affairs Committee  ] or switch to a committee oriented toward domestic affairs . 
End note . 
) [PER Seehofer  ] 's choice underlines the [ORG CSU  ] 's claim to be more than just a regional party , particularly in view of the 2009 [MISC European  ] Parliament and federal elections . 
The group ( para 4 below ) needs to appeal to skeptical citizenry if the [ORG CSU  ] hopes to do better in [MISC European  ] and [ORG Bundestag  ] elections in 2009. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Complicating [PER Seehofer  ] 's and the new cabinet 's task is the new presence of three members of the coalition member [ORG Free Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) ( one is a State Secretary ) , who will make their own attempts to strike a favorable profile . 
In all , [PER Seehofer  ] replaced sixteen of the eighteen cabinet positions with eight newcomers . 
He could be accused of ageism since he dismissed all [ORG CSU  ] cabinet members over 60 years old , thus drastically reducing the government 's age average below 50 . 
Five cabinet members are women . 
Notably , the [ORG Landtag  ] also elected its first female President , the 64-year-old [PER Barbara Stamm.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The new [MISC Bavarian  ] cabinet will consist of the following members , all [ORG CSU  ] unless otherwise noted as FDP: -Minister President: [PER Horst Seehofer  ] , 59 , [LOC Upper Bavaria  ] , elected on October 27 ( new ) ; -Minister of [MISC Economics  ] and Deputy Minister President: [PER Martin Zeil  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) , 52 , [LOC Upper Bavaria  ] ( new ) ; --MOE State Secretary: [PER Katja Hessel  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) , 36 , [LOC Middle Franconia  ] ( new ) ; -Minister of [ORG Interior: Joachim Herrmann  ] , 52 , [LOC Middle Franconia  ] ( the incumbent ) ; -MOI State Secretary: [PER Bernd Weiss  ] , 40 , [LOC Lower Franconia  ] ( new ) ; -Minister for Labor and [ORG Social Affairs:  ] [PER Christine Haderthauer  ] , 47 , [LOC Upper Bavaria  ] ( new , formerly General Secretary of the [ORG CSU  ] ) ; --State Secretary: [PER Markus Sackmann  ] , 47 , [LOC Upper Palatinate  ] ( new ) ; -Minister at the [MISC Bavarian  ] State [PER Chancery: Siegfried Schneider  ] , 52 , [LOC Upper Bavaria  ] ( new ) ; -Minister for [MISC European  ] and [ORG Federal Affairs:  ] [PER Emilia Mueller  ] , 56 , [LOC Upper Palatinate  ] ( new ) ; -Minister of [ORG Finance:  ] [PER Georg Fahrenschon  ] , 40 , [LOC Upper Bavaria  ] ( new ) ; --MOF State Secretary: [PER Franz Josef Pschierer  ] , 52 , [PER Suabia  ] ( new ) ; -Minister of [MISC Environment:  ] [PER Markus Soeder  ] , 41 , [LOC Middle Franconia  ] ( new ) ; --MOEnv State Secretary: [PER Melanie Huml  ] , 33 , [LOC Upper Franconia  ] ( new ) ; -Minister of Agriculture: [PER Helmut Brunner  ] , 54 , [LOC Lower Bavaria  ] ( new ) ; -Minister of Justice: Dr. [PER Beate Merk  ] , 51 , [PER Suabia  ] ; -Minister of Science: Dr. [PER Wolfgang Heubisch  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) , 62 , [LOC Upper Bavaria  ] ( new ) ; -Minister of Culture and [MISC Education:  ] [PER Ludwig Spaenle  ] , 47 , [LOC Upper Bavaria  ] ; --MOC&Ed State Secretary: Dr. [PER Marcel Huber  ] , 50 , [LOC Upper Bavaria  ] ( new ) .

( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: [PER Seehofer  ] 's cabinet is mainly remarkable for its youthful representation . 
We view the surprise nomination of [ORG Karl-Theodor  ] zu [PER Guttenberg  ] as Secretary General as a clever move , particularly in view of the [ORG CSU  ] 's claim of being more than just a regional [MISC Bavarian  ] party . 
[PER Zu Guttenberg  ] is a foreign policy expert , a transatlanticist and a close and well-known friend to the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Mission Germany.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 .
