THE HAGUE 663 Classified By: Pol Deputy [PER Eric G. Falls  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S/NF ) SUMMARY: [MISC Dutch  ] Defense Minister [PER van Middelkoop  ] and the leader of the largest coalition party in parliament told Ambassador they expected the Government to find a way to stay in [LOC Afghanistan  ] after 2010 , albeit with a significantly reduced presence . 
Press coverage of the President 's address was broad , with [ORG Cabinet  ] members avoiding comment on the [MISC Dutch  ] deployment decision . 
The Ambassador will see other key figures in the coming days . 
The PM 's office recommends against high-profile [ORG USG  ] visits at this time , and Post concurs . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) DEFENSE MINISTER: Defense Minister [PER Eimert Van Middelkoop  ] told Ambassador it was important that President [PER Obama  ] used the term " " transition " " as a means of explaining the way forward in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , which sent the proper signal to allies and [MISC Afghans  ] . 
( NOTE: [PER Van Middelkoop  ] is a member of the [ORG Christian Union  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] governing coalition is made up of the [MISC Christian Democrats  ] , [ORG Labor  ] , and the [ORG Christian Union  ] . 
END NOTE . 
) He said the new [LOC U.S.  ] strategy was very much in alignment with [MISC Dutch  ] operational activity in [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
Throughout the conversation , van [PER Middelkoop  ] referred to the [ORG Cabinet  ] discussion on [LOC Afghanistan  ] as " " frustrating " " and alluded to the intransigence of the [ORG Labor Party  ] . 
He indicated they would try to reframe the discussions on transforming the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG PRT  ] in [LOC Uruzgan  ] as a multi-national [ORG PRT  ] , still led by the [MISC Dutch  ] and with force protection . 
Asked about a potential cabinet crisis on the [LOC Afghanistan  ] question , [PER Van Middelkoop  ] confirmed that the [ORG Labor Party  ] has been very slow to talk about any possibilities in [LOC Uruzgan  ] and has not left much room for alternatives . 
He said the [MISC Dutch  ] will not/not leave [LOC Afghanistan  ] and will commit other resources to the mission . 
The only open question really is the continuation of a [ORG PRT  ] in [LOC Uruzgan.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) [MISC CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS  ] FLOORLEADER: [PER Pieter van Geel  ] , leader of the largest party in parliament , the [MISC Christian Democrats  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) , told Ambassador he was " " convinced " " the government coalition would not leave [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and would stay " " somehow . 
" " He assured the Ambassador that PM [PER Balkenende  ] and FM [PER Verhagen  ] continue to support the mission , and that PM [PER Balkenende  ] understands that the [MISC Dutch  ] military needs a political decision by [MISC Christmas  ] for planning purposes . 
[PER Van Geel  ] agreed that the [MISC Netherlands'  ] leadership position in [LOC Europe  ] would be harmed if it failed to contribute to the [ORG NATO  ] effort . 
However , [PER Van Geel  ] said some coalition members in parliament cling to " " irrational " " views , such as that the government promised to end its [LOC Afghanistan  ] deployment after <a id='par2010' href='#par2010'>¶</a>2010 . 
[ORG Labor  ] confronts the rational pressure from NGOs to stay on and preserve the gains the [MISC Dutch  ] had won in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , with the irrational commitment to get out of [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
[PER Van Geel  ] had hoped that the election of President [PER Obama  ] and his new approach in [LOC Afghanistan  ] would sway [ORG Labor Party  ] members , but he has been disappointed . 
Unlike the [MISC Christian Democrats  ] , the [ORG Labor Party  ] does not have a history of making tough political decisions . 
Within [MISC Dutch  ] society , despite satisfaction with the government , there has been a growing a fear of globalization , skepticism of development aid , and a Qfear of globalization , skepticism of development aid , and a tendency to &hide behind the dikes8 rather than fully engage with the outside world . 
Asked about helpful efforts to engage the [MISC Dutch  ] , [PER Van Geel  ] said General [PER Petraeus  ] 's full praise for the [MISC Dutch  ] efforts during his September visit was a pleasant surprise -- parliamentarians had expected criticism . 
He noted that opposition parties were important to developing sufficient support for continued deployment , and therefore [PER Mark Rutte  ] of the [ORG Liberal Party  ] ( [ORG VVD  ] ) and [PER Alexander Pechtold  ] of [ORG D66  ] would be important contacts for the [ORG USG  ] . 
The [ORG CDA  ] had found it helpful to bring former members of [MISC Dutch  ] government to parliament , where they offered less political arguments for staying. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( SBU ) PRESS COVERAGE: The president 's speech -- including positive reactions from key [MISC Dutch  ] cabinet members -- garnered widespread coverage throughout the country on December 2 . 
It was the lead story on the early morning TV and radio news programs . 
Although too late to make the morning papers , it was covered thoroughly on the websites of the major dailies , including links to a video and the full text of the speech . 
The headline of the nation 's largest daily , " " [ORG De Telegraaf  ] , " " read " " Heavy [LOC U.S.  ] Pressure on [MISC Dutch  ] Government: Stay in THE HAGUE 00000726 002 OF 002 [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
" " Various press outlets reported that Secretary [PER Clinton  ] called Foreign Minister [PER Verhagen  ] ( a [ORG CDA  ] member ) last week , asking the [LOC Netherlands  ] to " " reconsider " " its planned troop withdrawal . 
They also reported that Undersecretary of Defense [PER Flournoy  ] called Defense Minister [PER Van Middelkoop  ] with the same request . 
Although he declined to speculate on the [ORG Cabinet  ] 's upcoming decision , FM [PER Verhagen  ] commended the president 's speech , adding that " " If everyone were to say 'let others take care of this , ' [LOC Afghanistan  ] would again be a free haven for terrorists in no time . 
The [LOC Netherlands  ] cannot just pass the care for security in [LOC Afghanistan  ] to others . 
" " [PER Van Middelkoop  ] similarly praised what he called the President 's " " clear and recognizable vision " " for the mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , including the deadline of July 2011 to begin withdrawing [LOC U.S.  ] forces and his call on [ORG NATO  ] allies to provide more military troops . 
Like [PER Verhagen  ] , though , [PER Van Middelkoop  ] stressed that the [MISC Dutch  ] government has made no decision about its military contributions after August 1 , <a id='par2010' href='#par2010'>¶</a>2010 . 
[ORG Labor Party  ] spokesman [PER Martijn van Dam  ] said his party will continue to oppose retaining troops in [LOC Uruzgan.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) OTHER REACTIONS: -- [ORG National Security Adviser  ] Karel van [PER Oosterom  ] said that negotiations in coalition are moving " " inch by inch " " and are delicate . 
" " We are beginning to move [ORG Labor  ] . 
" " He advised against high-profile [LOC U.S.  ] engagement , asserting it would be counterproductive at this time . 
[MISC Dutch  ] [ORG NATO  ] PermRep Ambassador Majoor intends to speak soon with Ambassador [PER Daalder  ] . 
On December 3 , the [MISC Dutch  ] Chief of Defense , General [PER Van Uhm  ] , will speak with the [ORG CJCS Admiral Mullen  ] and [ORG SACEUR Admiral  ] Stavridis . 
-- The [MISC Slovak  ] ambassador to the [LOC Netherlands  ] had high praise for the [MISC Dutch  ] , telling the [MISC Dutch  ] MOD political director during a reception that her nations' troops would be eager to expand their work with the [MISC Dutch  ] in [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
-- [MISC Dutch  ] Ambassador to the [LOC United States  ] Jones-Bos told [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador she was willing to help as needed and that she was " " working " " [MISC Transportation Ministers Eurlings  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) and State Secretary for [ORG European Affairs Timmermans  ] ( [ORG Labor  ] ) to encourage coalition support for a longer-term [LOC Uruzgan  ] commitment. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) NEXT STEPS: Post will place an op-ed by Ambassador [PER Daalder  ] , and [ORG NATO  ] SYG Rasmussen is also submitting a piece to the [MISC Dutch  ] press . 
Ambassador will see the following key figures in the next few weeks: -- Dec. 4 -- Development Minister [PER Koenders  ] , a key decision-maker in the [ORG Labor Party  ] -- Dec. 7 -- FM [PER Verhagen  ] and the head of parliament 's defense committee , [PER Anouchka van Miltenberg  ] . 
-- Dec. 14 -- Opposition party leader [PER Mark Rutte  ] , of the [ORG Liberal Party  ] , a possible proponent of the mission . 
-- Dec. 15 -- Head of parliament 's foreign affairs committee , [PER Henk Jan Ormel.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) COMMENT: The PM 's office recommends against high-profile [ORG USG  ] visits at this time , and [ORG Post  ] concurs . 
Our central goal is to convince the [LOC Netherlands  ] to maintain after 2010 a PRT in [LOC Uruzgan  ] with a few hundred troops for force protection . 
We expect them to withdraw nearly 1500 troops in 2010 while continuing their support with [MISC F-16s  ] , enablers , and military and police training . 
The upcoming meeting with Minister [PER Koenders  ] , just after the [MISC Dutch  ] cabinet meets on Friday , will be particularly informative . 
A [LOC U.S.  ] QFriday , will be particularly informative . 
A [LOC U.S.  ] announcement on who will take over [ORG Task Force Uruzgan  ] will help us engage the [MISC Dutch  ] to sustain their efforts in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
END COMMENT .
