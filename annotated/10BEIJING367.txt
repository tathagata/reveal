Reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC African  ] Embassy officials told [ORG EmbOffs  ] that many in the [MISC African  ] community were uncomfortable with the concept of [MISC US-China  ] development cooperation in [LOC Africa  ] . 
[ORG China’s  ] fast , efficient , “no strings attached” bilateral approach is popular in the region , as is the [LOC PRC  ] preference for infrastructure over governance projects . 
[MISC African  ] officials fear that [LOC U.S.  ] or [MISC European  ] interference will slow down the assistance process and tie conditions to [MISC Chinese  ] aid . 
In the past , the [ORG EU  ] angered many [MISC African  ] countries when it proposed trilateral cooperation . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] subsequently backed out of discussions citing lack of [MISC African  ] support . 
In addition , [MISC African  ] officials believe that competition between donors has had positive consequences for [MISC African  ] development , giving the [MISC African  ] countries options after several decades of a largely “Western” development model . 
Despite apprehensions , one official believed that [MISC U.S.-China  ] cooperation could be positive if carried out with active [MISC African  ] participation . 
The [ORG UK’s Department for International Development  ] ( [ORG DFID  ] ) was offered as an example of an organization that has managed to collaborate well with [LOC China  ] in [LOC Africa  ] . 
End summary . 
Threatening the [MISC Chinese  ] way ---------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) During a February 8 lunch , [MISC Kenyan  ] Ambassador to [LOC China  ] Julius [PER Ole Sunkuli  ] said he and other [MISC Africans  ] were wary of the [MISC U.S.-China  ] dialogue on [LOC Africa  ] and felt [LOC Africa  ] had nothing to gain from [LOC China  ] cooperating with the international donor community . 
[PER Sunkuli  ] claimed that [LOC Africa  ] was better off thanks to [ORG China’s  ] practical , bilateral approach to development assistance and was concerned that this would be changed by “Western” interference . 
He said he saw no concrete benefit for [LOC Africa  ] in even minimal cooperation . 
[PER Sunkuli  ] said [MISC Africans  ] were frustrated by [MISC Western  ] insistence on capacity building , which translated , in his eyes , into conferences and seminars ( [ORG REF  ] C ) . 
They instead preferred [ORG China’s  ] focus on infrastructure and tangible projects . 
He also worried that [LOC Africa  ] would lose the benefit of having some leverage to negotiate with their donors if their development partners joined forces . 
Lessons from the [ORG EU  ] experience ------------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC South African  ] Minister [PER Plenipotentiary Dave Malcolmson  ] echoed the same reservations in a February 9 meeting . 
According to him , lessons could be learned from the [ORG EU  ] experience in 2008 . 
When the [ORG EU  ] put together a policy paper on trilateral development cooperation in [LOC Africa  ] , many [MISC African  ] countries were annoyed because they were not consulted on the issue . 
They argued that the third party in these nominally trilateral discussions was conspicuously absent . 
They perceived this as a [MISC Western  ] attempt to reign in [LOC China’s Africa  ] assistance . 
[PER Malcolmson  ] said the [MISC African  ] resistance prevented any concrete progress coming out of this initiative as the [MISC Chinese  ] then subsequently backed out of the discussion , citing [MISC African  ] opposition . 
[MISC Africans  ] don’t want conditions , they want options --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [MISC African  ] countries principally fear that the [LOC U.S.  ] and other [MISC Western  ] countries will use trilateral cooperation to try to attach governance conditions to [MISC Chinese  ] development . 
[PER Malcolmson  ] , who previously worked at the [ORG New Partnership for African Development  ] ( [ORG NEPAD  ] ) secretariat , recalled that governance projects received a lot more support from [LOC BEIJING  ] 00000367 002 OF 002 [MISC Western  ] donor countries than infrastructure projects . 
He opined that although governance , peace and security are crucial to [MISC African  ] growth , they must be accompanied by measures to reduce poverty and build infrastructure. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Malcolmson  ] echoed Sunkuli’s comment that [MISC African  ] countries also fear losing their bargaining power . 
[ORG China’s  ] emergence in [LOC Africa  ] as a counterbalance to [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC European  ] donors has been very positive for [LOC Africa  ] by creating “competition” and giving [MISC African  ] countries options . 
He recalled that after the 2006 Forum on [MISC China-Africa Cooperation  ] ( [ORG FOCAC  ] ) summit , when [LOC China  ] announced its commitments to [LOC Africa  ] to much international media fanfare , traditional donors changed their attitude . 
They recognized that they had to measure up to [LOC China  ] and “came calling.” The [ORG EU  ] proposed infrastructure projects ( after having defacto given up supporting these types of projects ) and the [ORG World Bank  ] began to support more agriculture projects . 
The [ORG DFID  ] example and recommendations for the future --------------------------------------------- ------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Malcolmson  ] clarified that if [MISC U.S.-China  ] cooperation leads to a real escalation of resources then it could be a positive step , but many [MISC Africans  ] expect that it would slow down development . 
He cited the DFID’s relationship with [LOC China  ] as an example of healthy cooperation . 
DFID’s success has come from focusing on small projects and working largely outside formal channels ( [ORG REF  ] A ) . 
[PER Malcolmson  ] recommended working through regional [MISC African  ] organizations like the [MISC Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development  ] Programme ( [ORG CAADP  ] ) as a way to alleviate [MISC African  ] concerns . 
If both [LOC China  ] and the [LOC United States  ] contribute resources to promising [MISC African  ] development projects , then [MISC Africans  ] will welcome trilateral cooperation . 
He said this would have the added benefit of encouraging the [MISC Chinese  ] to venture beyond bilateral development assistance and support regional projects . 
Comment -------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Sunkuli  ] and Malcolmson’s comments are a potential warning sign as the [ORG USG  ] prepares for the upcoming [MISC U.S.-China  ] Sub-Dialogue on [LOC Africa  ] . 
As the [LOC PRC  ] continues to stress a policy of “non- interference” in the internal affairs of other countries , [LOC China  ] could well use any voiced [MISC African  ] opposition as an excuse to stop or slow progress on further discussions or collaboration . 
We should be careful to pick projects that would have broad support within the [MISC African  ] community , preferably [MISC African-initiated  ] and led , to get the development cooperation dialogue started on the right foot . 
In addition , we should clearly articulate the benefits of our cooperation to our [MISC African  ] counterparts and include [MISC African  ] voices in the debate on the [MISC U.S.- China-Africa  ] relationship .
