[ORG EMBASSY PARIS DAILY SIPRNET REPORTS Classified  ] By: Ambassador [PER Craig Stapleton  ] for reasons 1.4 ( B & D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: Foreign policy played only a negligible role in the presidential election campaign that concluded May 6 , and [PER Sarkozy  ] has relatively little experience in foreign affairs , despite his tenures as Interior and Finance Minister . 
Nonetheless , [PER Sarkozy  ] 's personality is such that he will want to take the stage at the June 6-8 G8 and June 21-22 [MISC European  ] summits as a full partner . 
Instinctively pro-American and pro-Israeli , [PER Sarkozy  ] is fiercely opposed to [MISC Turkish  ] [ORG EU  ] membership . 
He has promised that his approach to foreign affairs will be different from [ORG Chirac  ] 's in its emphasis on human rights , and has identified [LOC Europe  ] , [LOC Africa  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] as his three immediate priorities . 
That said , generally speaking , continuity will prevail , reflecting the non-partisan , consensus support that [MISC French  ] foreign policy has enjoyed during the [LOC Fifth Republic  ] . 
On [LOC Europe  ] , his goal is , by overcoming the current institutional crisis , to re-impart momentum to [MISC European  ] integration and make the [ORG EU  ] a major player on the world stage . 
On [LOC Africa  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] advocates increased developmental aid as the offset for regulating immigration ( important for his domestic agenda ) and has repeatedly called for action on [LOC Darfur  ] . 
He has called for a " [ORG Mediterranean Union  ] , " to include [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Israel  ] , as [LOC Europe  ] 's institutional link to the [LOC Middle East  ] and [LOC North Africa  ] . 
With the [LOC U.S.  ] , he seeks a relationship based on renewed confidence and trust that still allows for honest differences of perspective ; most recently , he has pointed to global climate change ( septel ) as his major area of policy difference with the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) SUMMARY CONT'D: The Deputy Secretary 's May 16 meetings in [LOC Paris  ] will occur the same day President-elect [PER Sarkozy  ] assumes office ( [PER Sarkozy  ] himself will therefore be unavailable ) . 
Beyond welcoming the prospect of improved [MISC U.S.-French  ] relations , the Deputy Secretary can use his visit to send a message on five key [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy concerns . 
We can welcome [PER Sarkozy  ] 's willingness to take a tough line on [LOC Iran  ] , but also will need to impress on him the stakes in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and the importance of [LOC France  ] remaining a key partner there . 
On [LOC Iraq  ] , we can expect [PER Sarkozy  ] to drop the needling rhetoric on a horizon for [LOC U.S.  ] withdrawal , but having told the President he " wants to help the [LOC U.S.  ] get out of [LOC Iraq  ] , " we should press him to offer a specific , symbolic proposal -- such as active [MISC French  ] engagement with friendly [MISC Arab  ] governments -- to associate [LOC France  ] with our efforts there . 
In assuring [PER Sarkozy  ] of strong [LOC U.S.  ] support for a strong [LOC Europe  ] , we need to stress the importance we attach to keeping [LOC Turkey  ] 's [ORG EU  ] accession negotiations going . 
Finally , we should stress the importance of a united front against [LOC Russia  ] as [LOC Kosovo  ] goes before the [ORG UNSC  ] . 
END SUMMARY . 
A NOVICE IN FOREIGN POLICY -------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) A presidential election campaign dominated by the domestic change and reform thematic left very little room for foreign policy . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has little foreign policy experience and speaks only very limited [MISC English  ] . 
Given his strong character and action-oriented agenda , and his desire to put [LOC France  ] back on center stage , we can nonetheless expect [PER Sarkozy  ] to move quickly to assert himself as an equal partner at the upcoming June 6-8 G8 [LOC Summit  ] in [LOC Germany  ] and the June 21-22 [ORG European Council  ] meeting in [LOC Brussels  ] . 
( See ref A for a discussion of [PER Sarkozy  ] 's views on economic and trade issues . 
) U.S.-FRIENDLIER , BUT STILL A GAULLIST ------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Most voters went to the polls May 6 convinced that President-elect [PER Sarkozy  ] would seek a better relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] , which he explicitly affirmed in his May 6 acceptance speech . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] 's opponents had attempted to use his September 12 , 2006 meeting with President [PER Bush  ] to suggest that [PER Sarkozy  ] was a [LOC U.S  ] . 
" poodle " who would have supported the [LOC U.S.  ] intervention in [LOC Iraq  ] , unlike President [ORG Chirac  ] . 
In a recent press conference on foreign policy ( ref B ) , [PER Sarkozy  ] made clear he had supported [ORG Chirac  ] 's decision . 
Then and in his post-election remarks , he nonetheless highlighted the need for a friendlier tone and more confidence in the [MISC U.S.-French  ] bilateral relationship ( and in [MISC NATO-EU  ] relations ) , in a way that also preserves Gaullist ( and [ORG EU  ] ) freedom of action . 
In effect , [PER Sarkozy  ] has already shifted [LOC PARIS  ] 00001844 002 OF 004 the focus of [MISC U.S.-French  ] " differences " from [LOC Iraq  ] and the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] relationship to climate change and [MISC Turkish  ] membership in the [ORG EU  ] ( see also refs B , C and D ) . 
[ORG EU  ] TOP IMMEDIATE PRIORITY ------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] 's first foreign policy priority will be to impart new momentum to the [ORG EU  ] and show that [LOC France  ] is back as a key [ORG EU  ] player . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] no doubt knows already that his idea of a simplified treaty is acceptable to [LOC London  ] and [LOC Berlin  ] as the best means to avoid new referenda , and he will move quickly to ensure that a process can begin by the end of the [MISC German  ] [ORG EU  ] Presidency that would conclude at the latest by the end of the [MISC French  ] Presidency in December 2008 , in advance of [MISC European  ] parliamentary elections in early 2009 . 
Immediate progress on this front would go a long way to overcome the sense of malaise and indirection stemming from President [ORG Chirac  ] 's failure to push through the referendum on the [ORG Constitutional Treaty  ] in May 2005 . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] wants a [ORG European Union  ] that is a veritable player on the world stage , with coherent policies to guarantee its energy supplies and create buffers against globalization while harnessing its creative energies . 
[MISC AFRICAN  ] DEVELOPMENT AND [LOC DARFUR  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( c ) [PER Sarkozy  ] lacks the web of personal relationships with [MISC African  ] ( and [LOC Middle Eastern  ] ) leaders that , in particular , [ORG Chirac  ] used to direct [MISC French  ] foreign policy . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] intends to make a virtue of his less personalized approach , reviewing [LOC France  ] 's exposure based on a hard-headed re-evaluation of [MISC French  ] national interests . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has identified [LOC Africa  ] as one of his three foreign policy priority areas ( along with the [ORG EU  ] and [LOC U.S  ] . 
) , in line with his domestic campaign focus on uncontrolled immigration to [LOC France  ] . 
His interest in development assistance for [LOC Africa  ] appears aimed primarily at offsetting [MISC Africans'  ] concern over [PER Sarkozy  ] 's domestic political goal of reducing immigration from [LOC Africa  ] -- and as part of a more comprehensive international effort to address conditions in [LOC Africa  ] that give rise to mass emigration from the continent . 
A review of [MISC French  ] national interests may augur a lessening of [MISC French  ] military engagement across [LOC Africa  ] or an increased desire to see the [ORG EU  ] take over some of its missions . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has called repeatedly for action on [ORG Darfur  ] , including prosecution of [MISC Sudanese  ] leaders by the [ORG International Criminal Court  ] , but it is unclear at this stage what concrete steps he might otherwise propose . 
[ORG MEDITERRANEAN UNION  ] AND THE [LOC MIDDLE EAST  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) We can expect [PER Sarkozy  ] to push hard his signature " vision " issue , the idea of a " [ORG Mediterranean Union  ] , " to include [LOC Turkey  ] and [LOC Israel  ] , which would supersede the [ORG EU  ] Barcelona process and create an area modeled after , and having a privileged partnership with , the [ORG European Union  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has bluntly declared that pursuing [LOC Middle East  ] peace is not incompatible with ensuring [LOC Israel  ] 's security , while assuring nervous [MISC Arab  ] leaders -- most recently [MISC Egyptian  ] President [PER Mubarak  ] -- that his policies toward the [LOC Middle East  ] would be largely in synch with [ORG Chirac  ] 's . 
On the whole , it seems likely that continuity will prevail , although the traditionally pro-Arab MFA may have to accommodate [PER Sarkozy  ] 's greater emphasis on [LOC Israel  ] 's security needs . 
It remains to be seen to what extent [PER Sarkozy  ] will attempt to leverage his pro-Israel orientation for more leverage for [LOC France  ] and/or the [ORG EU  ] in the [LOC Middle East  ] peace process . 
MORE HUMAN RIGHTS ----------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] has indicated very publicly -- enough so that it is reasonable to assume that he will follow through -- that he intends to place more emphasis on human rights issues . 
He has made clear that he would be less likely than [ORG Chirac  ] to accommodate even [LOC Russia  ] or [LOC China  ] in the name of realpolitik , citing the situation in [LOC Chechnya  ] and his opposition to lifting of the [ORG EU  ] arms embargo on [LOC China  ] . 
A consistent emphasis on human rights could have a significant impact on [MISC French  ] policy in [LOC Africa  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
IMMEDIATE MESSAGES: [LOC IRAN  ] , [LOC IRAQ  ] , [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] , [LOC EU/TURKEY  ] , [LOC KOSOVO/RUSSIA  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) We believe that , beginning with the May 15-16 visit to [LOC France  ] of the Deputy Secretary , the [ORG USG  ] should reach out quickly to engage the new [MISC French  ] government . 
Beyond welcoming prospects for an improved [MISC U.S.-French  ] relationship , we need to send messages on the following five key issues: [LOC PARIS  ] 00001844 003 OF 004 [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC EU/Turkey  ] , and [LOC Kosovo/Russia  ] . 
If time permits , the Deputy Secretary may also wish to review the state of play on [ORG Darfur  ] . 
-- [PER IRAN: Sarkozy  ] views [LOC Iran  ] as the most serious international threat , and he will be at least as tough-minded a partner as [ORG Chirac  ] has been . 
He has expressed a willingness to tighten financial sanctions against [LOC Iran  ] . 
While he prefers acting under the authority of the [ORG UNSC  ] , we believe he could support resorting to measures outside the [ORG UN  ] framework if necessary . 
The late-May consideration of next steps in the [ORG UNSC  ] offers a first opportunity to work with the new government , and to test and shape its approach . 
-- AFGHANISTAN: MFA Political Director [PER Araud  ] has underscored the need for the [ORG USG  ] to engage the new government to dispel the widespread impression , shared by [ORG Chirac  ] , that [LOC Afghanistan  ] may be a losing cause . 
Under the impact of the [ORG Taliban  ] kidnapping of [MISC French  ] citizens , [PER Sarkozy  ] recently stated that [LOC France  ] 's role in [LOC Afghanistan  ] -- now that the anti-terrorism campaign has largely ended and [MISC French  ] Special Forces withdrawn from [LOC OEF  ] -- was no longer " decisive " and that [MISC French  ] forces would not remain there permanently . 
The [ORG Taliban  ] threat against the life of the one remaining [MISC French  ] hostage is still directly tied to a demand for [LOC France  ] 's military withdrawal form [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
We will need to impress on [PER Sarkozy  ] the importance of [MISC French  ] perseverance over the mid-term ( including through more purposeful public statements about the stakes there ) and , as the [MISC French  ] have stressed to us on [LOC Bosnia  ] or [LOC Kosovo  ] , the importance of " in together and out together , " which also applies to national caveats on the use of forces . 
-- IRAQ: [ORG Chirac  ] 's departure from the scene should enable [LOC France  ] to put [MISC U.S.-French  ] differences not only aside , but behind us . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] , like most other [MISC French  ] politicians , has said he would have handled our differences in a less confrontational matter . 
This does not change the fact that he ( now , in any case ) believes [ORG Chirac  ] made the right decision in opposing the war . 
Moreover , concern about feeding the " President [PER Bush  ] 's poodle " accusation might militate against any dramatic public change in [LOC GOF  ] policy , at least in the immediate future , with [MISC French  ] parliamentary elections looming . 
That said , we should take him at his word that he " wants to help the [LOC U.S.  ] get out of [LOC Iraq  ] . 
" Our goal in the near term should be to push the [MISC French  ] toward a more positive declaratory policy , working with the new government to identify a symbolic turning of the page on [LOC France  ] 's " let the [LOC U.S.  ] live with it " attitude of the [LOC Chirac/Villepin  ] years . 
One possibility would be active [MISC French  ] engagement on [LOC Iraq  ] with [MISC Arab  ] governments of the region . 
-- [ORG EU/TURKEY: Publicly  ] and privately , we should encourage [LOC France  ] to reassume its rightful place in [LOC Europe  ] , as part of our broader message that a re-invigorated [LOC Europe  ] is in the [LOC U.S.  ] interest . 
If we decide to participate in an [MISC ESDP  ] police mission in [LOC Kosovo  ] , we should use this as an example -- one for them to follow -- of choosing the institutional framework for joint action to match the needs of the situation . 
[PER Luc Ferry  ] , a former Education Minister , political commentator and close friend of [PER Sarkozy  ] 's , has urged that we attempt to change [PER Sarkozy  ] 's opposition to [LOC Turkey  ] 's [ORG EU  ] membership . 
While a change of heart appears extremely unlikely given [PER Sarkozy  ] 's political identification with opposition to [MISC Turkish  ] membership and his categorical statements on the issue , we should seek to persuade him to temper his post-election rhetoric , allow accession negotiations to proceed , and at least not close the door dramatically and completely at this time . 
-- KOSOVO/RUSSIA: We should stress the importance of a united front in the [ORG UN Security Council  ] on [LOC Kosovo  ] 's independence . 
We would welcome a more active [MISC French  ] role in persuading [LOC Russia  ] not to veto a [ORG UNSC Resolution  ] . 
ENGAGING THE [PER SARKOZY  ] ADMINISTRATION ----------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) We will know more about the likely foreign policy orientations of the new [PER Sarkozy  ] government once he names a foreign minister and key advisors are in place . 
We would expect him to designate someone of proven competence ( such as former FM [PER Alain Juppe  ] , Defense Minister [PER Michele Alliot-Marie  ] , or former FM [PER Michel Barnier  ] ) . 
There is no reason to believe that [PER Sarkozy  ] will come into office with the intent of seriously challenging the Gaullist consensus underlying [MISC French  ] foreign policy . 
The MFA will work overtime to ensure continuity in [MISC French  ] policy positions . 
Over time , and as he [LOC PARIS  ] 00001844 004 OF 004 gains experience , [PER Sarkozy  ] is certain to assert his authority over foreign policy more directly . 
It still remains to be seen whether [PER Sarkozy  ] will create -- as proposed by [PER Pierre Lellouche  ] -- the [MISC French  ] equivalent of a [ORG National Security Council  ] that would supplant the Presidential diplomatic cell and assume a larger role in coordinating [MISC French  ] foreign policy ; we have no indication [PER Sarkozy  ] has personally signed on to such a move . 
It is also unclear whether the [LOC Presidency  ] 's [ORG Africa Cell  ] , which has long enjoyed a privileged position , will survive in its present form . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] 's desire to move away from [MISC Elysee-centered  ] personal diplomacy with [MISC African  ] leaders may mean the days of this bureaucratic post-colonial throwback may be numbered. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Although [PER Sarkozy  ] will initially be focused on domestic reforms and relaunching the [ORG EU  ] , he will also grasp every opportunity to showcase his leadership of a re-invigorated [LOC France  ] on the international scene , confident of its place in the world . 
This entails -- and he will not be shy about repeating this point publicly -- establishing a relationship of trust and working together productively with the [LOC United States  ] . 
The Deputy Secretary 's May 15-16 visit will offer the first occasion to make our views known to the new Administration , as it comes into office ( unfortunately , this also means that [PER Sarkozy  ] himself will be unavailable for meetings ) . 
The Defense Secretary 's June 5-6 visit to [LOC France  ] will offer an excellent opportunity to engage the leaders of the newly-constituted government .
