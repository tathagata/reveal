( U ) During a February 6 courtesy call by the Ambassador , Worker 's General Union ( [ORG UGT  ] ) Secretary General [PER Candido Mendez  ] expressed concern that the [ORG USG  ] decision to deny authorization to transfer [LOC U.S.  ] components as part of [LOC Spain  ] 's deal to sell [ORG EADS  ] CASA aircraft to [LOC Venezuela  ] could cost [LOC Spain  ] important jobs in the defense industry . 
[PER Mendez  ] said the more important contract was for the construction of the naval vessels by shipbuilder " [ORG Navantia  ] , " but that the 12 [ORG EADS  ] CASA aircraft still represented a valuable contract that could now be lost . 
[PER Mendez  ] noted that the [ORG UGT  ] , [LOC Spain  ] 's largest union and historically a close ally of the [ORG Socialist Party  ] , was no friend of the [ORG Chavez  ] government . 
He said the [ORG UGT  ] had taken a strong stand in defense of [LOC Venezuela  ] 's CVT labor union , leading [ORG Chavez  ] to expel the [ORG UGT  ] representative in [LOC Caracas.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Ambassador explained that the [ORG USG  ] decision was based on our growing concerns regarding the direction of the [MISC Venezuelan  ] government and was not aimed at [LOC Spain  ] . 
He said the [ORG USG  ] had laid out its concerns to the [MISC Spanish  ] government in great detail over many months and was disappointed that [LOC Spain  ] had concluded an agreement with [ORG Chavez  ] nonetheless . 
The Ambassador noted that [ORG EADS  ] CASA -- and the unions -- had more to gain commercially by pursuing contracts with the [ORG USG  ] and other governments than through a relationship with the [ORG Chavez  ] government . 
Regarding the naval vessels , the Ambassador said the [MISC Spanish  ] government had assured the [ORG USG  ] that there would be no [LOC U.S.  ] components involved . 
However , if there did turn out to be [LOC U.S.  ] components on the vessels , the [ORG USG  ] would look very carefully at any associated technology transfer request. //SPAIN LABOR ISSUES// <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) [PER Mendez  ] outlined his three priorities as leader of the [MISC UGT:  ] the prevalence of temporary employment contracts as opposed to permanent positions , high unemployment among youth , and a high unemployment rate among women . 
[PER Mendez  ] said the issue of [LOC Spain  ] 's low population growth rate was being resolved through increased immigration , though he acknowledged that immigration was generating its own set of challenges . 
He took credit for the [MISC Zapatero  ] government 's 2005 amnesty of illegal immigrants , saying the [ORG UGT  ] had quietly proposed the measure as the only way to resolve the abuses typical of employment in the informal sector . 
[PER Mendez  ] said the [ORG UGT  ] had borrowed directly from the recent strategy of the [ORG AFL-CIO  ] in welcoming immigrant labor as a new source of members ( NOTE: only 18 percent of the [MISC Spanish  ] labor force is unionized . 
END NOTE ) . 
He said the [ORG UGT  ] had conciously selected a [MISC North African  ] immigrant woman to head its Immigrant Affairs office to send a message to potential new members. //COMMENT// <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Mendez  ] was friendly and gregarious in his meeting with the Ambassador and clearly wanted to establish a good relationship . 
He did not raise the [ORG UGT  ] 's strong opposition to the war in [LOC Iraq  ] or his organization of massive rallies against the war , even when the discussion turned to the danger posed by extremist veteran jihadists of that conflict returning to their homes in [LOC Europe  ] . 
[PER Mendez  ] seemed satisfied by the Ambassador 's explanation on the [ORG EADS  ] CASA aircraft issue , though he was obviously concerned by the possibility of delays in the execution of the ship deal . 
Doubtless he recalled the violent strikes carried out by shipyard workers across [LOC Spain  ] when the [ORG Navantia  ] 's predecessor , [ORG IZAR  ] , was forced to trim jobs in response to a business slowdown . 
For [PER Mendez  ] and other union leaders , the possibility of retaining hundreds of jobs in this failing industry overshadows any qualms they may have about dealing with [ORG Chavez  ] .
