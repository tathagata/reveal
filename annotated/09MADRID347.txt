( C ) [MISC SUMMARY:  ] A [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG NGO  ] has requested that the [ORG National Court  ] indict six [ORG Bush Administration  ] officials for creating a legal framework that allegedly permitted torture . 
The [ORG NGO  ] is attempting to have the case heard by Investigating Judge [PER Baltasar Garzon  ] , internationally known for his dogged pursuit of “universal jurisdiction” cases . 
[PER Garzon  ] has passed the complaint to the prosecutor’s office for them to determine if there is a legitimate case . 
Although he seemed displeased to have this dropped in his lap , Chief Prosecutor [PER Javier Zaragoza  ] told us that in all likelihood he would have no option but to open a case . 
He said he did not envision indictments or arrest warrants in the near future . 
He will also argue against the case being assigned to [PER Garzon  ] . 
MFA and MOJ contacts have told us they are concerned about the case , but have stressed the independence of the [MISC Spanish  ] judiciary . 
They too have suggested the case will move slowly . 
END SUMMARY . 
The Accused ----------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The six accused are: former Attorney General [PER Gonzales  ] ; [PER David Addington  ] , former chief of staff and legal adviser to the Vice President ; [PER William Haynes  ] , former [ORG DOD General Counsel  ] ; [PER Douglas Feith  ] , former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy ; [PER Jay Bybee  ] , former head of the [ORG DOJ Office of Legal Counsel  ] ; and [PER John Yoo  ] , a former member of [LOC Bybee’s  ] staff. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG NGO  ] that filed the criminal complaint is the [ORG Association for the Dignity of Spanish Prisoners  ] . 
According to [MISC Spanish  ] press reports , a team of four lawyers worked on the complaint . 
This team also brought a case for a different [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG NGO  ] in January 2009 against [PER Ehud Barak  ] and six senior [MISC Israeli  ] military officials for alleged war crimes in [LOC Gaza  ] in 2002 . 
( [LOC Note:  ] In early 2009 , the press reported that FM [MISC Moratinos  ] had told the [ORG GOI Spain  ] would revise its universal jurisdiction laws to prevent such cases ; we cannot corroborate this . 
End note . 
) [PER Gonzalo Boye  ] Tucet is one of the four lawyers behind the current lawsuit and is taking the lead with the media . 
Open source material identifies [PER Boye  ] as a [MISC Chilean-born  ] lawyer who is a former member of the [ORG International Revolutionary Movement  ] . 
He served eight years in a [MISC Spanish  ] prison as part of a 14-year sentence he received for his role in the 1988 kidnapping of a [MISC Spanish  ] businessman , a plot which reportedly was financed in part by [ORG ETA.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [ORG NGO  ] is emphasizing that [LOC Spain  ] has a duty to investigate because five [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainees are either [MISC Spanish  ] citizens or were/are [MISC Spanish  ] residents . 
However , the [ORG NGO  ] does not claim to be representing these individuals . 
Their names are: [PER Hamed Abderrahman Ahmed  ] ( known in the media as “The [MISC Spanish  ] Taliban” ) ; [PER Lahcen Ikassrien  ] ( aka [PER Chaj Hasan  ] ) ; [PER Reswad Abdulsam  ] ; [PER Jamiel Abdul Latif  ] al [PER Bana  ] ( aka [PER Abu Anas  ] ) ; and [PER Omar Deghayes  ] . 
[ORG MADRID  ] 00000347 002.2 OF 004 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG NGO  ] has attempted to steer this case directly to [ORG National Court  ] Investigating Judge [PER Baltasar Garzon  ] . 
For two decades , [PER Garzon  ] has generated international headlines with high profile cases involving [MISC Spanish  ] politicians , [ORG ETA  ] , radical [MISC Islamic  ] terrorists , and crimes against humanity . 
Perhaps his most famous case was his attempt to bring to trial in [LOC Spain  ] former [MISC Chilean  ] ruler [PER Augustin Pinochet  ] . 
[PER Garzon  ] has a reputation for being more interested in publicity than detail in his cases . 
The [MISC NGO’s  ] argument for [PER Garzon  ] taking the case is that he investigated some of the individuals named in paragraph four as part of an investigation of al [MISC Qaeda  ] cell in [LOC Spain  ] . 
[PER Garzon  ] has passed the [MISC NGO’s  ] complaint to the prosecutor’s office for them to determine if there is a legitimate case . 
The Complaint ------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) Post has forwarded the 98-page complaint to [LOC L. In  ] sum , it alleges that the accused conspired with criminal intent to construct a legal framework to permit interrogation techniques and detentions in violation of international law . 
The complaint describes a number of [LOC U.S.  ] documents , including: a December 28 , 2001 , memorandum regarding [LOC U.S.  ] courts’ jurisdiction over [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainees ; a February 7 , 2002 , memorandum saying the detainees were not covered by the [ORG Geneva Convention  ] ; a March 13 , 2002 , memorandum on new interrogation techniques ; an August 1 , 2002 , memorandum on the definition of torture ; a November 27 , 2002 , memorandum recommending approval of 15 new interrogation techniques ; and a March 14 , 2003 , memorandum providing a legal justification for new interrogation techniques . 
The complaint also cites a 2006 [ORG U.S. Supreme Court  ] case which its says held the February 2002 memo violated international law and President Obama’s recent Executive Order on ensuring lawful interrogations. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The complaint asserts [MISC Spanish  ] jurisdiction by claiming that the alleged crimes committed at [LOC Guantanamo  ] violated the 1949 [ORG Geneva Convention  ] and its Additional Protocols of 1977 , the 1984 [ORG Convention Against Torture  ] or Other Cruel , Unusual or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , and the 1998 [LOC Rome  ] Statute . 
The GOS is a signatory to all three instruments . 
The complaint cites [ORG Article  ] 7 of the 1984 [ORG Convention Against Torture  ] , which states that if a person accused of torture is not extradited to the nation that is bringing a case against him or her , then the competent authorities in the country where the person is should bring a case against him or her . 
There is media speculation that one of the [MISC NGO’s  ] goals may be to encourage the [LOC U.S.  ] to begin judicial proceedings on this matter. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) The complaint does not specifically call for arrest warrants . 
Rather , it ends with a call for the [MISC Spanish  ] courts to take statements from the accused and to request information from the [ORG USG  ] about the various internal documents cited in the complaint ( declassification dates and authorities , an official report about the legal nature of memoranda such as the ones cited in the complaint , and an official report on the legal nature and binding force of Executive Orders ) . 
Contacts with [MISC Spanish  ] Authorities --------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) On April 1 , [PER POLOFF  ] and Embassy [MISC FSN Legal Adviser  ] met [ORG National Court Chief Prosecutor  ] [PER Javier Zaragoza  ] , who said [ORG MADRID  ] 00000347 003.2 OF 004 that he personally will decide whether to open a criminal case . 
There is no statutory timeframe for his decision . 
[PER Zaragoza  ] said the complaint appears well-documented and in all likelihood he will have no option but to open a case ( the evidence was on his desk in four red folders a foot tall ) . 
Visibly displeased with this having been dropped in his lap , [PER Zaragoza  ] said he was in no rush to proceed with the case and in any event will argue that the case should not be assigned to [PER Garzon  ] . 
[PER Zaragoza  ] acknowledged that [PER Garzon  ] has the “right of first refusal , ” but said he will recommend that Garzon’s colleague , Investigating Judge [PER Ismael Moreno  ] , should be assigned the case . 
[PER Zaragoza  ] said the case ties in with [PER Moreno’s  ] ongoing investigations into alleged illegal “CIA flights” that have transited [LOC Spain  ] carrying detainees to [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
[PER Zaragoza  ] said that if [PER Garzon  ] disregards his recommendation and takes the case , he will appeal . 
[PER Zaragoza  ] added that Garzon’s impartiality was very suspect , given his public criticism of [LOC Guantanamo  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] war on terror ( we note that , among other things , [PER Garzon  ] narrated a documentary in 2008 that was extremely critical of the [LOC U.S.  ] involvement in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] and its approach to fighting terrorism ) and his August 2008 public statements that former President [PER Bush  ] should be tried for war crimes. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Zaragoza  ] noted that [LOC Spain  ] would not be able to claim jurisdiction in the case if the [ORG USG  ] opened its own investigation , which he much preferred as the best way forward and described as “the only way out” for the [ORG USG  ] . 
He cited the complaint against [MISC Israeli  ] officials mentioned above and said he would request the investigating judge close that case once he had formal notice that the [MISC Israelis  ] had opened their own investigation. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) On March 31 and April 1 , the Acting DCM discussed the case separately with FM [ORG Moratinos’ Chief  ] of Staff [PER Agustin Santos  ] , and [ORG MOJ  ] Director General for [ORG International Judicial Cooperation Aurora Mejia  ] . 
[PER Santos  ] said the case was worrisome . 
He noted that the [MISC Spanish  ] judiciary was independent , but he opined that these universal jurisdiction cases often sputtered out after the initial burst of publicity . 
He also noted that they tended to move very slowly through the system . 
[LOC Mejia  ] also stressed that the judiciary was independent , and added that the [ORG MOJ  ] had no official information regarding the case and knew nothing about it beyond what the media had reported . 
She said privately that the reaction to the complaint in the [ORG MOJ  ] was “horror.” A/DCM stressed to both that this was a very serious matter for the [ORG USG  ] and asked that the Embassy be kept informed of any developments . 
Comment ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Given Spain’s reputation for liberally invoking universal jurisdiction , this may not be the last such case brought here ( nor is it the first -- in 2007 , a different [MISC Spanish  ] NGO brought a complaint against former [ORG SECDEF  ] Rumsfeld for crimes against humanity based on the [LOC Iraq  ] war and [LOC Abu Ghraib  ] . 
[PER Zaragoza  ] told us that case was quietly dismissed although he could not recall the grounds ) . 
The fact that this complaint targets former [ORG Administration  ] legal officials may reflect a “stepping-stone” strategy designed to pave the way for complaints against even more senior officials . 
Both the media and [ORG Post’s FSN Legal Advisor  ] suspect the complaint was prepared with the assistance of lawyers outside [LOC Spain  ] , perhaps in the [LOC U.S.  ] , and perhaps in [ORG MADRID  ] 00000347 004.2 OF 004 collaboration with [MISC NGO’s  ] such as [ORG Human Rights Watch  ] or Reprieve . 
It appears to have been drafted by someone who understands the [LOC U.S.  ] legal system far better than the average [MISC Spanish  ] lawyer . 
For all the publicity universal jurisdiction cases excite ( Garzon’s attempt to extradite [PER Pinochet  ] from the [LOC UK  ] comes to mind ) , we only know of one case ever tried here ( involving a former member of [MISC Argentina’s  ] military junta ) . 
Based on what [PER Zaragoza  ] told us , we suspect the case will eventually be referred to the [ORG National Court  ] for investigation , although that step may not come for some time . 
Once it reaches the [ORG National Court  ] , these cases seem to move slowly , periodically generating publicity as new evidence is taken ( as with [MISC Moreno’s  ] investigation into so-called [LOC Guantanamo  ] flights ) . 
Whether this case will end up with [PER Garzon  ] , [PER Moreno  ] , or some other judge , we cannot say . 
[PER Garzon  ] , despite his penchant for publicity and criticism of certain aspects of [LOC U.S.  ] policy , has worked well with the [LOC U.S.  ] on more routine criminal matters ( although we think a direct approach to him on this case could well be counter-productive ) . 
[PER Moreno  ] , while his reputation as a judge stands higher among legal insiders , has been cooler in his dealings us . 
We suspect the [MISC Spanish  ] Government , whatever its disagreements with the policies of the [ORG Bush Administration  ] , will find this case inconvenient . 
Despite the pro forma public comment of [ORG First Vice  ] President [PER Fernandez de la Vega  ] that the [ORG GOS  ] would respect whatever decision the courts make in this matter , the timing could not be worse for President [PER Zapatero  ] as he tries to improve ties with the [LOC U.S.  ] and get the [MISC Spanish  ] public focused on the future of the relationship rather than the past . 
That said , we do not know if the government would be willing to take the risky step of trying behind the scenes to influence the prosecutor’s recommendation on this case or what their reaction to such a request would be .
