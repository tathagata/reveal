WITMER-HOLLIDAY EMAILS 9-22 THRU 10-7 Classified By: PolCouns [PER Mary E. Daly  ] reasons 1.5 ( b ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Dutch  ] Prime Minister [PER Jan Balkenende  ] approached [MISC Nigerian  ] President [PER Obasanjo  ] on the margins of the [LOC UNGA  ] in [LOC New York  ] . 
The [ORG GoNL  ] strongly maintains that former [MISC Liberian  ] President [PER Charles Taylor  ] must face his indictment at the Special Court for [LOC Sierra Leone  ] , and [PER Balkenende  ] encouraged [PER Obasanjo  ] to address this issue . 
MFA contacts reported to PolOff that [PER Obasanjo  ] acknowledged that he agrees [PER Taylor  ] should eventually face the Court . 
However , the [MISC Nigerian  ] President stated that action now to force [PER Taylor  ] to do so could negatively impede the peace process in [LOC Liberia  ] . 
[PER Obasanjo  ] wants to wait to address this issue until the peace process has a chance to get off the ground. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC Dutch  ] MFA Deputy Head for [LOC West Africa  ] Roel van der [PER Veen  ] interpreted [PER Obasanjo  ] 's comments as a positive . 
The [ORG GoNL  ] previously had concerns that [LOC Nigeria  ] would oppose [PER Taylor  ] 's need to face his indictment due to his asylum deal , and were pleased to hear otherwise . 
Appreciative of [PER Obasanjo  ] 's viewpoint , the [MISC Dutch  ] plan to wait one to two months to allow the peace process to develop . 
Following such a period , [PER Van der Veen  ] expects that the [ORG GoNL  ] will ask the [ORG EU  ] to approach [LOC Nigeria  ] formally to request action. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Note: The [MISC Dutch  ] have brought up [PER Taylor  ] 's court indictment at several [ORG EU  ] Africa working group meetings since [PER Taylor  ] 's departure from [LOC Liberia  ] . 
The [ORG GoNL  ] has been disheartened by the lack of interest from fellow member states . 
[PER Van der Veen  ] reports that the [ORG GoNL  ] will not let [PER Taylor  ] 's indictment be forgotten . 
He does not expect any other member state to broach this issue in the following months ; however , the [ORG GoNL  ] will not block [ORG EU  ] action in the upcoming months if proposed by another member state . 
End note .
