Reason: 1.4 ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY: WHA Deputy Assistant Secretary [PER Christopher McMullen  ] , s visit to [LOC Brazil  ] and briefings to [ORG GOB  ] officials on the [ORG U.S.-Colombia Defense Cooperation Agreement  ] ( [ORG DCA  ] ) helped ease [MISC Brazilian  ] concerns over the issue and spurred new dialog aimed at greater bilateral and multilateral cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER McMullen  ] , s conversations with [MISC Brazilian  ] Ministry of Foreign Relations ( [ORG Itamaraty  ] ) officials and a senior presidency foreign policy advisor clarified [LOC U.S.  ] intentions with the [ORG CDA  ] as preparing part of a long-term strategy to decrease the [LOC U.S.  ] military presence in [LOC South America  ] . 
[ORG GOB  ] officials expressed interest in greater dialog with the [LOC United States  ] on security and regional issues and highlighted several opportunities for better cooperation and communication in the future . 
It appears that the jarring public criticism of the [ORG DCA  ] represents an effort to curry favor with [LOC Venezuela  ] in advance of the [ORG UNASUL  ] summit in [LOC Bariloche  ] , with the goal of lowering tensions there and preserving [ORG UNASUL  ] . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) Charge hosted a lunch for DAS [PER McMullen  ] August 25 with seven senior [ORG Itamaraty  ] officials: Under Secretary for Political Affairs Ambassador [PER Vera Machado  ] , Under Secretary for [LOC Latin America  ] Ambassador [PER Enio Cordeiro  ] , [ORG Pol/Mil Advisor  ] to Deputy Foreign Minister Guimaraes Ambassador [PER Marcos Pinta Gama  ] , [ORG Policy Planning Director  ] Ambassador [PER Hermano Telles Ribeiro  ] , [ORG US/Canada/Inter-American Affairs Department Head  ] ( Assistant Secretary equivalent ) [PER Carlos Abreu  ] , [ORG Transnational Illicit Activities Department Head Virginia Toniatti  ] , and [LOC South America  ] II [ORG Department Head Clemente Baena Soares  ] . 
Separately , [PER McMullen  ] met with presidency foreign policy advisor Ambassador [PER Marcel Biato  ] . 
[PER McMullen  ] also met with [MISC Colombian  ] Ambassador [PER Tony Jozame  ] , who conveyed [ORG GOB  ] officials , positive reception to the clarifications he had made on the [ORG DCA  ] and to his assurances that [MISC Brazilian  ] borders and sovereignty would continue to be respected. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In his conversations with [ORG GOB  ] officials , [PER McMullen  ] explained the origins of the [ORG U.S.-Colombia DCA  ] and emphasized that the [ORG DCA  ] was meant to lay the foundation for a continued decrease in [LOC U.S.  ] military presence in [LOC Colombia  ] . 
[PER McMullen  ] highlighted the routine nature of the agreement and the explicit provisions requiring respect for [LOC Colombia  ] , s and other nations , sovereignty . 
[PER McMullen  ] explained that the [ORG DCA  ] does not expand the scope of [LOC U.S.  ] presence in [LOC Colombia  ] , and made clear that the [LOC U.S.  ] goal is to civilianize its presence in [LOC Latin America  ] , in particular because we understand the history and sensitivity of [LOC U.S.  ] presence in the region . 
[PER McMullen  ] stressed that the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOC  ] did not want to discuss the [ORG DCA  ] prior to concluding negotiations , and only did so after the details were leaked to the [MISC Colombian  ] press . 
He noted that such agreements are so common that they should not raise suspicion . 
[PER McMullen  ] acknowledged , however , that lack of information had raised concerns , which is why he was visiting [LOC Brazil  ] , [LOC Uruguay  ] , and [LOC Argentina  ] . 
NATIONAL , REGIONAL SENSITIVITIES ON FULL DISPLAY -------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG Itamaraty  ] officials and [PER Biato  ] showed a great deal of interest in the details of the [ORG DCA  ] . 
[PER Machado  ] said the [ORG GOB  ] was surprised to find out about the agreement through the media and emphasized that part of [LOC Brazil  ] , s concern stems in large measure from the lack of information available on the [ORG DCA  ] . 
[PER Machado  ] identified security of the [MISC Brazilian  ] [LOC Amazon  ] and regional stability as important and sensitive issues for [LOC Brazil  ] . 
She explained that there is a perception among [MISC Brazilians  ] , especially those in the north , that the [LOC Amazon  ] is a region coveted by foreigners searching for biodiversity and natural resources who have a hidden interest in taking it over . 
Therefore , any foreign presence near the [LOC Amazon  ] region can become an explosive issue . 
[PER Machado  ] also highlighted that news of the [ORG DCA  ] came out at a time of significant regional tensions and as [LOC Brazil  ] was in the process of consolidating [ORG UNASUL  ] as a mechanism for addressing those tensions . 
While respecting [LOC Colombia  ] , s sovereign right to negotiate the [ORG DCA  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] could not ignore the serious implications for stability in the region . 
[PER Biato  ] explained that , as long as the [LOC United States  ] maintains a presence in the region , it will be a difficult and neuralgic issue that will periodically resurface and require constant management . 
While [LOC Brazil  ] understands the reasons for a [LOC U.S.  ] presence in [LOC Colombia  ] , [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001076 002.2 OF 003 [PER Biato  ] said , the [ORG GOB  ] , s goal is to work to remove the conditions that make this presence necessary. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Both [PER Biato  ] and [PER Machado  ] requested greater information sharing and guarantees . 
[PER Machado  ] requested written assurances that equipment at the [MISC Colombian  ] bases would not be used to violate the sovereignty of neighboring countries and that the [LOC U.S.  ] presence would not expand beyond [LOC Colombia  ] , s borders . 
( [MISC Colombian  ] Ambassador [PER Jozame  ] told [PER McMullen  ] that [ORG GOB  ] officials had asked the [ORG GOC  ] to add a clause to the [ORG DCA  ] specifying that actions are only to be undertaken within [MISC Colombian  ] borders . 
) [PER Machado  ] also suggested that the [ORG DCA  ] document be made available before the next [ORG UNASUL  ] meeting , scheduled for August 28 in [LOC Bariloche  ] , as she believed the provisions for respect of other nations , sovereignty would help allay concerns . 
TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK GREATER BILATERAL DIALOG ------------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Biato  ] stressed that , because of the history of [LOC U.S.  ] presence in the region , the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] need to have a more fluid dialog that allows [LOC Brazil  ] to develop a level of trust regarding [LOC U.S.  ] actions in the region . 
The goal is not to agree on everything , but to discuss sensitive issues so that [LOC Brazil  ] can demonstrate to its [MISC South American  ] neighbors that it has a full understanding of what the [LOC United States  ] is doing in the region . 
[ORG Itamaraty  ] officials expressed interest in restarting [ORG Pol/Mil  ] talks , both on a formal and informal level , as a way to increase dialogue and smooth discussions on sensitive issues like the [MISC Colombian  ] bases . 
[ORG GOB  ] officials also raised the possibility of increased intelligence sharing between the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Colombia  ] and other [ORG UNASUL  ] countries . 
[PER McMullen  ] said such increased cooperation is worth exploring . 
PRESSING FOR INTERVENTION IN [LOC HONDURAS  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG GOB  ] officials pushed for greater [LOC U.S.  ] response and intervention in [LOC Honduras  ] . 
[PER Biato  ] said [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula  ] was pleased to hear from President [PER Obama  ] that the [ORG USG  ] would consider addition measures in [LOC Honduras  ] . 
He compared the pressure the [LOC United States  ] is receiving on [LOC Honduras  ] and [LOC Venezuela  ] to the heat the [ORG GOB  ] has taken for its stance with [LOC Bolivia  ] , [LOC Ecuador  ] , and [LOC Paraguay  ] . 
" It is the price you pay for doing the right thing . 
" With [PER Biato  ] and [ORG Itamaraty  ] officials , [PER McMullen  ] said the [LOC U.S.  ] was prepared to ratchet up the pressure on the [LOC Micheletti de facto  ] government . 
However , he said that many in the [LOC United States  ] perceive a contradiction in applying the [ORG Inter-American Democratic Charter  ] ( [ORG IADC  ] ) to [LOC Honduras  ] without also raising [MISC IADC-related  ] issues in [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
[PER Biato  ] responded it is the [ORG GOB  ] , s assessment that [LOC Venezuela  ] is " not on the path toward " and " nowhere near " an authoritarian regime , and that they do not believe public criticism of [PER Chavez  ] is helpful . 
[PER Biato  ] and [ORG Itamaraty  ] officials suggested that it would be important for the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] to discuss implementation of the [ORG IADC  ] , as a common understanding of its provisions and requirements is essential to implementing it . 
POTENTIAL OPENING FOR TRILATERAL COOPERATION WITH [LOC BOLIVIA  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG Itamaraty  ] officials highlighted their interest and an opening for possible trilateral cooperation on counternarcotics issues with [LOC Bolivia  ] and the [LOC United States  ] . 
[PER Cordeiro  ] said [MISC Brazilian  ] Foreign Minister [ORG Amorim  ] recently raised the possibility of joint cooperation with the [LOC United States  ] in a meeting with the [MISC Bolivian  ] Foreign Minister , who agreed it would be beneficial . 
[PER Cordeiro  ] asked for concrete ways in which the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Brazil  ] could engage [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
He noted that [MISC Bolivian  ] sensitivities with regard to [ORG DEA  ] and , more broadly , [LOC U.S.  ] respect for [MISC Bolivian  ] sovereignty are substantial , and will need to be taken into account . 
But he added that the [MISC Bolivians  ] are waiting for a signal from the [LOC United States  ] to increase engagement . 
[PER Machado  ] and [PER Cordeiro  ] stressed the importance of reinstating [ORG ATPDEA  ] privileges . 
They said [LOC Brazil  ] will replace USD 21 million of lost [ORG ATPDEA  ] market in [LOC Bolivia  ] , and [LOC Argentina  ] USD 9 million . 
[PER McMullen  ] explained the [LOC U.S.  ] efforts at bilateral dialogue with [LOC Bolivia  ] and the complexities of certification and the [ORG ATPDEA  ] process . 
He agreed that a discussion on how our two countries could [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001076 003.2 OF 003 engage [LOC Bolivia  ] on counternarcotics cooperation would be useful . 
MEANWHILE , OUT IN THE MEDIA ------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) During [PER McMullen  ] , s discussions with [ORG GOB  ] officials , media outlets were highlighting comments by FM [ORG Amorim  ] regarding [LOC Brazil  ] , s deep concern over the [ORG DCA  ] and demanding that the [LOC United States  ] answer to the region , s concerns . 
[ORG Amorim  ] this week has publicly demanded transparency and guarantees with the [MISC U.S.-Colombia  ] [ORG DCA  ] , insisting that language be included in the agreement limiting the use of the equipment at the bases to combating narcotrafficking and the [ORG FARC  ] . 
Following the phone call between President [PER Lula  ] and President [PER Obama  ] , [ORG Amorim  ] told the press that President [PER Obama  ] is considering a request to meet with [ORG UNASUL  ] countries in the near future . 
And even after various [ORG USG  ] efforts to explain the nature of the [ORG DCA  ] , [ORG Amorim  ] continued to refer to the bases as " foreign bases " and claimed that the agreement and the " foreign presence " could bring to [LOC South America  ] " problems that are not from the region . 
" COMMENT: WHAT [LOC BRAZIL  ] IS UP TO ------------------------------ <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) DAS [PER McMullen  ] , s visit to explain the [ORG DCA  ] was well received by the [ORG GOB  ] as fulfillment of promises by General [ORG Jones  ] during his visit and , we understand , President [PER Obama  ] during his phone call with President [PER Lula  ] , to provide greater detail on the [ORG DCA  ] . 
The openings on [MISC Pol-Mil  ] talks , CN cooperation with [LOC Bolivia  ] , and discussions of the [ORG IADC  ] are all indications of a new posture toward the [LOC United States  ] that suggest the [ORG GOB  ] heard , internalized , and wants to respond to the expressed interest in broader and more transparent communication brought by [ORG National Security Advisor Jones  ] and other senior [ORG Administration  ] officials over the last few weeks . 
We believe there is a genuine desire on the part of the [ORG GOB  ] to explore greater options for bilateral cooperation. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) In light of the private overtures made to [PER McMullen  ] , [ORG Amorim  ] , s continued outbursts to the press are jarring . 
In explaining these press statements to Charge and [MISC PolCouns  ] , [PER Biato  ] has both suggested , in the first instance , that the press has an axe to grind and cannot be trusted to accurately convey the [ORG GOB  ] , s position . 
There is some truth to this , as [LOC Brazil  ] , s major newspapers have consistently expressed disagreement with the [ORG GOB  ] , s regional foreign policy , but it does not account for what are clearly accurate quotes from [ORG Amorim  ] . 
In this regard , [PER Biato  ] has explained that , as [LOC Brazil  ] tries to maintain its role as mediator among its bickering neighbors , the [ORG GOB  ] has to stay in the center of the regional debate . 
In this instance , this has required the [ORG GOB  ] to shift its public rhetoric toward [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
In other words , although [ORG Amorim  ] , s comments seem to be heightening emotions rather than lowering them , the [ORG GOB  ] has assessed that [LOC Venezuela  ] is the more problematic neighbor to deal with , and sees public statements supportive of its position as helpful in gaining support from President [PER Chavez  ] for taking a less confrontational tone at the upcoming [ORG UNASUL  ] summit in [LOC Bariloche.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) It is entirely plausible that [ORG Amorim  ] , s antics are aimed at making things easier for [LOC Brazil  ] in [LOC Bariloche  ] . 
[PER Biato  ] has told us that [PER Lula  ] was initially reluctant to agree to the meeting , as they saw the potential for it to add to the uproar over the [ORG DCA  ] . 
[LOC Brazil  ] , s main goal for [LOC Bariloche  ] is to prevent it from destroying the still-shaky [ORG UNASUL  ] or relations with a [ORG U.S. Administration  ] with which it is desperate to cultivate a deeper dialogue. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( U ) DAS [PER McMullen  ] has cleared this message .
