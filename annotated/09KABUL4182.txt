In the meantime , the [ORG PRT  ] will work with the Embassy to develop non-judicial mechanisms to bring greater civil service reform , budget and programmatic transparency , and non-judicial forms of accountability to address systemic corruption . 
End Summary . 
GOVERNMENT AS CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE ? --------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In recent weeks the [ORG Ghazni Provincial Reconstruction Team  ] ( [ORG PRT  ] ) engaged extensively with provincial and district-level government officials , law enforcement commanders , and civil society representatives regarding the scope and nature of corruption in [LOC Ghazni Province  ] . 
This report includes those examples of recent and possibly on-going corrupt practices that were raised by multiple , credible senior [ORG GIRoA  ] officials in [LOC Ghazni Province  ] . 
Most individuals the [ORG PRT  ] spoke with were willing to speak openly about corruption in the province ; many are well aware of the push by the international community to root out corruption , and may have their own motivations in highlighting corruption by others officials and minimizing attention to themselves . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] even provided a written summary of information contained in NDS files . 
These conversations paint a picture of criminal enterprise masquerading as public administration in [LOC Ghazni  ] . 
Although the [ORG PRT  ] has no capacity to confirm the allegations raised , the consistency of reports alleging corruption among senior government officials is striking . 
Long-standing criminal operations centered on [MISC Deh Yak District Governor  ] [PER Hajji Fazil  ] , [LOC Ghazni City Mayor  ] [PER Hakimullah Ghazniwal  ] , [ORG Meshrano Jirga  ] member and [MISC Tajik  ] community leader [PER Mawlana Abdul Rahman  ] , and Director of Reconstruction and [ORG Rural Development  ] [PER Sanai Mayel  ] -- with significant involvement by current [LOC Ghazni  ] Governor [PER Usman Usmani  ] . 
THE GHAZNI [MISC ARBAKAI  ] ------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] informed us that Governor [PER Usmani  ] and some district governors embezzled funds intended to pay local [MISC Afghan  ] “Arbakai” security forces who worked during the election period securing polling sites . 
( Per reftel B , community based security payments were problematic in many provinces , and there was little transparency relating to the payment mechanisms . 
) According to these sources , approximately [MISC USD  ] 160,000 was dispatched from the [ORG Presidential Palace  ] to Governor [PER Usmani  ] to pay the [MISC Arbakai  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stated that [PER Usmani  ] kept approximately [MISC USD  ] 100,000 , dividing the rest between the district governors of [LOC Deh Yak  ] , [LOC Giro  ] , [PER Zanakhan  ] , [LOC Gelan  ] , [LOC Qarabah  ] , [ORG Ab Band  ] , [ORG Moqur  ] , and [LOC Ghazni City  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said these district governors submitted fictitious lists of [MISC Arbakai  ] from their districts and have not distributed any of the payments . 
( Comment: Considering the general lack of security in these districts , with the exception of [LOC Ghazni City  ] and parts of [LOC Qarabagh  ] , and our assumption that little or no voting actually took place there on election day , we doubt there were any [MISC Arbakai  ] working in these districts in the first place . 
End Comment . 
) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] similarly affirmed that no payments were disbursed there to pay 50 legitimate [MISC Arbakai  ] . 
[LOC KABUL  ] 00004182 002 OF 004 MISAPPROPRIATING REFUGEE LAND ----------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) According to both [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [MISC Afghan  ] government officials appropriated land in 2005 outside [LOC Ghazni  ] to create a “returnee village , ” where refugees and Internally [MISC Displace Persons  ] ( [ORG IDP  ] ) originally from [LOC Ghazni  ] could return and receive a small plot of land on which to build a home . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] The commission divided the land up into four large sections , each consisting of many small plots . 
Two of the sections are on a hill and are generally undesirable as real estate , while the other two sections are flat land nearer [LOC Ghazni  ] city and ideal for building and development . 
Most of the land in the flat sections was given to government officials , their relatives -- some of whom were minors , and fictitious refugees . 
Allegedly , they were later sold for profit . 
The report of [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was sent to then-Chief Prosecutor of [LOC Ghazni  ] , who appointed a team to investigate cases which included the director of refugees and the deputy governor . 
No indictment was ever issued . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] confirmed that these allegations are largely true . 
THE WHEAT HEIST --------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) According toXXXXXXXXXXXX , senior government officials have long corrupted the [ORG World Food Program’s  ] ( [ORG WFP  ] ) emergency wheat shipments and Work for [ORG Food Program  ] . 
According to these sources , the governor , [ORG RRD  ] line director , and certain district governors are engaged in a scheme to divert [ORG WFP  ] wheat and other food items to the black market to be sold . 
Part of the scheme involves pocketing the money from [ORG WFP  ] to pay for transport of the wheat , thus providing the [ORG RRD  ] director an excuse to tell the farther out , predominantly [LOC Hazara  ] districts that he cannot deliver because he cannot pay for transportation . 
The Governor allegedly signs transportation contracts , but the wheat is sold and the money embezzled. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Former [LOC Zanakhan District  ] Governor [PER Mohammed Hassan  ] was arrested attempting to sell a shipment and released on order from the governor . 
( Note: Ref A reports on [PER Mohammed Hassan  ] , who was fired as District Governor of [LOC Qarabagh  ] district after he was arrested and charged with rape in the spring 2009 ; he was released under questionable circumstances and secured an appointment from Governor [PER Usmani  ] as District governor of [MISC Zanakhan  ] . 
[PER Hassan  ] was fired from this post on December 2 . 
End Note . 
) According to sources , [MISC Deh Yak District Governor  ] [PER Hajji Fazil  ] also sold wheat intended for 1,788 families in [MISC Deh Yak  ] . 
Provincial Reconstruction Team officials also recently prevented [ORG RRD  ] from diverting wheat intended for Ajiristan District to [LOC Qarabagh  ] , where the suspicion was it would either have been sold by the district governor or police chief , or “intercepted” by the insurgency . 
CHROMITE SMUGGLING TO [LOC PAKISTAN  ] , CONTRACTOR SHAKE-DOWNS , PERSONAL ENRICHMENT --------------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , Governor [PER Usmani  ] has long been running a chromite smuggling operation into [LOC Pakistan  ] from mines in [MISC Zanakhan District  ] , as well as [ORG Wardak  ] and [LOC Logar Provinces  ] , sending his personal security force to escort trucks carrying chromite so they can pass Highway One checkpoints without inspection . 
According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the chromite trafficking is arranged by [PER Hajji Pacha Han  ] , an [PER Usmani  ] associate from [LOC Kandahar  ] who lives in the [MISC Governor’s  ] official residence . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , for example , that [PER Usmani  ] and [PER Hajji Fazil  ] intervened early this year when eight trucks carrying chromite were seized by the NDS in [LOC Ghazni  ] . 
According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER Usmani  ] and [PER Fazil  ] secured the release of the trucks and the detained smuggler , [PER Hajji Ibrahim  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] informed [ORG Task Force  ] representatives that Governor [PER Usmani  ] and [ORG RRD  ] Director [PER Mayel  ] extort bribes and kickbacks from local businesses and [ORG PRT  ] contractors . 
A simple “shake-down , ” they allege , entails contractors who must pay a bribe to obtain official approvals ; harassment for not paying includes having workers chased off job sites by armed men , sometimes by uniformed members of the [ORG ANP  ] , is also common. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Most credible interlocutors also assert that Governor [PER Usmani  ] and his accomplices in [LOC GIRoA  ] routinely embezzle government funds and international aid money intended for public administration and humanitarian assistance . 
According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the governor receives 1.4 million [MISC Afghanis  ] per month for administrative and representational expenses , but pockets it ; additionally , he allegedly received kickbacks from vendors for official purchases . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] admitted to the [ORG PRT  ] that he similarly funds personal living expenses in [LOC Ghazni  ] city . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) It is difficult to imagine sustainable gains in security , governance , and development agendas without addressing the pervasive corruption that plagues Ghazni’s public administration . 
The foundation of security and governance strategy in [LOC Ghazni  ] , as in [LOC Afghanistan  ] as a whole , requires popular acceptance of and support for [LOC GIRoA  ] authority . 
Obtaining such support is very unlikely given the current situation -- where sub-national government officials’ attitude toward citizens is largely predatory . 
[ORG PRT  ] efforts in [LOC Ghazni  ] have been focused on bringing [LOC GIRoA  ] officials back to [MISC Pashtun  ] districts where they have been absent for years . 
It is becoming increasingly difficult , however , to convince local [MISC Pushtuns  ] that [LOC GIRoA  ] presence and development programs portend stability and prosperity . 
The venality of provincial administration instead turns historical [MISC Pushtun  ] skepticism of central government authority into outright hostility . 
Ongoing and new efforts to link the population of [LOC Ghazni  ] to legitimate governance -- short , concerted , and effective efforts to root out corruption -- will pose significant challenges. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) On their own , dismayed provincial law enforcement and judicial institutions are clearly unwilling and incapable of dealing with the scope of corruption they face . 
Ghazni’s provincial [ORG ANP  ] and NDS chiefs want to clean up public administration , but admit they remain powerless to tackle the most egregious corruption cases . 
Senior government officials act with impunity ; minor officials use bribery and political influence to avoid prosecution . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is blunt about the road ahead: [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
Mindful of the above , the impetus and resources needed to address provincial corruption in the near-term must come from outside [LOC Ghazni  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] The [ORG Anti-Corruption Unit  ] ( [ORG ACU  ] ) of the [MISC Major Crimes Task Force  ] , which itself is limited in terms of the number of vetted prosecutors , investigators , and judges , has yet to extend its reach into the provinces ; a system of effective and direct anti-corruption mechanisms is largely lacking within the international community. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) While public corruption in [LOC Ghazni  ] appears pervasive in scope , it lacks significant complexity ; much is considered an open secret . 
Consequently , effective legal action would not require years of work by skilled investigators -- short-term assignment of the right mix of [MISC Afghan  ] prosecutorial staff and supporting [ORG ANP  ] and NDS investigators , as well as USG mentors , could be sufficient to break the criminal cycle of corruption in [LOC Ghazni  ] . 
However , a major challenge to successful legal action by the [LOC GIRoA  ] will be the [MISC Afghan  ] legal system’s limited institutional capacity . 
The [MISC Major Crimes Task Force  ] ( [ORG MCTF  ] ) currently has four vetted prosecutors and a limited number of vetted investigators to numerous pending corruption cases from all over the country . 
As a result , the [ORG PRT  ] and [ORG Task Force  ] will work with the Embassy to develop not only investigative and prosecution tools , but also non-judicial mechanisms to bring greater civil service reform , budget and programmatic transparency , and non-judicial forms of accountability to address systemic corruption . 
Trusted interlocutors in [LOC Ghazni  ] , as is the case elsewhere in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , provide us insight into the activities of nefarious government officials , but they do so at considerable risk to themselves , their families , and associates . 
Should we not quickly develop mechanisms to root out the current corrupt practices and take a firm stand in [LOC Ghazni  ] where corruption is rampant , corrupt government officials will be emboldened and the population further alienated .
