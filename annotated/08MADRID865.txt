( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC SUMMARY:  ] The central government 's relationship with [LOC Spain  ] 's regions--particularly the so-called " historic nationalities " of the [MISC Basque  ] country ( el [ORG Pais Vasco  ] ) , [LOC Catalonia  ] , and to a lesser extent Galicia--continues to be a topic of significant public discussion . 
Two key events have largely driven the debate this summer: the [MISC Basque  ] parliament 's approval of an initiative aimed at redefining the region 's relationship with [ORG Madrid  ] , and the publication of a " Manifesto for a [ORG Common Language  ] " that calls for protecting the rights of [MISC Spanish  ] speakers in regions with co-official languages , such as [ORG Pais Vasco  ] or [LOC Catalonia  ] . 
These are far from the only new developments , however ; in July , two [MISC Catalan  ] political parties ( the [MISC Catalan  ] Socialists , which currently lead a tripartite regional government , and the largest component of the [ORG Convergencia i Unio  ] ( [ORG CiU  ] ) coalition ) voted at their party congresses to stake out stronger regionalist positions , and publication of the regions' fiscal balances sparked controversy as the [ORG GOS  ] worked to renegotiate the regional financing system ( reftel ) . 
The latest events will continue to demand significant [ORG GOS  ] time and energy , drawing attention away from other pressing issues such as [LOC Spain  ] 's worsening economy . 
END SUMMARY //BASQUE REFERENDUM HALTED FOR NOW// <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG Constitutional Tribunal  ] ( [ORG TC  ] ) is currently considering the legality of a [MISC Basque  ] proposal , approved by the regional parliament in late June , to move forward with the referendum portion of the so-called [PER Ibarretxe Plan  ] . 
This initiative , named after regional government head [PER Juan Jose Ibarretxe  ] ( [LOC U.S.  ] governor equivalent ) , asserts the right of the [MISC Basque  ] people to self-determination and seeks to open up a national debate on the political status of the [MISC Basque  ] region . 
The plan calls for a referendum to be held on October 25 , 2008 that , if approved , would a ) support peace negotiations to end [ORG ETA  ] violence if the terrorist group demonstrates its willingness to definitively cease its terrorist activity , and b ) send a mandate to all [MISC Basque  ] political parties to begin a process of negotiation with the central [MISC Spanish  ] government with the aim of reaching agreement on the [MISC Basque  ] people 's right to self-determination , to be put to a referendum before 2011 . 
The [ORG TC  ] , s decision to accept the government 's appeal against the October referendum proposal however , effectively means it would not be held until at least December 15 , 2008--if at all. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG PNV  ] officials stress , both publicly and privately to us , that they will adhere to the [ORG TC  ] , s ruling and have no intention of pursuing " illegal " measures to gain self-determination--even though some [ORG PNV  ] members also tell us they consider it ridiculous that their nonbinding referendum could be ruled unconstitutional . 
[PER Ibarretxe  ] , however , has promised to use all legal means at his disposal to fight for the " [MISC Basque  ] cause . 
" Moreover , some members of his governing coalition , as well as the radical communist-separatist [ORG PCTV  ] party that cast the deciding vote in favor of the referendum , have called for a more aggressive resistance. //POLITICS OF LANGUAGE// <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Language policy has become this summer 's rallying cry against [LOC Spain  ] 's regional nationalists , at least in the media . 
As of late July , more than 130,000 [MISC Spaniards  ] had signed the so-called " Manifesto for a [ORG Common Language  ] " launched in June by philosopher and writer [PER Fernando Savater  ] ( a founder of the new [LOC Union  ] , Progress , and Democracy party that won a congressional seat in its first election in 2008 ) , and supported by around 20 other [MISC Spanish  ] intellectuals . 
The manifesto , also signed by a number of leading opposition [ORG Partido Popular  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) politicians as well as some semi-prominent Socialist supporters , is a reaction to [MISC Basque  ] and especially [MISC Catalan  ] efforts to prioritize the use of their co-official languages in education and public services , which manifesto promoters assert discriminates against Spanish-speakers in those regions . 
Prominent daily [ORG El Mundo  ] , always willing to take up sensationalistic causes against [ORG GOS  ] policies , has trumpeted the latest tally of prominent signatories almost daily on its front page and continues to push the [ORG Manifesto.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Basque  ] and [MISC Catalan  ] natives , as well as some non-natives of the regions , seem to largely regard the Manifesto as a political attack against their languages and national identity , arguing that [MISC Catalan  ] or [PER Euskera  ] ( the [MISC Basque  ] language ) face a far greater threat and that their regions allow both co-official language speakers and [MISC Spanish  ] speakers to live and work there with ease . 
The Manifesto 's complaints are hardly without merit , however , which is [ORG MADRID  ] 00000865 002.2 OF 003 probably why it has attracted some prominent signatories such as major tourism sector company [PER Grupo Marsans  ] ( which owns low-cost carrier Spanair as well as hotel and car rental chains ) , the five national police unions , and national soccer team goalkeeper [PER Iker Casillas  ] , a [MISC Spanish  ] hero following his stellar performance during [LOC Spain  ] 's [MISC European  ] soccer championship in June . 
Education is the main issue for many [MISC Spaniards  ] . 
The [ORG Pais Vasco  ] has decreed that [PER Euskera  ] should be the principal language of teaching , while in [LOC Catalonia  ] public schools are taught in [MISC Catalan  ] with only a maximum of three hours of [MISC Spanish  ] instruction per week . 
Even in [ORG Galicia  ] more than 700 citizens have made formal complaints to the [ORG Galicia Bilingual Association  ] during the past year , alleging various forms of discrimination against [MISC Spanish  ] speakers--such as lower grades for school work done in [MISC Spanish  ] or a refusal to provide [MISC Spanish  ] versions of tax documents and graduation certificates for use in other regions. //POLITICIANS FRAMING REGIONAL DEBATE// <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Regional-nationalist efforts frequently seem to be more inspired by politically motivated party and regional leaders than by popular demand . 
[MISC Basque  ] President [PER Ibarretxe  ] is pushing his plan , according to some [MISC Spanish  ] press sources , despite widespread apathy and even opposition within the [ORG PNV  ] . 
For instance , a senior member of the [ORG PNV  ] executive in late July expressed doubts about the timing of the plan to a visiting poloff . 
[MISC Basque  ] society may be even more divided . 
The well-regarded [PER Euskobarometro  ] in May found solid blocks of support for independence ( 25 % ) , federalism ( 35% ) , and the current autonomy system ( 33% ) , and only 24% at that time wanted [PER Ibarretxe  ] to maintain his position . 
The poll also found that only 16% considered political issues to be a major concern--many more cited unemployment ( 53% ) , violence ( 38% ) , or housing ( 41% ) as one of their top three worries . 
[PER Euskobarometro  ] , however , also noted that [PER Ibarretxe  ] received a 7.5 approval rating from his own electorate , the highest of any [MISC Basque  ] politician , and a 5.1 rating among all [MISC Basques  ] , the second highest number. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Catalonia  ] saw two of its main parties move toward more nationalist ground during party congresses in July , although neither has argued for outright independence . 
[PER Convergencia Democratica  ] , the larger of the two parties in [MISC CiU  ] ( and whose leader , [PER Artur Mas  ] , also leads the coalition ) , approved a party objective of making [LOC Catalonia  ] a free and sovereign nation in the [LOC Europe  ] of the 21st century and calling for the right to self-determination--an objective demanded by the more radical sector of the party , according to media reports . 
The [ORG Catalan Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PSC  ] ) , which is in federation with , rather than merely a branch of , the [ORG PSOE  ] , at its congress seemed to move into ground usually occupied more by nationalist parties like [MISC CiU  ] or the independence-minded [ORG ERC  ] . 
The [ORG PSC  ] called for constitutional reforms to include the " federalist " character of the [MISC Spanish  ] state , reiterated the concept of [LOC Catalonia  ] as " a nation with its own territory , language , culture , and history , which make a national community , " and demanded a voice for the party in [LOC Europe.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Regional politicians are not the only ones to blame , however . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's two main parties , the ruling [ORG PSOE  ] and opposition [ORG PP  ] , have been all but unable to hold civil discussion in recent years on regional issues dealing with [MISC Basques  ] and [MISC Catalans  ] . 
Our [MISC Catalan  ] and [MISC Basque  ] contacts generally accuse the [ORG PP  ] as having taken too strident a tone against the regional nationalists and , particularly during the second [ORG Aznar  ] government ( 2000-04 ) , contributing to an " us versus them " mentality . 
President [PER Zapatero  ] on the other hand tried too hard to make nice with the regions--partly in hopes of capturing more votes for the [MISC Socialists  ] there--but , in giving a few inches , saw the nationalists try to take several miles. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Some observers see hope for improvements over the coming years . 
[PER Francisco Llera  ] , Director of the [PER Euskobarometro  ] program , told us he sees both the [ORG PP  ] and [ORG PSOE  ] as having matured and learned from their mistakes of recent years and believes there may be more room for agreement on issues like the regional financing system , which the [ORG GOS  ] is currently renegotiating . 
[PER Llera  ] notes for example that recently published figures show that the [LOC Community of Madrid  ] , [LOC Balearic Islands  ] , [LOC Catalonia  ] , and [ORG Valencia  ] each put more money into state coffers than they receive back . 
With two regions led by the [ORG PP  ] ( [ORG Madrid  ] and [ORG Valencia  ] ) and two led by the [ORG PSOE  ] ( [LOC Balearics  ] and [LOC Catalonia  ] ) , there is a great incentive for the two parties to reach agreement. //COMMENT// [LOC MADRID  ] 00000865 003.2 OF 003 <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Most of this summer 's events seem to represent politics as usual in [LOC Spain  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's victory in the [MISC European  ] soccer championships offered a small , but telling , insight into the way in which the center-regions debate can intrude on almost any arena . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's success--with a team comprising players from across the country and including tournament [ORG MVP Xavi Hernandez  ] of Barcelona--prompted indifference or even disdain from some [MISC Catalan  ] politicians . 
A spokesperson from the leftist nationalist [ORG ERC  ] said before the championship that some party leaders " hope [LOC Germany  ] defeats [LOC Spain  ] in the championship match . 
" Many press sources hailed the unifying nature of the team , describing a new enthusiasm in places like [LOC Barcelona  ] for the national squad 's success and noted public support for the team by [ORG PNV  ] officials. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Although we continue to watch for signs that [LOC Spain  ] is fracturing , this seems unlikely in the near to medium term ( a sentiment shared by those politicians and observers with whom we have met in recent weeks . 
While Euskobarometro Director [PER Llera  ] may be correct about the prospects for a better climate for debate , we believe that in general [LOC Spain  ] will continue muddling through on this issue , with the [MISC Basques  ] and [MISC Catalans  ] pushing for more decentralized powers and recognition of their historic status ( and other regions balking at anything that might reward these regions at their expense ) , [PER Zapatero  ] trying to make nice with the [ORG Pais Vasco  ] and [LOC Catalonia  ] while fending off their biggest demands , and the [ORG PP  ] resistant to most nationalist demands . 
Nonetheless , center-regional tensions will continue to occupy a significant portion of [LOC Spain  ] 's political energy , distracting the [ORG GOS  ] from more important issues like [LOC Spain  ] 's precarious economy and making its recognition of [LOC Kosovo  ] in the near term unlikely .
