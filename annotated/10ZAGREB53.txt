END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a series of meetings in early to mid-January , Croatian Chief State Prosecutor [PER Mladen Bajic  ] described several ongoing corruption probes to [MISC Poloff  ] which target former Prime Minister [PER Ivo Sanader  ] , current and former ministers , and nearly all major state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) . 
[PER Bajic  ] said that [PER Sanader  ] has possible involvement in several cases , but the one in which prosecutors have gathered the most evidence involves illegal mediation between his friends and [ORG Hypo  ] Alpe [ORG Adria Bank Group  ] of [LOC Austria  ] . 
The [ORG Hypo Bank  ] case indicates that [PER Sanader  ] allegedly arranged a [ORG DM  ] 4 million loan for his neighbor , [PER Miroslav Kutle  ] , in the 1990’s and received a [ORG DM  ] 800,000 kickback from [PER Kutle  ] in return . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] is cooperating with the anti-corruption prosecutors ( [ORG USKOK  ] ) , and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] story has been corroborated by [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] with knowledge of the transactions . 
The illegal mediation charge for receiving gifts and benefits while abusing an official position to secure business transactions carries a prison term of one to five years . 
[PER Bajic  ] said that [ORG Hypo Bank  ] is cooperating with the investigation. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Sanader  ] is also implicated in several corruption cases involving the [ORG Transportation Ministry  ] . 
Transport Minister [PER Bozidar Kalmeta  ] has been under fire for several months due to corruption cases [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER Bajic  ] said that [PER Sanader  ] often bypassed [PER Kalmeta  ] and gave instructions about how to handle certain cases directly to . 
[PER Bajic  ] did note , however , that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] should have at least been aware of what was happening within [LOC XXXXXXXXXXXX.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Bajic  ] said his office is leading interagency teams established under orders from PM Kosor to deal with five priority cases involving state-owned enterprises ( SOEs ) : [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
The teams , led by the prosecutor’s Office for Suppression of Corruption and [ORG Organized Crime  ] ( [ORG USKOK  ] ) , meet daily and include the Police , [ORG Tax Administration  ] , Finance Police , and other experts . 
[PER Bajic  ] said he believes that all major [MISC Croatian  ] SOEs are now under investigation . 
Chief of Police [PER Oliver Grbic  ] told reporters in mid-January that police were running twelve investigations during the past six months intoXXXXXXXXXXXX management officials of public companies. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) A sixth company under investigation , [ORG Podravka  ] , has 26 percent government ownership , and parliament approves the supervisory board . 
At least seven members of the board , all affiliated with the ruling coalition , were arrested , and Deputy Prime Minister ( and Minister of Economy and former [ORG Podravka  ] executive ) [PER Damir Polancec  ] resigned in October 2009 . 
[PER Dinko Cvitan  ] , head of [ORG USKOK  ] , confirmed to poloff on January 21 that [ORG USKOK  ] has now opened a formal investigation of [PER Polancec  ] for illegal mediation . 
The scandal involves embezzlement and fraudulent loans by several [MISC Podravka-linked  ] firms in an attempt by managers to buy controlling interest in the company . 
[PER Bajic  ] said he needed several documents from [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] in [LOC Hungary  ] to move forward with charges in the case , and initially described efforts to secure them from [LOC Hungary  ] as “catastrophic.” [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and several [MISC Hungarian  ] officials were uncooperative , he said , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
During a January 18 meeting between PM Kosor and [MISC Hungarian  ] PM [PER Bajnai  ] , PM [PER Bajnai  ] told press that documents relating to Podravka’s [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] were sent on to [LOC Croatia  ] on January 15 ; [PER Bajic  ] said he received a [MISC Hungarian  ] prosecutor’s [ORG ZAGREB  ] 00000053 002 OF 002 report on XXXXXXXXXXXX’s dealings with [ORG Podravka  ] on January 22. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) Minister of [ORG Interior  ] [PER Tomislav Karamarko  ] and Minister of Justice [PER Ivan Simonovic  ] have also been spearheading a public relations campaign to publicize the “war on corruption” in [LOC Croatia  ] . 
[PER Simonovic  ] said on [ORG Croatian Radio  ] that “no one can be above the law -- either former or present or future presidents or prime ministers.” He went on to add that “there have always been untouchables , but this is the first time in the history of [LOC Croatia  ] that there won’t be untouchables anymore.” <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) COMMENT: An important test of [LOC Croatia’s  ] anti-corruption efforts will be the ability to go after the biggest fish . 
For several years , [PER Bajic  ] has been extremely hesitant to open even a formal investigation , let alone seek an indictment against high-ranking officials , unless he felt he had a watertight case . 
The opening of the formal investigation against [PER Polancec  ] , and [MISC Bajic’s  ] assessment that the [ORG Hypo Bank  ] case currently has solid evidence against [PER Sanader  ] , are strong signs that some “big fish” may soon face formal charges , joining former [MISC Defense  ] and Interior Minister [PER Berislav Roncevic  ] , who is currently under indictment for a truck procurement scandal during his time at the [PER MoD  ] ( reftel ) . 
While the illegal mediation charges being considered against [PER Sanader  ] and [PER Polancec  ] may seem rather minor , [PER Bajic  ] suggests that there is likely much more to be uncovered involving the former PM . 
In any case , as [PER Bajic  ] likes to point out , [PER Al Capone  ] was brought down for tax evasion rather than for his more notorious activities .
