( C ) Summary . 
In a November 3 meeting , [MISC Dutch  ] PM Cabinet Director [PER Richard van Zwol  ] told [ORG USNATO  ] Ambassador [PER Daalder  ] the [MISC Dutch  ] were in a political deadlock over their [LOC Afghanistan  ] contributions and the Prime Minister was attempting to unlock it . 
He urged the [LOC US  ] to deliver a strong message privately in the next few weeks to help the [MISC DUtch  ] government in its efforts to revise its [LOC Afghanistan  ] policy . 
[PER Van Zwol  ] reassured the Ambassador that media reporting on the November 2 meeting between the [MISC German  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] FMs that suggested the two Allies were pursuing the issue of nuclear weapons forward-basing bilaterally were inaccurate . 
[PER Van Zwel  ] said [MISC Dutch  ] FM [PER Verhagen  ] stressed with his [MISC German  ] counterpart that the debate regarding nuclear weapons on [MISC European  ] soil had to be conducted in the context of [ORG NATO  ] . 
End Summary. --------------------------------- Staying the Course in [LOC Afghanistan  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a frank discussion about the [MISC Dutch  ] contribution to the [ORG ISAF  ] mission , the Ambassador explained to [PER Van Zwol  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] PM Foreign Policy and [ORG Defense Asvisor  ] Karel [PER van Oosterom  ] , and [MISC Dutch  ] Deputy Permanent Representative to [ORG NATO  ] Jan Versteeg that the [LOC United States  ] had not made its final decision about resourcing issues in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , but would stay the course until significant progress was achieved . 
The Ambassador noted that the [LOC United States  ] wanted the [LOC Netherlands  ] to remain as well and would convey strong message to [MISC Dutch  ] leaders in that regard in the month ahead . 
It would be hard to explain a [MISC Dutch  ] withdrawal just as the [LOC US  ] and others were stepping up their contributions to the mission . 
[PER Van Zwol  ] said the [MISC Dutch  ] were in a political deadlock and the Prime Minister was attempting to unlock it . 
He urged the [LOC US  ] to deliver a strong message privately in the next few weeks ; no other type of message would work . 
The [LOC US  ] should emphasize in its discussions with [MISC Dutch  ] leaders that the push now will be on progress in the next 12-18 months , with the view to transferring responsibility to the [MISC Afghans  ] as soon as possible . 
In order to get a positive decision to stay , the [ORG Dutch Labor Party  ] , which is the main stumbling block in the coalition government , would need to be able to point to a new situation to explain any change in policy . 
Greater emphasis on a transfer to [MISC Afghan  ] lead and on moving from combat to training would help , as might the announcement of a new approach by the [PER Obama  ] administration. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Van Zwol  ] and [PER Oosterom  ] confirmed that the [MISC Dutch  ] would not be a lead nation under any circumstances and warned it would be extremely difficult to remain in [LOC Uruzgan  ] . 
The Ambassador said he was hopeful that the [MISC Dutch  ] would keep their troop contributions in the four-digit range , leave their enablers , and send more trainers . 
Pulling out of [LOC Uruzgan  ] , given the [MISC Dutch  ] investment in the province and the [ORG ISAF  ] focus on counter-insurgency , would be a waste of the collective wisdom and trust they had built there over th eyears . 
[PER Van Zwol  ] suggested it was best to focus first on a [MISC Dutch  ] commitment to remain and then discuss where they might deploy. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Van Zwol  ] also advised that , when discussing [LOC Afghanistan  ] with [MISC Dutch  ] Finance Minister [PER Bos  ] , it would be useful for the [LOC United States  ] to make the issue personal for him . 
[PER Van Zwol  ] said [PER Bos  ] would respond well to the idea that remaining in [LOC Afghanistan  ] is an issue of leadership for a Deputy Prime Minister of a party with a proud history . 
[PER Van Zwol  ] also suggested that [PER Bos  ] has future ambitions , and the [LOC United States  ] should point out that he should not lose international credibility by insisting on the [MISC Dutch  ] withdrawal from [LOC Afghanistan  ] at this critical moment. ------------------------ [ORG NATO  ] and [ORG Nuclear Weapons  ] ------------------------ [ORG USNATO  ] 00000501 002 OF 002 <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Daalder  ] used the meeting to ask for clarification on [MISC Dutch  ] FM [PER Verhagen  ] 's November 2 meeting with new [MISC German  ] FM [MISC Westerwelle  ] , and whether the [MISC Dutch  ] were planning a unilateral , bilateral , or trilateral ( with the [MISC Belgians  ] ) effort to remove [LOC US  ] nuclear weapons from [MISC European  ] soil . 
[PER Van Zwol  ] explained that , while a nuclear free world was a matter of personal interest to FM [PER Verhagen  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] would address the issue of forward-basing of [LOC US  ] nuclear weapons in the multilateral context of [ORG NATO  ] only . 
Noting that the [MISC Germans  ] had opened [PER Pandora  ] 's box on the issue of [LOC US  ] nuclear weapons in [LOC Europe  ] , [PER Van Zwol  ] assured the Ambassador there was no [MISC Dutch/Belgian/German  ] cabal to deal with the issue . 
For the past several decades , [ORG NATO  ] Allies had not discussed the issue so as not to rock the boat . 
The new [MISC German  ] coalition agreement changed that , he said , by firmly and openly calling for frank discussions on [ORG NATO  ] 's nuclear weapons policy .
