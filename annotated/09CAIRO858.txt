( C ) Comment: The draft counterterrorism law is not public , and only select [ORG GOE  ] officials are familiar with its contents . 
It is unclear whether it contains human rights improvements over the current [ORG Emergency Law  ] , which allows detention without charge , warrantless searches and wiretapping , and [ORG State Security  ] courts . 
End comment. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG MFA  ] Deputy Director for [ORG Human Rights  ] [PER Omar Shalaby  ] told us that [PER Scheinin  ] held " fruitful discussions " with [ORG GOE  ] officials , members of parliament and the quasi-governmental [ORG National Council for Human Rights  ] ( [ORG NCHR  ] ) , focusing exclusively on [LOC Egypt  ] 's draft counterterrorism law which is intended to replace the [ORG Emergency Law  ] , in force almost continuously since 1967 . 
[PER Shalaby  ] noted that [PER Scheinin  ] met with Minister of [ORG Parliamentary Affairs Mufeed Shehab  ] , Parliament ( [ORG PA  ] ) Speaker [PER Fathi Surour  ] , the chief of the [ORG Supreme Constitutional Court  ] , the prosecutor general , [ORG NCHR  ] Deputy Chairman [PER Kamal Aboulmagd  ] , and senior [ORG MFA  ] and [ORG Interior Ministry  ] officials at the assistant minister level. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 .

[PER Scheinin  ] asked [ORG PA  ] Speaker [PER Surour  ] about a timeframe for the law 's submission to parliament . 
[PER Surour  ] was not able to give a specific timeframe , but said he intends to share the draft law with the public . 
[PER Shalaby  ] told us that the law is still with the [ORG GOE  ] drafting committee , and that the [ORG MFA  ] does not believe the [ORG GOE  ] will submit it to parliament during the current session ending in June . 
[PER Shalaby  ] said that during [PER Scheinin  ] 's meetings , he asked about the draft law 's definitions of terrorism , pre-trial detention and administrative detention , and queried [ORG GOE  ] officials about international agreements on extraordinary rendition . 
[PER Shalaby  ] said [PER Scheinin  ] raised a few issues that went " slightly beyond " the draft [ORG CT  ] law , such as the right to petition the renewable 30-day detentions allowed by the [ORG Emergency Law  ] , and the inspection of prison conditions. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Shalaby  ] said that in his meetings , [PER Scheinin  ] was critical of Article 179 of the [MISC Egyptian  ] Constitution . 
( Note: This article charges the state with " safeguarding security...in the face of the dangers of terrorism , " and notes that government counterterrorism measures " cannot be hampered by " other constitutional articles requiring judges or the Public Prosecutor to order detentions , and prohibiting warrantless searches and wiretapping . 
End note . 
) According to [PER Shalaby  ] , [PER Scheinin  ] also reiterated " comments " from his 2006 report . 
( Note: The [ORG Special Rapporteur  ] 's 2006 report notes that the [ORG Emergency Law  ] allows detention without charge , and criticizes [ORG State Security  ] courts as " not independent . 
" End note . 
) [PER Shalaby  ] said the [ORG GOE  ] would allow the visit of another [ORG UN  ] special rapporteur in June or July . 
Although [PER Shalaby  ] would not specify which rapporteur , he hinted that it would [LOC CAIRO  ] 00000858 002 OF 002 be a rapporteur dealing with economic , social and cultural rights. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies  ] ( [ORG CIHRS  ] ) hosted [PER Scheinin  ] for a three-hour meeting with 11 [MISC Egyptian  ] [ORG NGOs  ] in advance of his consultations with the [ORG GOE  ] and parliament . 
[ORG CIHRS  ] Director [PER Bahey Al-Din Hassan  ] told us that the [ORG NGOs  ] delivered presentations on the draft counterterrorism law leaked to the independent newspaper " [MISC Al-Masry Al-Youm  ] " in February 2008 , and discussed specific cases of detainees being " abused " under The [ORG Emergency Law  ] . 
( Note: Per ref C , the [ORG MFA  ] told us in May 2008 that the leaked draft was not accurate . 
End note . 
) [PER Hassan  ] said that [PER Scheinin  ] asked questions regarding the presentations , but did not discuss the points he planned to raise with the [ORG GOE  ] and parliament . 
[PER Soha Abdelatty  ] , Deputy Director of the [ORG Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights  ] , who attended the meeting , told us that the NGO presentations focused on how counterterrorism measures currently impact the freedom of expression and association , and labor rights . 
[PER Abdelatty  ] said that [PER Scheinin  ] expressed particular concern with [ORG GOE  ] surveillance of [MISC Egyptian  ] citizens , access to phone records , and interception of communications. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) [PER Scheinin  ] issued a press statement following his visit thanking the [ORG GOE  ] for its cooperation and for the " open and extensive discussions " he conducted with " key stakeholders " regarding counterterrorism . 
The statement lists [PER Scheinin  ] 's meetings with specific [ORG GOE  ] officials and parliamentarians , and makes note of his consultations with civil society . 
It concludes: " The willingness of the government to discuss the challenging subject of upholding human rights while countering terrorism is most encouraging . 
I will continue my dialogue with [LOC Egypt  ] with a view to submitting a full public report on its counter-terrorism law and practice by the end of 2009 . 
The report , which will contain a set of findings and recommendations , will then be considered by a future session of the [ORG Human Rights Council  ] . 
In this context , I discussed with authorities my wish to visit [LOC Egypt  ] again in the near future for the purpose of finalizing my report .
