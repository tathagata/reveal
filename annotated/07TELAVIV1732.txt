Jones  ] . 
Reasons: 1.4 ( b ) ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) SUMMARY: In a June 11 meeting that entailed discussion of the benchmarks ( reftel ) , [ORG Israeli Security Agency  ] ( [ORG ISA  ] ) Head [PER Yuval Diskin  ] shared his assessment of the current situation in the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] and [LOC West Bank  ] , painting a picture of a desperate , disorganized , and demoralized [PER Fatah  ] in the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] , versus a well-organized and ascendant [ORG Hamas  ] . 
Speaking before the dramatic events of June 12-13 in [LOC Gaza  ] , [PER Diskin  ] qualified that [ORG Hamas  ] is currently not in a position to completely destroy [PER Fatah  ] . 
[PER Diskin  ] said that he opposes [ORG USSC LTG Dayton  ] 's proposal to equip security forces loyal to [ORG Palestinian Authority President Abbas  ] and [PER Fatah  ] , as he is concerned that the provisions will end up in the hands of [ORG Hamas  ] . 
He claimed that the security forces loyal to [ORG Abbas  ] and [PER Fatah  ] have been penetrated by [ORG Hamas  ] , and pointed to a recent incident in which [ORG Hamas  ] reportedly seized heavy machine guns from [ORG Abbas' Presidential Guard  ] . 
[PER Diskin  ] noted that the failed hostage-taking attempt two days earlier at the [MISC Kissufim  ] crossing had been carried out by [ORG Palestinian Islamic Jihad  ] ( [ORG PIJ  ] ) and [ORG Al-Aksa Martyrs Brigades  ] militants , and led by [ORG PIJ  ] . 
He said that [ORG ISA  ] had no prior information about the attack , and described it as " operationally creative . 
" [PER Diskin  ] said that overall counter-tunnel cooperation with [MISC Egyptian  ] security forces has improved over the last two months , but claimed that that the [MISC Egyptians  ] still only react to intelligence supplied by [ORG ISA  ] , and are otherwise not proactive. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) SUMMARY , [PER CONT.: Diskin  ] described the overall security situation in the [LOC West Bank  ] as comparatively better , and praised the level of cooperation [ORG ISA  ] receives from the [MISC Palestinian  ] security services operating in the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
That said , he lamented what he characterized as a crisis of leadership in [PER Fatah  ] , with [ORG PA President Abbas  ] already focusing on his retirement , and his possible successors incapable of leading the [MISC Palestinians  ] in both the [LOC West Bank  ] and the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] . 
[PER Diskin  ] especially criticized [ORG PA National Security Advisor  ] Muhammad [PER Dahlan  ] as attempting to lead his loyalists in the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] by " remote control " from abroad . 
[PER Diskin  ] said that [PER Fatah  ] is on its " last legs , " and that the situation bodes ill for [LOC Israel  ] . 
He noted his intention to discuss some ideas on how to deal with the situation with PM [PER Olmert  ] in the near future , and said he would share his thoughts afterwards with the Ambassador . 
END SUMMARY. --------------------------------------------- ------------ [PER DISKIN  ] DESCRIBES SITUATION FOR [PER FATAH  ] IN [MISC GAZA AS DESPERATE  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) Speaking before the dramatic events of June 12-13 , [PER Diskin  ] said that [ORG Hamas  ] is dominant in the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] , but is not yet strong enough there to completely destroy [PER Fatah  ] . 
The difference , he explained , is between the " quality " of [ORG Hamas  ] , and the " quantity " of [PER Fatah  ] 's security apparatus that is loyal to [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] ( [ORG PA  ] ) President [PER Abbas  ] . 
[ORG Hamas  ] is dominant in most areas . 
In the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] , it can win every fight with [PER Fatah  ] , but [PER Fatah  ] can do it harm in its " chaotic " way of fighting . 
[PER Diskin  ] said that some [PER Fatah  ] members are being paid by [ORG National Security Advisor  ] Muhammad [PER Dahlan  ] , while others are being paid by [PER Abbas  ] -- especially the [ORG Presidential Guard  ] . 
He noted that the [ORG Presidential Guard  ] had been involved in the June 10 clashes at the [LOC Rafah  ] crossing. --------------------------------------------- ------------- BUT NOTES HE OPPOSES PLAN TO SUPPORT [ORG FATAH SECURITY FORCES  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER Diskin  ] noted that he had heard earlier on June 11 from [MISC Palestinian  ] sources that [ORG Hamas  ] had succeeded in stealing some " [MISC Doshka  ] " heavy machine guns from the [ORG Presidential Guard  ] . 
He said that this is an example of why he does not support " at this time " [ORG USSC LTG Dayton  ] 's proposal to supply ammunition and weapons to [MISC Fatah:  ] " I support the idea of militarily strengthening [PER Fatah  ] , but I am afraid that they are not organized to ensure that the equipment that is transferred to them will reach the intended recipients . 
" [PER Diskin  ] claimed that most of the [MISC Fatah-aligned  ] security forces have been penetrated by [ORG Hamas  ] . 
He reiterated that he does not want to see any equipment transferred to them before he is convinced that the equipment will arrive at its intended destination. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) [PER Diskin  ] raised as another matter the question of whether [PER Fatah  ] will be able to hold on to any equipment provided to it . 
He expressed concern about [PER Fatah  ] 's organizational capabilities , and what he characterized as a TEL AVIV 00001732 002 OF 003 glaring lack of leadership: " [PER Dahlan  ] is trying to manage [PER Fatah  ] 's security forces by remote control . 
We are not even sure where he is . 
" ( [PER NOTE: Diskin  ] 's aide said he believed [PER Dahlan  ] is in [LOC Cairo  ] . 
But on June 13 , [PER Diskin  ] told the Ambassador that [PER Dahlan  ] had surfaced in [LOC Amman  ] the day before . 
END NOTE . 
) [PER Diskin  ] continued: " [PER Fatah  ] is in very bad shape in the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] . 
We have received requests to train their forces in [LOC Egypt  ] and [LOC Yemen  ] . 
We would like them to get the training they need , and to be more powerful , but they do not have anyone to lead them . 
" [PER Diskin  ] also made clear his reservations on training [MISC Palestinians  ] in a country like [LOC Yemen  ] with a strong [ORG Al-Qaida  ] presence. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) [PER Diskin  ] 's aide said that the security forces at the [LOC Rafah  ] crossing are strong , but are demoralized with the overall situation in the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] . 
[PER Diskin  ] added that their communications with the [ORG ISA  ] had become " desperate , " and indicated no hope for the future . 
He observed that there is a young generation of leaders among [PER Fatah  ] who are being " pushed " by [PER Dahlan  ] and who have a sense of the urgency of the situation and what needs to be done . 
At the same time , however , they are not behaving in a way that is to be expected by people in their urgent situation . 
[PER Diskin  ] observed , " They are approaching a zero-sum situation , and yet they ask us to attack [ORG Hamas  ] . 
This is a new development . 
We have never seen this before . 
They are desperate . 
" --------------------------------------------- ----- DISKIN: SITUATION IN [LOC WEST BANK  ] BETTER THAN IN [LOC GAZA  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) In the [LOC West Bank  ] , [PER Diskin  ] said that [ORG ISA  ] has established a very good working relationship with the [ORG Preventive Security Organization  ] ( [ORG PSO  ] ) and the [ORG General Intelligence Organization  ] ( [ORG GIO  ] ) . 
[PER Diskin  ] said that the [ORG PSO  ] shares with [ORG ISA  ] almost all the intelligence that it collects . 
They understand that [LOC Israel  ] 's security is central to their survival in the struggle with [ORG Hamas  ] in the [LOC West Bank.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) While he described this overall relationship with the [MISC Palestinian  ] security services in the [LOC West Bank  ] as healthy , [PER Diskin  ] noted that [PER Fatah  ] did not react to the last set of [ORG Hamas  ] attacks in the [LOC West Bank  ] due to the current " mood " of [ORG GIO  ] leader [PER Tawfik Tirawi  ] . 
[PER Diskin  ] explained that [PER Tirawi  ] ( whom he described as psychopathic , cruel , dangerous and prone to extreme mood swings ) is disaffected and feels that his status has declined , and that he is no longer respected by [PER Abbas  ] . 
[PER Diskin  ] claimed that [PER Tirawi  ] also feels that his relationship with [PER Dahlan  ] has deteriorated . 
[PER Diskin  ] said that he hopes to meet with [PER Tirawi  ] the week of June 17 to dissuade him from " doing stupid things , as he is trying to develop ties with the [MISC Dughmush  ] family in the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] . 
" --------------------------------------------- ------------- [PER DISKIN  ] ON ABBAS: HE HAS FAILED . 
NOBODY CAN LEAD [PER FATAH  ] NOW --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) [PER Diskin  ] said that [PER Abbas  ] views [PER Fatah  ] as weak and " on its last legs , " and incapable of being rehabilitated within six months . 
Stressing that it was his own opinion ( and not necessarily shared by the [ORG GOI  ] ) , [PER Diskin  ] said that [PER Abbas  ] is starting to become a problem for [MISC Israel:  ] " He 's a paradox . 
He cannot function and do anything . 
Why is [PER Fatah  ] failing ? 
Because [PER Abbas  ] has become the 'good guy' whom everyone is trying to do everything for in order to keep him alive . 
Everyone is afraid of the alternative , and yet [PER Abbas  ] is already talking about how he plans to retire from the political scene after his term ends in 2008 . 
He knows he is weak and that he has failed . 
He has failed to rehabilitate [PER Fatah  ] . 
He did not start to take any action when he had the chance in 2004 . 
Instead of choosing to be the leader for [PER Fatah  ] , he chose to be a national leader for all [MISC Palestinians  ] . 
" [PER Diskin  ] lamented that the current situation suggests that nobody can now assume leadership of [PER Fatah  ] . 
[PER Dahlan  ] , he said , can only lead in the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] -- if that -- and [PER Marwan Barghouti  ] can lead in the [LOC West Bank  ] , but not the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] . 
" It is something in their blood , " he said , " the leaders of the [LOC West Bank  ] cannot rule the [MISC Palestinians  ] in the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] and vice versa . 
" [PER Diskin  ] warned that [MISC Palestinian  ] society is disintegrating , and that this bodes ill for [LOC Israel  ] . 
He said that he has some ideas about how to address this that he wishes to discuss with PM [PER Olmert  ] , and would share with the Ambassador afterwards: " We have to give [PER Fatah  ] the conditions to succeed , but we cannot do this through your benchmarks ( reftel ) . 
" --------------------------------------------- ---------- [PER DISKIN  ] ON [ORG ISA  ] COUNTER-TUNNEL COOPERATION WITH EGYPTIANS --------------------------------------------- ---------- TEL AVIV 00001732 003 OF 003 <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) Responding to a question from the Ambassador , [PER Diskin  ] said that cooperation between [MISC Egyptian  ] and [MISC Palestinian  ] security forces recently led to the discovery of some tunnels in the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] . 
He said the [ORG ISA  ] occasionally hears that tunnels are found in the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] , and while he is inclined to believe the information , he admitted that [ORG ISA  ] cannot always verify it . 
[PER Diskin  ] said that [ORG ISA  ] 's cooperation with [MISC Egyptian  ] security services has improved over the last two months after their respective delegations had met . 
That said , he claimed that fundamental challenges remain unresolved: " They react on the intelligence that we provide to them , but they are not proactive . 
" He lamented that there has been no dramatic change in the tunnel situation , adding that there are still many tunnels running under the [MISC Philadelphi  ] corridor. --------------------------------------------- ------------- [PER DISKIN  ] ON THE FAILED ATTACK AT [LOC KISSUFIM  ] ; THREATS ON [PER FAYYAD  ] --------------------------------------------- ------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) Referring to the failed June 9 attempt by [MISC Palestinian  ] militants to kidnap [MISC Israeli  ] soldiers stationed at the [LOC Kissufim  ] crossing between [LOC Israel  ] and the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] , [PER Diskin  ] said that [ORG Palestinian Islamic Jihad  ] ( [ORG PIJ  ] ) and [ORG Al-Aksa Martyrs Brigades  ] carried out the attempt under [ORG PIJ  ] leadership . 
He said that the militant who guided the attack was one of [ORG PIJ  ] 's main operatives in the northern [LOC Gaza Strip  ] . 
[PER Diskin  ] said that the attack was staged against an empty post , but designed to appear dramatic . 
He admitted the attackers were operationally very creative , and that [ORG ISA  ] had no indication that the attack was going to take place: " This was another [ORG ISA  ] failure . 
We had no intelligence on the attack in advance . 
" <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) Responding to the Ambassador 's question , [PER Diskin  ] said that he had not seen any specific evidence about threats to [ORG PA  ] Finance Minister [PER Salam Fayyad  ] . 
He observed , however , that as a former [PER Fatah  ] activist , [PER Fayyad  ] ought to be concerned about his own security . 
[PER Diskin  ] noted that the man thrown by [ORG Hamas  ] militants from the roof of a 15-story building in the [LOC Gaza Strip  ] the day before was a member of [ORG Force  ] 17. ********************************************* ******************** Visit Embassy [LOC Tel Aviv  ] 's Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/telaviv You can also access this site through the [ORG State Department  ] 's Classified SIPRNET website. ********************************************* ******************** JONES ...</pre></code>
