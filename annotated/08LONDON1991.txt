( [ORG C/NF  ] ) Summary . 
As [PER Gordon Brown  ] lurches from political disaster to disaster , [LOC Westminster  ] is abuzz with speculation about whether he will be replaced as Prime Minister and [ORG Labour  ] Parxty leader , and , if so , by whom . 
Right now , Foreign Secretary [PER David Miliband  ] and Justice Secretary [PER Jack Straw  ] are the two most frequently mentioned , and likely , successors -- [PER Miliband  ] as the “Labour [PER David Cameron”  ] to represent the [MISC Blairite  ] wing of the party or [PER Straw  ] as a [ORG Labour  ] elder statesman to bind the [ORG Party together  ] . 
Other credible names in circulation , in Post’s view , are [PER Brown  ] confidante Secretary of State for Children and Schools [PER Ed Balls  ] , [ORG House of Commons Labour  ] Leader [PER Harriet Harman  ] , Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [PER James Purnell  ] , and Health Secretary [PER Alan Johnston  ] . 
These would-be successors are a diverse group , but they all have one thing in common: unless [PER Brown  ] steps down voluntarily , which is highly unlikely , one of them will have to mount a public challenge to [PER Brown  ] , and none of the candidates has so far been willing to wield the knife - or at least not yet . 
End summary . 
Talk of Ousting [PER Brown  ] Reaching [MISC Fever Pitch ------------------------------------------  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) A terrible by-election defeat in [LOC Scotland  ] on July 23 , in which a formerly rock-solid [ORG Labour  ] seat with a 13,000 majority fell to the [ORG Scottish National Party  ] ( [ORG Ref  ] A ) , has left the [ORG Labour Party  ] reeling and fueled fears among [MISC MPs  ] that [MISC Brown’s  ] leadership of the party , and his premiership , may now be beyond repair . 
For the first time in Labour’s eleven-year reign , [ORG Labour  ] [MISC MPs  ] are experiencing what it is to be truly unpopular and fear they are facing meltdown at the next election , which must be held no later than June 2010 . 
According to a July 28 [ORG YouGov  ] poll , if a general election were called now , the [MISC Tories  ] would receive 46 percent of the vote , while [ORG Labour  ] would take just 26 percent and the [ORG Liberal Democrat Party  ] 17 percent ; 74 percent of respondent said they were dissatisfied with [MISC Brown’s  ] performance as PM . 
In this febrile atmosphere , [LOC Westminster  ] is buzzing with news that dissident [MISC MPs  ] are canvassing their colleagues to find a new leader , while at the same time Cabinet ministers are lining up to warn [MISC MPs  ] to stop plotting and unite behind [PER Brown  ] ( [ORG Ref  ] A ) . 
While rumors have been afloat for several months , our contacts tell us now that those considering getting rid of [PER Brown  ] are no longer confined to a small rump of bitter ex-Ministers , such as [PER Charles Clark  ] ( [ORG Ref  ] B ) . 
With no sign yet that [PER Brown  ] has a clear plan to turn the party’s woes around , commentators wonder if he can hold out until 2010 , and are already turning their attention to who might replace him . 
How Would It Happen ? -------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) There are two ways to oust [PER Brown  ] . 
First , he could step down on his own , perhaps at the behest of a group of close advisors and party elders . 
We judge this possibility to be extremely unlikely ; [PER Brown  ] has wanted [LOC Downing Street  ] for too long to go quietly - a point [LOC London  ] Mayor [PER Boris Johnson  ] , a [MISC Conservative  ] , made in a widely-read op-ed piece earlier this week . 
Second , another candidate for party leader could force a leadership election by identifying him- or herself publicly and producing the names of 20 percent of sitting [MISC MPs  ] ( 70 of 346 [ORG Labour  ] [MISC MPs  ] ) who support his/her candidacy . 
[ORG Labour  ] would then hold an election at its party conference for a new leader , in which [PER Brown  ] could conceivably run himself to regain the leadership . 
In the event of a leadership election , one-third of the vote would be allocated to [MISC MPs  ] ; one-third to [ORG Labour Party  ] members ; and one-third to the trade unions . 
Many [MISC MPs  ] have told us that , regardless of the scenario , they candidly hope a change in leadership is still a long way off . 
They acknowledge - as [ORG Labour  ] Deputy Whip [PER Nick Brown  ] did to us just days after the [LOC Glasgow  ] election -- that changing PM for the third time in 18 months could lead to calls for an immediate general election , which would be hard to ignore and would not give [ORG Labour  ] the time it needs to recover under a new leader . 
When Would It Happen ? --------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) Before the catastrophic July 23 by-election defeat , uppermost on [MISC MPs  ] , minds was heading home for the summer recess . 
The fact that Parliament is now out until [LOC LONDON  ] 00001991 002 OF 005 early October gives [PER Brown  ] some breathing space . 
On the other hand , [ORG Labour  ] [MISC MPs  ] now have a lengthy period to hear out their constituents’ wrath while gnawing over the problem of their party’s collapsing popularity and their leader’s seeming inability to turn its fortunes around . 
There is rampant speculation by media and pundits alike that a move against [PER Brown  ] will occur before the party meets for its annual conference at the end of September - early September 2006 was when the plot that eventually forced then-PM [PER Blair  ] to announce a date for his departure from [LOC Downing Street  ] took place . 
While that scenario still remains highly unlikely , another possibility rapidly gaining credence among [LOC Westminster  ] watchers has [ORG Labour  ] replacing [PER Brown  ] closer to a general election in 2009 or 2010 , thus giving a new leader a few months time to settle in and get the party’s poll ratings back up . 
The Candidates -------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) In the order of frequency , and Post’s assessment of their credibility as potential successors , below are the names we are hearing most often from [ORG Labour Party  ] contacts and from [LOC UK  ] media observers: [PER David Miliband  ] -------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) Foreign Secretary [PER David Miliband  ] is a high-flying young member of the Government whose name inevitably tops “future leader” lists , with some going as far as to call him [ORG Labour  ] , s “heir apparent.” A former [PER Kennedy Scholar  ] , [PER Miliband  ] at 42 years of age has been at the center of power for a long time , serving as [PER Blair  ] , s [ORG Head of Policy  ] from 1994 to 2001 before winning a seat in [LOC Parliament.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [ORG Miliband’s  ] appointment as Foreign Secretary in June 2007 makes him the second-youngest [LOC UK  ] Foreign Secretary ever . 
His appointment came as a surprise to many who had expected [PER Brown  ] to purge the cabinet of so-called “Blairites.” [ORG Miliband’s  ] fortitude is widely viewed as a testament to how successfully he has bridged the [MISC Blairite/Brownite  ] division that still hamper the [ORG Labour Party  ] . 
He steers clear of well-known [PER Blairite  ] rabble rousers [PER Charles Clarke  ] , [PER Alan Milburn  ] and [PER John Reid  ] , all of whom are suspected of trying to unseat [PER Brown  ] , and resisted pressure from “Blairites” to stand against [PER Brown  ] before last year , s leadership handover . 
More Machiavellian voices within the [ORG Labour Party  ] say that [PER Brown  ] gave [PER Miliband  ] the high profile job of Foreign Secretary not as a reward for his loyalty , but as a way of keeping [PER Miliband  ] removed from domestic politics where he might start to build up an alternative power base for any future job vacancy. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER Miliband  ] certainly has the most high-profile portfolio of all [MISC Brown’s  ] would-be successors . 
Added to that , his [ORG Labour  ] credentials are impeccable and his intellect unquestioned . 
Some consider [PER Miliband  ] , whose nickname at [LOC Number 10  ] was “egghead , ” as too brainy to be leader . 
Rumor has it that he has entered into an electoral pact with Cabinet colleague and another would-be successor [PER James Purnell  ] ( see para . 
15 ) , who reportedly told [PER Miliband  ] he would stand aside in order to give [PER Miliband  ] his full backing. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) Long viewed as too young or too reticent to challenge [PER Brown  ] , [PER Miliband  ] may be changing this perception . 
An op-ed piece he published in the July 29 Guardian , in which he laid out his ideas of how [ORG Labour  ] can still win the next election , has triggered wide-spread media speculation that he is positioning himself at long last as a possible successor . 
In the op-ed , [PER Miliband  ] was careful not to criticize [PER Brown  ] - but neither did he call for party unity behind the PM , and [PER Miliband  ] is canny enough to know how this omission would be interpreted . 
[ORG Miliband’s Principal Private  ] Secretary told us July 30 that [LOC Downing Street  ] had “been told in advance about the article” and explained that the op-ed piece reflected that [PER Miliband  ] is “concerned and doing a lot of thinking about the party’s standing , ” but said the Foreign Secretary was not the kind of man to “plot behind someone’s back on his own.” The [ORG PPS  ] declined to respond when asked if that meant the Foreign Secretary was the kind of man who might join a delegation of plotters who ask the Prime Minister to step down for the good of the party . 
[PER Jack Straw  ] ---------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) Could the party unite around caretaker leader [PER Jack Straw  ] , a wise old man of the party ? 
In the wake of the [LOC LONDON  ] 00001991 003 OF 005 July 23 by-election meltdown , the media was awash with rumors that 62-year-old [PER Straw  ] , currently the Justice Secretary , was being lined up by disgruntled [ORG Labour  ] [MISC MPs  ] to confront [PER Brown  ] and force him to quit before taking over as caretaker leader of the party while a younger replacement is groomed . 
After [PER Gordon Brown  ] himself , [PER Straw  ] is the second most senior member of the Cabinet , having previously served as both Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary , holding the latter post during the September 11 terrorist attacks and overseeing the beginning of military action in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Outwardly an amiable and affable man , [PER Straw  ] is viewed with less affection by some cabinet colleagues who say they have been at the receiving end of his whispering campaigns regarding their abilities . 
Critics are also quick to note that he was one of the first of [PER Blair  ] , s closest allies to jump ship in favor of [PER Gordon Brown  ] when he sensed the political winds were shifting in [PER Brown  ] , s direction. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) Over the July 26-27 weekend , [PER Straw  ] interrupted his [LOC U.S.  ] holiday following widespread rumors that his supporters were collecting names of [MISC MPs  ] to force [PER Brown  ] into a leadership challenge , announcing that he remains “absolutely convinced” that [PER Brown  ] is “the right man to be leading the [ORG Labour Party.” Despite  ] his public endorsement of the PM , No 10 advisors are reportedly enraged by the actions of [PER Straw  ] , s supporters who they suspect of organizing a coup , with or without Straw’s active participation . 
[PER Ed Balls  ] -------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) Super bright , relatively young , [PER Ed Balls  ] , now Secretary of State for Children , Schools and Families , has seen his star rise and fall in recent years but remains a credible front-runner to succeed [PER Brown  ] . 
Since becoming an [ORG MP  ] in 2005 , he has enjoyed a meteoric political rise into the Cabinet in only 3 years , not least because of his close friendship with [PER Brown  ] . 
[PER Brown  ] plucked [PER Balls  ] out of his job as an economist at the [ORG Financial Times  ] and installed him as a senior advisor in 1994 . 
[PER Balls  ] became [PER Brown  ] , s most trusted lieutenant at the [ORG Treasury  ] , where he was unofficially known as the Deputy [LOC Chancellor.  ] , He continues to remain [PER Brown  ] , s closest confidante , and it is an open secret according to [ORG Labour  ] party contacts that [PER Balls  ] is [PER Brown  ] , s choice as his successor - a charge [PER Balls  ] vehemently denies . 
He is married to another [ORG Labour  ] high-flying minister , [PER Yvette Cooper.  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) While his financial credentials and close relationship to [PER Brown  ] weigh in his favor , [PER Balls  ] has performed badly as Schools Secretary and is accused of shirking responsibility for the failings of his department ( the most recent blow to his reputation was a delay in reporting standardized test scores to [LOC UK  ] schoolchildren , which [PER Balls  ] at first publicly minimized then belatedly apologized for ) . 
Critics point out that since coming out from the shadows and entering the public arena , [PER Balls  ] has shown himself to be less than suited to the top job: his public speaking is derided as “dull , ” his slightly awkward manner as “charmless , ” and he has many enemies within the party , precisely because of his relationship with the PM . 
Party insiders accuse him of cowardice because he tells [PER Brown  ] what he thinks [PER Brown  ] wants to hear . 
It is this close relationship that may make a leadership challenge difficult for [PER Balls  ] , since of all the would-be successors , [PER Balls  ] will face the harshest criticism if he turns on his mentor . 
On the other hand , in the unlikely event that [PER Brown  ] steps aside voluntarily , [PER Balls  ] might very well catapult to the top of the possible successors . 
[PER Harriet Harman  ] -------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) Deputy Leader [PER Harriet Harman  ] , the only woman mentioned as a possible successor , is a relative policy light weight but an adept inter-party operator . 
A Brownite , she has reportedly been discreetly attempting to gauge how much support she has among Parliamentary colleagues ever since [MISC Brown’s  ] star started to wane earlier this year . 
[PER Harman  ] faces a rough ride with most of the [LOC UK  ] media , especially the more widely read tabloids who criticize her aggressive championing of women , s rights and say that she is obsessed with political correctness . 
On July 29 [PER Harman  ] had to publicly deny reports that she told her aides , “This is my moment ( to rule ) , ” following the July 23 by-election disaster . 
She has recently begun to speak on the need for the party to underscore its commitment to equality and fairness , which may be a sign of her reaching out to the party’s anti-Blairite , [LOC LONDON  ] 00001991 004 OF 005 left wing . 
[PER James Purnell  ] ------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [ORG Work and Pensions  ] Secretary [PER James Purnell  ] is another strong candidate , although he is often described as [ORG Labour  ] , s “next leader but one.” Like many of the other contenders , 38-year-old [PER Purnell  ] was one of [PER Blair  ] , s closest advisers at [MISC Number Ten  ] before entering [ORG Parliament  ] in 2001 . 
[PER Purnell  ] is already a darling of the [LOC UK  ] media , having taken on [LOC Britain  ] , s so-called “benefit cheats” by announcing plans for the long-term unemployed to retrain and take on work. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [PER Purnell  ] , s political radar is finely honed and colleagues describe him as astute and able . 
He went to work for [PER Blair  ] when [PER Blair  ] was a relatively unknown [ORG MP  ] in the late 1980s ; now , after just a year in the cabinet , [PER Purnell  ] has gained a reputation for handling difficult briefs with aplomb , although he is sometimes criticized for coming across as smug . 
[PER Purnell  ] may have support within [ORG Parliament  ] , but he lacks a strong constituency base outside [LOC Westminster  ] - crucial for any successful party leader . 
Because [PER Purnell  ] was “parachuted” into a safe parliamentary seat , he has no local ties and therefore limited local backing ; and because he is not from a trade union background , he also can , t count on the support of union leaders , who aren’t impressed with his planned social security cuts . 
[PER Alan Johnson  ] ------------ <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) For many in the [ORG Labour Party  ] , Health Secretary [PER Alan Johnson  ] pushes all the right personal buttons . 
Born into poverty , orphaned , and married with two kids by the age of 18 , [PER Johnson  ] went on to become the boss of one of the [LOC UK  ] , s biggest trade unions - the [ORG Communication Workers Union  ] - where he worked his way up from postman to union baron . 
[PER Johnson  ] , who has a reputation as an inclusive and collegiate boss and is most often described as “amiable , ” is happy to let junior ministers in his department shine rather than taking their ideas or their limelight - but it is this lack of killer instinct that , commentators note , make [PER Johnson  ] more suitable to serve as a deputy prime minister , rather than for the top job itself in which he has shown remarkably little interest . 
[PER Andy Burnham  ] ------------ <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) On paper , Secretary of State for Culture , Media and [ORG Sport  ] [PER Andy Burnham  ] , s rise through the party mirrors that of [PER James Purnell  ] . 
At 38 years old , [PER Burnham  ] has only been an [ORG MP  ] since 2001 , following a career as a special advisor to PM [PER Tony Blair  ] . 
He is also another “Blairite” who , like [MISC Miliband  ] , successfully survived the cull when [PER Brown  ] became PM . 
[PER Burnham  ] is a dark horse favorite among [ORG Labour  ] members . 
The [MISC Cambridge-educated  ] father-of-three has a common touch his rivals envy and is married to his university sweetheart , [PER Dutch-born Marie-France  ] . 
[PER Jon Cruddas  ] ----------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) [ORG MP  ] for [ORG Dagenham Jon Crudas  ] is a wild card . 
Although not well known outside the party , he fought a brilliant campaign in last year , s [ORG Labour  ] deputy leader contest , eventually losing out to [PER Harriet Harman  ] , but not before winning the crucial backing of some of the country , s biggest trade unions as well as the endorsement of [ORG Labour  ] , s “Tribune” magazine . 
[PER Cruddas  ] , elected to [ORG Parliament  ] in 2001 , has already shown himself to be a highly astute and wily politician . 
Prior to becoming an [ORG MP  ] , [PER Cruddas  ] was one of [PER Blair  ] , s closest advisors , working as his deputy political secretary at [LOC Downing Street  ] where he was responsible for the Government , s relations with the trade unions . 
On becoming an [ORG MP  ] , [PER Cruddas  ] cleverly began to disassociate himself from [PER Blair  ] , rebelling against the Government on key issues , opposing the Government’s initiatives to pay for university education , more rights for asylum seekers , and the renewal of the [LOC UK  ] Trident nuclear submarine system . 
He has described himself as “mistaken” over his decision to vote for [MISC British  ] participation in the 2003 [LOC Iraq  ] conflict . 
One of [PER Cruddas  ] , biggest assets is his wife , fellow party activist [PER Anna Healy  ] , who has worked for many of [ORG Labour  ] , s best known cabinet ministers in recent years . 
However , [PER Cruddas  ] - who is believed to have turned down ministerial roles from both [LOC LONDON  ] 00001991 005 OF 005 [PER Blair  ] and [PER Brown  ] - may find that his lack of previous any ministerial experience counts against him . 
[PER John Hutton  ] ----------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) 53-year-old Business Secretary [PER John Hutton  ] was until recently seen as another strong contender - until he upset the powerful and influential trade unions by arguing earlier this year that the [LOC UK  ] should “celebrate the fact that people can be enormously wealthy in this country.” The unions were further infuriated when [PER Hutton  ] said the Government had reached “the end of the era” on considering new regulations , although this sentiment has earned [PER Hutton  ] the respect of the business community , who see him as a key ally . 
The unions now say there has been a complete breakdown of trust , and have called on [PER Hutton  ] to be removed from his post in any [PER Brown  ] government reshuffle ( widely expected in September as part of the Prime Minister’s effort to re-energize his political standing ) . 
These requests put Prime Minister [PER Brown  ] in a difficult position - he would look weak were he to move [PER Hutton  ] ; the answer may be to move him to another cabinet spot , such as the next Defense Secretary. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) While union fury won’t particularly bother [PER Hutton  ] , who has always been to the right of the [ORG Labour Party  ] and one of [PER Tony Blair  ] , s closest allies , a lack of union support would stop any leadership challenge he might be considering . 
[PER Hutton  ] has told us in confidence that he is fed up with government work and considering standing down at the next election to go into the private sector . 
Comment------- <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [ORG C/NF  ] ) Given the improbability that [PER Brown  ] will step down voluntarily , the chances of any one of this group of would-be successors , or any dark horses that might emerge , taking over before the scheduled election in 2010 depends on one of them challenging [PER Brown  ] openly for the party leadership . 
So far , none of them have been willing to wield the knife , most likely afraid that such a move would cause a party split that would in the end be an even greater fiasco for [ORG Labour  ] . 
We don’t see a clear tipping point on the horizon - but given [MISC Brown’s  ] abysmal track record over the last year , that day could come when [ORG Labour  ] MPs return from vacations in late August/early September .
