End Summary <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) During an October 21 meeting with [ORG MFA Undersecretary Sinirlioglu  ] , the Ambassador challenged PM [PER Erdogan  ] 's public statement , made the previous day while he was in [LOC Tehran  ] , dismissing allegations of [LOC Iran  ] 's intent to acquire nuclear weapons as " gossip . 
" Holding a copy of President [PER Obama  ] 's [LOC Pittsburgh Summit  ] comdemnation of [LOC Iraq  ] 's nuclear ambitions , the Ambassador asked [PER Sinirlioglu  ] if " this was the 'gossip' " to which [PER Erdogan  ] had referred . 
The Ambassador emphasized that [PER Erdogan  ] 's statement made [LOC Turkey  ] vulnerable to international community criticism should [LOC Iran  ] balk on [ORG IAEA  ] inspection of its [LOC Qom  ] reprocessing facility or second-party reprocessing of its low-enriched uranium stockpile . 
[PER Erdogan  ] was , in effect , allowing the [MISC Iranians  ] to infer a weakening of the international community consensus against them . 
The Ambassador warned [PER Sinirlioglu  ] that [LOC Washington  ] was now wondering if it could any longer count on [LOC Turkey  ] to help contain [LOC Iran  ] 's profound challenge to regional peace and stability. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Implying [PER Erdogan  ] 's use of the term " gossip " was unconfirmed , [PER Sinirlioglu  ] claimed that the [MISC Turkish  ] government " fully supports the [MISC P5-plus-1  ] . 
" He asserted the prime minister 's principled opposition to nuclear weapons in the region . 
He argued [PER Erdogan  ] 's rhetoric is a tactical effort to gain him credibility with the [MISC Middle Eastern  ] street so he can better place the anti-nuclear weapons message . 
Though [LOC Turkey  ] " doesn't believe in sanctions , " [PER Sinirlioglu  ] said , " we will support consensus " in the [ORG Security Council  ] . 
The Ambassador responded that [LOC Iran  ] would be the single most important topic of conversation when [PER Erdogan  ] and [ORG POTUS  ] meet in [LOC Washington  ] on December 7. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( SBU ) In marked contrast to [PER Erdogan  ] , President [PER Gul November  ] 2 said [LOC Turkey  ] is against nuclear weapons in its region and the world , " especially in neighboring countries . 
" In remarks to reporters while enroute to [LOC Slovakia  ] , [PER Gul  ] reaffirmed [LOC Turkey  ] 's preference for diplomatic means ( as opposed to the use of military force ) to compel [LOC Tehran  ] 's adherence to its international obligations , but insisted that [LOC Iran  ] " ...must be transparent and open to [ORG IAEA  ] inspection in order to overcome suspicions . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Erdogan  ] 's recent comments on [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program amount to a defense of [LOC Tehran  ] 's defiance of the international community 's will . 
His desire for a " good " [LOC Washington  ] visit is the goad we will continue use to try to turn him back towards the international community consensus on [LOC Iran  ] . 
We will also emphasize to [PER Erdogan  ] 's senior bureuacrats and , when the opportunity arises , to President [PER Gul  ] their interest in reining in [PER Erdogan  ] on [LOC Iran  ] .
