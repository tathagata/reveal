SUMMARY: Per reftel request , we interviewed [MISC Spanish  ] officials regarding marine security programs . 
No single [ORG GOS  ] agency is responsible for marine security . 
Each regional port authority is responsible to assure that ports in its jurisdiction comply with [LOC International Ship  ] and [ORG Port Facilities Code  ] ( [ORG ISPS  ] ) protocol . 
Ports of State ( or Puertos de Estado ) , loosely affiliated with the [ORG Ministry of Public Works  ] , has been helping ready applicable ports for [ORG ISPS  ] compliance , although it is not directly responsible for any port security issues . 
Contacts from the Ports of State informed us that they were confident preparations for the 1 July deadline would be met , and that they believe the state of port security in [LOC Spain  ] is generally higher than in most [MISC European  ] ports due to [LOC Spain  ] , s experience with homegrown terrorist groups . 
[LOC Spain  ] , s [ORG Merchant Marine  ] is responsible for [ORG ISPS  ] and Safety of Life at [LOC Sea  ] ( SOLAS ) regulations for applicable ships . 
Additionally , the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOS  ] are collaborating on several security initiatives . 
The [ORG Department of Energy  ] 's ( [ORG DOE  ] ) [ORG Megaports Initiative  ] continues to progress , with a [ORG DOE  ] team arriving for a familiarization tour of the Port of [LOC Algeciras  ] in late July . 
The [ORG Container Security Initiative  ] will begin implementation in late July as well when a USG-owned scanner will be lent to the [ORG GOS  ] for use in [LOC Algeciras  ] . 
END SUMMARY . 
[LOC SPAIN  ] , S [ORG ISPS PLANS:  ] PORT FACILITIES <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
The ports of [LOC Spain  ] are implementing a series of port security measures to comply with the [ORG ISPS  ] . 
According to [PER Pedro Roman  ] , Safety and [ORG Security Department Manager of Infrastructures  ] and [ORG Port Services Directorate  ] , the [ORG ISPS  ] code only applies to 50 port facilities in [LOC Spain  ] , known as [ORG Ports of General Interest  ] ( or Puertos de [ORG Interes General  ] ) . 
They are designated as such because of their international importance or volume of traffic . 
[ORG Ports of General Interest  ] are overseen by the [ORG Ports of State of Spain  ] through 27 regional port authorities . 
According to [PER Roman  ] , only those [ORG Ports of General Interest  ] that receive ships carrying loads greater than 500 gross tons and/or receive any international passengers must comply with the [ORG ISPS  ] . 
Each regional port authority ( and not the [ORG Ports of State  ] ) is directly responsible for assuring compliance by all ports within its jurisdiction . 
[PER Roman  ] reiterated that [LOC Spain  ] 's ports do not have a true centralized management structure . 
Because of this fact , there is no fully-coordinated port facilities security plan . 
The individual port authorities will develop their own security plans within the context of the [ORG ISPS  ] code. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
The ports that are not [ORG Ports of General Interest  ] are known as Autonomous [PER Ports  ] ( or Puertos Autonomos ) . 
They answer to the [ORG Ministry of Public Administration  ] . 
Autonomous Ports are generally not involved in international trade , with the exception of specialized businesses such as shipment of salt to [LOC France  ] and [LOC Italy  ] . 
They mostly service local fishing , transportation , or commercial activities . 
Per [PER Roman  ] , these ports are not required to comply with [ORG ISPS  ] , and are not being briefed on its requirements. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
In an attempt to guide [ORG ISPS  ] compliance efforts , [ORG Ports of State  ] has outlined the following steps necessary for compliance to [ORG ISPS  ] requirements for each Port of General Interest: -- [ORG Designate  ] a port security officer , who must pass a course on port installation security given by [ORG Ports of State  ] , -- Create a port facilities security plan . 
The regional port authority that has jurisdiction over a specific port is responsible for reviewing and approving its port facilities security plan , and -- [ORG Ports of State  ] will evaluate each port , using a computerized port security program that is currently under development . 
This computer program is based on [ORG US Coast Guard  ] port security methodologies and relevant regulations . 
Eventually , a classified port security computer network , based on this evaluation program , will link all ISPS-compliant [MISC Spanish  ] ports. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
Contacts from [ORG Ports of State  ] were confident that applicable ports would be ready to begin compliance procedures for the 1 July deadline . 
Mr. [PER Roman  ] views this deadline , however , as the date by which all of the ports would start their preparations for [ORG ISPS  ] compliance and not necessarily be fully compliant with [ORG ISPS  ] protocol . 
According to the President of the [ORG Ports of State  ] [PER Mariano Navas  ] , preparations for [ORG ISPS  ] compliance have been easier for [MISC Spanish  ] ports than other [MISC European  ] ports , because of their already heightened awareness of terrorist issues . 
Nationalist terrorism has been a threat in [LOC Spain  ] since the 1970 's , from [MISC Basque  ] separatist terror organizations . 
Due to this ongoing threat , the [MISC Spanish  ] have protected their ports more than other [MISC European  ] countries , said [PER Navas  ] . 
Nevertheless , [MISC Spanish  ] ports still lack the equipment and training to combat nuclear threats or track the shipment of illegally transported nuclear materials . 
[LOC SPAIN  ] , S [ORG ISPS PLANS: VESSELS  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
[LOC Spain  ] , s [ORG Merchant Marine  ] is responsible for the security of ships at sea and notification of cargo and personnel . 
As with the [ORG Ports of State  ] , the [ORG Merchant Marine  ] is nominally connected to the [ORG Ministry of Public Works  ] . 
Per [PER Roman  ] , the [ORG Merchant Marine  ] will adapt its systems to comply with chapters 5 and 11 of [ORG ISPS  ] requirements on the automatic identification system for ships . 
The [ORG Merchant Marine  ] will use these guidelines to check cargo and passengers , first by use of a physical logbook , then by a computer system to be installed at a later date . 
[ORG MEGAPORTS INITIATIVE  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
The implementation of the [ORG Department of Energy  ] 's ( [ORG DOE  ] ) [ORG Megaports Initiative  ] should increase [LOC Spain  ] 's ability to protect against illegal shipment of nuclear or radioactive material usable for terrorism by way of commercial traffic . 
We are expecting a team from the [ORG DOE  ] to arrive in mid-July for a familiarization tour of the Port of [LOC Algeciras  ] , where the [ORG DOE  ] is planning to install [ORG Megaports  ] equipment and train personnel . 
The [ORG Megaports Initiative Memorandum of Agreement  ] should be signed in late July , with a detailed technical inspection and planning visit to [LOC Algeciras  ] in late September or early October . 
[ORG CONTAINER SECURITY INITIATIVE  ] ( [LOC CSI  ] ) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
Progress was made in early July when the [ORG GOS  ] agreed to accept the loan of a particular scanner for activation of the [LOC CSI  ] program in [LOC Algeciras  ] . 
Various [ORG Department of Homeland Security  ] personnel are expected to arrive in [LOC Spain  ] in late July to participate in [LOC CSI  ] , s [LOC Algeciras  ] implementation . 
Progress has been extremely slow , however , on the [ORG GOS  ] tender for purchase of a scanner for [LOC CSI  ] . 
[ORG Ports of State  ] President [PER Navas  ] ( who only recently has taken office ) , said that his organization is still determining the best specifications for [MISC Spanish  ] ports. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
COMMENT: [PER Roman  ] , the Safety and [ORG Security Manager of the Ports of Spain  ] admitted to being almost exhausted from the effort that he has undertaken in moving [LOC Spain  ] , s [ORG Ports of General Interest  ] toward compliance with [ORG ISPS  ] . 
His description of processes , and his clear delineation of his responsibilities from those of other port authorities , made it seem that he was looking forward to the completion of his part of the [ORG ISPS  ] implementation program . 
Additionally , President [PER Navas  ] seemed interested in resolving the problems surrounding procurement of scanners and training . 
We hope to see movement on the tender by early autumn .
