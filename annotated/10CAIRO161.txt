KEY POINTS -- ( U ) On February 2 , the [ORG Press Syndicate  ] issued a warning to [ORG National Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG NDP  ] ) member [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] for violating its ban on contact with [MISC Israelis  ] by meeting September 14 with the [MISC Israeli  ] Ambassador in her office at the [MISC GOE-funded Al-Ahram Center.  ] -- ( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us this warning was the lightest reprimand could have received , as the syndicate could have terminated membership , thereby threatening XXX employment at the [MISC Al-Ahram Center.  ] -- ( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us she blames the [ORG GOE  ] for orchestrating a flurry of critical press articles in the weeks following the meeting and the syndicate 's disciplinary hearings she was summoned to attend. -- ( C ) Civil society contacts were surprised at [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's meeting with the [MISC Israeli  ] Ambassador . 
One human rights activist told us that while he sometimes meets with [MISC Israeli  ] [ORG NGOs  ] outside [LOC Egypt  ] , meetings in [LOC Egypt  ] would be " impossible . 
" <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC Comment: Almost  ] all of [MISC Egyptian  ] civil society maintains a negative attitude toward [LOC Israel  ] , consistent with the public 's anger at the [MISC Israeli  ] occupation and military actions against [MISC Palestinians  ] , and would rule out any contact with the [MISC Israeli  ] Government . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's engagement with the [MISC Israeli  ] Government is exceptional in this context , and the [ORG GOE  ] is loath for any civil society activist -- particularly a member of the [ORG NDP  ] -- to challenge the status quo . 
End comment. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] - member of the influential [ORG NDP  ] policies committee and editor of the [ORG GOE-funded Al-Ahram Center  ] 's journal " Democracy " - told us the [ORG Press Syndicate  ] issued [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] an oral warning February 2 not to meet again with any [MISC Israeli  ] , following her September 14 meeting with [MISC Israeli  ] Ambassador [PER Shalom Cohen  ] . 
( Note: Ambassador [PER Cohen  ] departed [LOC Cairo  ] in late January . 
End note . 
) XXXXXXXXXXXXXsaid the syndicate also cautioned that she would face unspecified " consequences " if she meets again with [MISC Israelis  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] speculated that the syndicate gave her a light reprimand because the [ORG GOE  ] did not want to face the political fallout and publicity she believes would have followed a more stringent decision . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] disputed the February 2 claim of a [ORG Press Syndicate  ] disciplinary committee member on satellite television that a warning " sufficed " because [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] expressed regret over the meeting . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said she did not apologize to the syndicate , and maintains her " conviction " that it is her " right " to meet with the [MISC Israeli  ] ambassador or any other [MISC Israeli  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX will not meet with [MISC Israelis  ] again in [ORG Al-Ahram Center  ] office. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] met with the [MISC Israeli  ] Ambassador September 14 in [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] office at the center to discuss an international conference on the peace process . 
Following the meeting , there was a series of critical press articles for about three weeks , and on October 10 the [ORG Press Syndicate  ] began investigative hearings on disciplining [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] for violating its 1983 ban on contact with [MISC Israelis  ] . 
[PER Mustafa  ] told us the [ORG Press Syndicate  ] 's 1983 ban is often breached , as journalists from pro-government " [ORG Al-Ahram  ] " newspaper have interviewed several [MISC Israeli  ] leaders since 1983 without consequences . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] blamed the [ORG GOE  ] for orchestrating a press campaign against [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , and for directing the [ORG Press Syndicate  ] to begin hearings . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] did not expect political fallout from [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] meeting , and that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had frequently hosted [MISC Israeli  ] officials in her office , but never the ambassador. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that following XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX attendance at an August reception at the [MISC Israeli  ] Ambassador 's residence ( we noticed was the only [MISC Egyptian  ] guest there ) , a senior [ORG NDP  ] official " close to President [PER Mubarak  ] " called to ask about [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] presence . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , who often courts public attention , said that once the controversy began , she wanted to " open up " the subject of contact with [MISC Israelis  ] , and therefore appeared on numerous talk shows to defend her right to meet with [MISC Israeli  ] officials. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) NGO contacts expressed surprise at [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's decision to meet the [MISC Israeli  ] Ambassador at the [ORG Al-Ahram Center  ] . 
Director [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that while he meets [MISC Israeli  ] [ORG NGOs  ] , such as [ORG B'tselem  ] , outside of [LOC Egypt  ] at [ORG UN  ] or international conference venues , he believes the [ORG GOE  ] would not welcome him meeting [MISC Israeli  ] [ORG NGOs  ] in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
He judged that the [ORG GOE  ] would not accept him meeting with the [MISC Israeli  ] Government . 
A [ORG Cairo University  ] professor who met with [MISC Israeli  ] academics following the 1979 Camp [PER David Accords  ] until [LOC Israel  ] 's 1982 [LOC Lebanon  ] invasion told us he follows the decision made by [MISC Egyptian  ] universities to refuse meetings with [MISC Israeli  ] academics until there is a [MISC Palestinian  ] state . 
" How can we meet with them while they are killing [MISC Palestinians  ] ? 
" he asked. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Also on February 2 , the press syndicate suspended [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] for three months for violating the syndicate ban on contact with [MISC Israelis  ] . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said on satellite television February 2 that he had always received approval from the magazine 's chief editor before visiting [LOC Israel  ] . 
According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told her privately he had always coordinated his visits with " [MISC Egyptian  ] security . 
" [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] speculated the syndicate took more substantive action against the lower-profile [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to balance its favorable treatment of her .
