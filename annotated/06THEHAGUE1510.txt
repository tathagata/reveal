Police-to- police cooperation has continued to improve . 
End Summary . 
Recent Counter-Narcotics Developments ------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to an unpublished report by the [ORG Dutch National Crime Squad  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] police seized 1.85 million ecstasy ( [ORG MDMA  ] ) tablets and 220 kilograms of [ORG MDMA  ] powder in the [LOC Netherlands  ] in 2005 , a major decrease from the 5.6 million tablets and 303 kilograms of powder seized in 2004 . 
[MISC Dutch  ] police estimate that 1 kilogram of powder can be used to produce 10,000 [ORG MDMA  ] tablets. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Tom Driessen  ] , head of the [ORG National Crime Squad  ] told [ORG ONDCP  ] Director [PER John Walters  ] during Walters' April visit to The [ORG Hague  ] that the establishment of the [ORG National Crime Squad  ] , which is responsible for the investigation of organized crime , in early 2004 had significantly improved the effectiveness of the [MISC Dutch  ] police against international criminal groups involved in narcotics production and trafficking . 
He said this was due in large part to the enhanced ability of the police to cooperate with the [LOC U.S.  ] and other international partners ; effective cooperation had been more difficult previously , when investigation of serious crime was decentralized among 25 police regions . 
[PER Driessen  ] credited improved intelligence and investigations of money and trade flows for the [MISC Dutch  ] ability to better combat ecstasy production and trade . 
He acknowledged that resource limitations continued to hamper their efforts to track and interdict illicit money flows . 
[PER Walters  ] commended the [MISC Dutch  ] for their successful efforts to curb the ecstasy trade. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Encouraged by the success of the initial [MISC GONL  ] five- year plan ( 2002-2006 ) to combat ecstasy production and distribution , the [ORG Justice Ministry  ] is currently developing a follow-on five-year ecstasy plan . 
The interagency plan will also involve the Interior , Finance , [ORG Defense and Health ministries  ] . 
A June 6 [ORG EUROPOL Organized Crime Threat Analysis  ] identified the production and distribution of synthetic drugs by organized crime groups based in [LOC Belgium  ] and the [LOC Netherlands  ] as the top law enforcement priority for the [MISC Dutch  ] . 
[ORG Justice Ministry  ] officials welcomed the [ORG EUROPOL  ] appraisal as helpful to their efforts to ensure that combating the ecstasy trade will remain a top law enforcement priority . 
[ORG Police-to-Police Cooperation  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) While [MISC Dutch  ] judicial system and privacy restrictions continue to hamper direct police-to-police intelligence sharing in the absence of a formal [ORG Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty  ] ( [ORG MLAT  ] ) request , progress is being made on effective operational cooperation . 
As a result of the April 2005 Next Steps bilateral law enforcement discussions , since October 2005 two [ORG DEA  ] agents have been co-located with the [ORG National Crime Squad  ] cocaine unit in The [ORG Hague  ] , which specializes in [MISC South American  ] and [LOC Caribbean  ] narcotics investigation . 
Under the co-location arrangement , [ORG DEA  ] agents have access to the unit 's intelligence and tactical officers , and are able to pass and receive police-to-police information in an expeditious manner . 
Since the co-location began , joint investigations have led to the seizure of roughly 6,200 kilograms of cocaine and the arrest of 32 defendants . 
[ORG DEA  ] reached agreement in June 2006 to co-locate a third agent with the [ORG National Crime Squad  ] 's [ORG Helmond  ] unit in the southern [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
Co-location with the [ORG Helmond  ] THE [ORG HAGUE  ] 00001510 002.2 OF 003 unit , which is expected to begin this summer , was a top objective of [ORG DEA  ] because the [ORG Helmond  ] unit specializes in ecstasy and precursor chemical investigations. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Since late 2005 , [MISC Dutch  ] police have also responded positively to [ORG DEA  ] requests to conduct controlled deliveries without an [ORG MLAT  ] request ; previously , they had turned down all such informal requests . 
In the first six months of 2006 , the [MISC Dutch  ] have conducted six controlled deliveries of cocaine at the request of [ORG DEA  ] on a police-to-police basis . 
[LOC U.S.  ] police conducted one controlled delivery of 3,700 ecstasy tablets at the request of the [MISC Dutch  ] . 
This was the only request presented by the [MISC Dutch  ] in the past seven months , but illustrates their interest in expanding law enforcement cooperation. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG DEA  ] credits the ongoing successful information sharing between [MISC Dutch  ] police and the [ORG El Paso Intelligence Center  ] ( [ORG EPIC  ] ) for improving police-to-police cooperation in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
Over 6,000 names have been shared in the [LOC Schiphol  ] Blacklist program in which [ORG EPIC  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] police share names of known or suspected drug traffickers for entry in the other 's database . 
During a June 29 meeting to review the Blacklist program , [ORG DEA  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] police and [ORG Justice Ministry  ] officials all agreed that drug trafficker data is flowing smoothly and that the program is working well. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Improved coordination between [ORG DEA  ] The [ORG Hague  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] police has led to several recent major busts , including the seizure of 46 kilograms of cocaine at [LOC Schiphol  ] airport on June 19 , 2006 . 
In the [LOC Schiphol  ] case , the [ORG Dutch Royal Military Police  ] ( [ORG KMAR  ] ) , which is responsible for border control , acted on a [ORG DEA  ] tip to intercept two arriving couriers , who will be prosecuted in the [LOC Netherlands  ] on charges of importation of a controlled substance. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On May 31 and June 1 , 2006 , the [ORG DEA  ] office in The [ORG Hague  ] , in conjunction with other [ORG DEA  ] offices and the [ORG Royal Dutch National Police  ] ( [ORG KLPD  ] ) executed international arrest and search warrants against an international ecstasy trade and money laundering ring . 
Of the ten suspects arrested , eight will be prosecuted in the [LOC United States  ] and two will be prosecuted in the [LOC Netherlands  ] . 
The [ORG KLPD National Crime Squad  ] unit in [ORG Helmond  ] provided [ORG DEA  ] with outstanding support throughout the two year investigation. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [MISC Dutch  ] authorities attended a [MISC DEA-sponsored  ] precursor chemical strategy conference in [LOC Hong Kong  ] in February 2006 and took part in [ORG DEA  ] 's [ORG International Drug Enforcement Conference  ] ( [ORG IDEC  ] ) in [LOC Montreal  ] in May 2006 . 
[ORG International Cooperation  ] ------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Bilateral cooperation on demand reduction research has continued in the past year , with scientific exchanges between the [LOC Netherlands  ] Organization for [ORG Health Research and Development  ] ( [ORG ZonMW  ] ) and the [ORG Trimbos Institute  ] and [ORG U.S. National Institute  ] on [ORG Drug Abuse  ] ( [ORG NIDA  ] ) . 
[ORG ONDCP  ] Director [PER Walters  ] and Health Minister [PER Hoogervorst  ] agreed to consider expanding joint research to include studies on long-term drug consumption during [PER Walters  ] 's April 2006 visit. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Dutch Justice Ministry  ] signed a [ORG MOU  ] with the [MISC Chinese  ] government to expedite the sharing of customs information and better track shipments of precursor chemicals in 2004 . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] continue to negotiate a [ORG MOU  ] with the [MISC Chinese  ] that would cover direct police-to-police operational cooperation in tracking precursor chemicals . 
[ORG Justice Ministry  ] officials acknowledge that the negotiations are proceeding very slowly . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are also debating internally how extensive the [ORG MOU  ] should be , due to concerns about entering into a broad cooperative police agreement with a country that has a poor human rights record. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [MISC Dutch  ] government hosted a conference on enhancing [ORG EU  ] anti-drug cooperation in the [LOC Caribbean  ] in February 2006 . 
The [MISC GONL  ] is pressing the [ORG European Commission  ] THE [ORG HAGUE  ] 00001510 003.2 OF 003 and member states to increase their financial commitments to counter-narcotics efforts in the [LOC Caribbean  ] region . 
Comment ------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [MISC Dutch  ] government has continued to make substantial progress in the last year against ecstasy production and trafficking . 
In particular , they are more effectively targeting international criminal organizations involved in the trade . 
Police-to-police cooperation and information sharing has also improved significantly ; the recent agreement on the co-location of [ORG DEA  ] agents in a second key [ORG National Crime Squad  ] drug unit is expected to result in additional successful joint investigations .
