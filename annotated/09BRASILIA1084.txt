Reasons: 1.4 ( B ) & ( D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Charge delivered reftel letter on the [ORG U.S.- Colombia Defense Cooperation Agreement  ] ( [ORG DCA  ] ) to [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Ministry of External Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) Head of the [ORG United States/Canada/Inter-American Affairs Department  ] [PER Carlos Abreu  ] on August 27 . 
Later that day , [PER Abreu  ] confirmed that FM [PER Celso Amorim  ] had read the letter before he departed for [LOC Bariloche  ] , [LOC Argentina  ] to attend the August 28 [ORG UNASUL  ] summit. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a meeting that afternoon with [MISC PolCouns  ] and [ORG MLO  ] Chief , [PER Abreu  ] , [ORG Pol/Mil Advisor  ] to the Deputy Foreign Minister [ORG Amb  ] . 
[MISC Marcos Pinta Gama  ] , and [ORG Policy Planning Director  ] [PER Amb  ] . 
[PER Hermano Telles Ribeiro  ] said that the Secretary 's letter was helpful as a " political document . 
" However , it had not answered all of the questions they still had about the [ORG DCA  ] . 
They raised several follow on questions and concerns regarding the types of missions that will be flown from the bases negotiated in the [ORG DCA  ] . 
[MISC PolCouns  ] and [ORG MLO  ] Colonel explained the agreement and its basic intent , the provisions for respecting sovereignty , and the requirements of [MISC Colombian  ] permission for [LOC U.S.  ] operations . 
In addition , [ORG MLO  ] Chief explained the nature of a [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Air Force TransCom  ] white paper , clarifying that it was not a policy document . 
Both said they were grateful for the information the [LOC United States  ] and [LOC Colombia  ] had shared on the [ORG DCA  ] , but said they were still unclear on the " full scope " of operations that would be conducted under the [ORG DCA  ] and what types of planes would be used . 
They encouraged us to provide in writing any additional information we could regarding the operations that would be conducted . 
[MISC Pinta Gama  ] stressed the sensitivity of this [LOC U.S.  ] presence in [LOC South America  ] , especially in light of how the news had come to the region 's attention . 
[PER Telles Ribeiro  ] said that [LOC Brazil  ] has a mediating role to play in the region and was trying to prevent the worst of the rhetoric at the [ORG UNASUL  ] meeting. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [MISC COMMENT:  ] Although [MISC Brazilian  ] suspicions about [LOC U.S.  ] intentions toward the region , the [LOC Amazon  ] , and their recently discovered sub-salt oil reserves have been heightened by the [LOC Colombia  ] bases issue , [LOC Brazil  ] 's immediate goal in seeking detailed information on the [ORG DCA  ] and our planned operations in [LOC Colombia  ] is to countering [MISC Venezuelan  ] assertions regarding the intent of the [ORG DCA  ] in order to preserve peace among its neighbors and ensure that [ORG UNASUL  ] does not collapse . 
The [ORG GOB  ] wants to be assured that the [LOC United States  ] does not intend to run operations outside of [LOC Colombia--in  ] particular in Venezuela--and the rather vague provisions of the [ORG DCA  ] leaves them uneasy . 
Two [ORG GOB  ] officials have separately referred to [LOC Brazil  ] , s " mediating role " in the region , leading us to believe that [LOC Brazil  ] is actively trying to lower the temperature at the [ORG UNASUL  ] meeting .
