( C ) Summary and comment: On December 23 , April 6 activist [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] expressed satisfaction with his participation in the December 3-5 " Alliance of [ORG Youth Movements Summit  ] , " and with his subsequent meetings with [ORG USG  ] officials , on [LOC Capitol Hill  ] , and with think tanks . 
He described how [ORG State Security  ] ( [ORG SSIS  ] ) detained him at the [LOC Cairo  ] airport upon his return and confiscated his notes for his summit presentation calling for democratic change in [LOC Egypt  ] , and his schedule for his [ORG Congressional  ] meetings . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] contended that the [ORG GOE  ] will never undertake significant reform , and therefore , [MISC Egyptians  ] need to replace the current regime with a parliamentary democracy . 
He alleged that several opposition parties and movements have accepted an unwritten plan for democratic transition by 2011 ; we are doubtful of this claim . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that although [ORG SSIS  ] recently released two April 6 activists , it also arrested three additional group members . 
We have pressed the [ORG MFA  ] for the release of these April 6 activists . 
April 6 's stated goal of replacing the current regime with a parliamentary democracy prior to the 2011 presidential elections is highly unrealistic , and is not supported by the mainstream opposition . 
End summary and comment. ---------------------------- Satisfaction with the [ORG Summit  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] expressed satisfaction with the December 3-5 " Alliance of [ORG Youth Movements Summit  ] " in [LOC New York  ] , noting that he was able to meet activists from other countries and outline his movement 's goals for democratic change in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
He told us that the other activists at the summit were very supportive , and that some even offered to hold public demonstrations in support of [MISC Egyptian  ] democracy in their countries , with [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] as an invited guest . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he discussed with the other activists how April 6 members could more effectively evade harassment and surveillance from [ORG SSIS  ] with technical upgrades , such as consistently alternating computer " simcards . 
" However , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] lamented to us that because most April 6 members do not own computers , this tactic would be impossible to implement . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] was appreciative of the successful efforts by the [ORG Department and the  ] summit organizers to protect his identity at the summit , and told us that his name was never mentioned publicly. ------------------- A Cold Welcome Home ------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us that [ORG SSIS  ] detained and searched him at the [LOC Cairo Airport  ] on December 18 upon his return from the [LOC U.S.  ] According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [ORG SSIS  ] found and confiscated two documents in his luggage: notes for his presentation at the summit that described April 6 's demands for democratic transition in [LOC Egypt  ] , and a schedule of his [LOC Capitol Hill  ] meetings . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] described how the [ORG SSIS  ] officer told him that [ORG State Security  ] is compiling a file on him , and that the officer 's superiors instructed him to file a report on [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's most recent activities. --------------------------------------------- ---------- [ORG Washington Meetings  ] and April 6 Ideas for Regime Change --------------------------------------------- ---------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] described his [LOC Washington  ] appointments as positive , saying that on the Hill he met with [ORG Rep. Edward Royce  ] , a variety of [ORG House  ] staff members , including from the offices of [ORG Rep. Ros-Lehtinen  ] ( [ORG R-FL  ] ) and [ORG Rep.  ] [PER Wolf  ] ( [ORG R-VA  ] ) , and with two [ORG Senate  ] staffers . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] also noted that he met with several think tank members . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that [ORG Rep.  ] [PER Wolf  ] 's office invited him to speak at a late January [ORG Congressional  ] hearing on [ORG House Resolution  ] 1303 regarding religious and political freedom in [LOC Egypt  ] . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us he is interested in attending , but conceded he is unsure whether he will have the funds to make the trip . 
He indicated to us that he has not been focusing on his work as a " fixer " for journalists , due to his preoccupation with his [LOC U.S.  ] trip. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] described how he tried to convince his [LOC Washington  ] interlocutors that the [ORG USG  ] should pressure the [ORG GOE  ] to implement significant reforms by threatening to reveal [LOC CAIRO  ] 00002572 002 OF 002 information about [ORG GOE  ] officials' alleged " illegal " off-shore bank accounts . 
He hoped that the [LOC U.S.  ] and the international community would freeze these bank accounts , like the accounts of [MISC Zimbabwean  ] President [PER Mugabe  ] 's confidantes . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said he wants to convince the [ORG USG  ] that [PER Mubarak  ] is worse than [PER Mugabe  ] and that the [ORG GOE  ] will never accept democratic reform . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] asserted that [PER Mubarak  ] derives his legitimacy from [LOC U.S.  ] support , and therefore charged the [LOC U.S.  ] with " being responsible " for [PER Mubarak  ] 's " crimes . 
" He accused [ORG NGOs  ] working on political and economic reform of living in a " fantasy world , " and not recognizing that [PER Mubarak  ] -- " the head of the snake " -- must step aside to enable democracy to take root. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] claimed that several opposition forces -- including the [MISC Wafd  ] , [PER Nasserite  ] , [PER Karama  ] and [MISC Tagammu  ] parties , and the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] , [PER Kifaya  ] , and [ORG Revolutionary Socialist  ] movements -- have agreed to support an unwritten plan for a transition to a parliamentary democracy , involving a weakened presidency and an empowered prime minister and parliament , before the scheduled 2011 presidential elections ( ref C ) . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , the opposition is interested in receiving support from the army and the police for a transitional government prior to the 2011 elections . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] asserted that this plan is so sensitive it cannot be written down . 
( Comment: We have no information to corroborate that these parties and movements have agreed to the unrealistic plan [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] has outlined . 
Per ref C , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] previously told us that this plan was publicly available on the internet . 
End comment . 
) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the [ORG GOE  ] has recently been cracking down on the April 6 movement by arresting its members . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] noted that although [ORG SSIS  ] had released [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] " in the past few days , " it had arrested three other members . 
( Note: On December 14 , we pressed the [ORG MFA  ] for the release of [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , and on December 28 we asked the [ORG MFA  ] for the [ORG GOE  ] to release the additional three activists . 
End note . 
) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] conceded that April 6 has no feasible plans for future activities . 
The group would like to call for another strike on April 6 , 2009 , but realizes this would be " impossible " due to [ORG SSIS  ] interference , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said . 
He lamented that the [ORG GOE  ] has driven the group 's leadership underground , and that one of its leaders , [PER Ahmed Maher  ] , has been in hiding for the past week. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] offered no roadmap of concrete steps toward April 6 's highly unrealistic goal of replacing the current regime with a parliamentary democracy prior to the 2011 presidential elections . 
Most opposition parties and independent [ORG NGOs  ] work toward achieving tangible , incremental reform within the current political context , even if they may be pessimistic about their chances of success . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] 's wholesale rejection of such an approach places him outside this mainstream of opposition politicians and activists .
