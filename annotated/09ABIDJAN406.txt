Nesbitt  ] for Reasons 1.4 ( b/d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
C ) [MISC Summary: Although  ] key figures in the [MISC Ivorian  ] government and opposition continue to insist publicly that elections must be held as scheduled on November 29 , resident diplomats are highly skeptical , as are most politically-savvy [MISC Ivorians  ] . 
The gap between public pronouncements and the behind-the-scenes reality has become so clear , in fact , that [ORG UN  ] SRSG [PER Choi  ] has started referring in private conversations to the " myth and reality " of elections in [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] . 
This message describes the key myths and realities as we see them . 
End Summary MYTH #1: [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] Will Hold Elections in November 2009 --------------------------------------------- --------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [MISC Ivorian  ] government , [ORG Independent Electoral Commission  ] ( [ORG CEI  ] ) , and opposition candidates have not deviated in public from the commitment to hold elections this year . 
But the date was set in response to international pressure ( predominantly from the [MISC French  ] and the [ORG UN  ] ) and a key motivation of each of the central actors is to avoid being fingered as being responsible for the delay . 
Continuing to pay tribute to the 'm yth' that elections will take place as scheduled is viewed as necessary to demonstrate a commitment to the process . 
The truth , however , is that electoral preparations are already lagging behind schedule and deep doubts persist about the willingness of those currently in power to risk losing office. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [ORG Reality: There  ] will not be an election unless President [PER Gbagbo  ] is confident that he will win it -- and he is not yet confident of the outcome . 
This has been the assessment of some analysts since 2005 and the political landscape in [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] helps to explain why . 
[PER Gbagbo  ] 's political party , the [ORG FPI  ] ( [ORG Front Populaire Ivoirien  ] ) , consistently comes in at third place is still associated with a minority ethnic group ( the [MISC Bete  ] ) . 
To win a presidential election , the [ORG FPI  ] needs an alliance with one of the larger parties - either the [ORG PDCI  ] ( [LOC Parti Democratique de  ] [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] ) or the [ORG RDR  ] ( Rassemblement des [MISC Republicains  ] ) , but the latter have remained remarkably united in an alliance against the [ORG FPI  ] , known as the [ORG RHDP  ] ( Rassemblement des Houphouetistes ) . 
Reliable sources indicate that [PER Gbagbo  ] has tried since at least 2007 to cut a deal with [PER Alassane Ouattara  ] , president of the [ORG RDR  ] , but has not succeeded . 
Ambassador was told just last week that having failed yet again to co-opt [PER Ouattara  ] , [PER Gbagbo  ] is now focused on promoting a rift within the [ORG PDCI  ] by helping to finance and support former-Prime Minister [PER Charles Banny  ] 's efforts to replace aging former-President [PER Henri Konan Bedie  ] as the [ORG PDCI  ] 's candidate for president . 
Whether or not [PER Banny  ] succeeds is irrelevant from the [ORG FPI  ] 's perspective , as long as the internal struggle induces a certain percentage of [ORG PDCI  ] voters to go elsewhere . 
[PER Gbagbo  ] recently told a well-placed source that he wants to face [PER Alassane Ouattara  ] in the second round ( no one expects a winner to emerge from the first round ) because he ( [PER Gbagbo  ] ) believes that the ethnic groups who traditionally support the [ORG PDCI  ] will vote [ORG FPI  ] , rather that support an [ORG RDR  ] leader who has links to the rebellion. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) In addition to these calculations , there are other reasons for the governing coalition to want to hang on for as long as they can . 
[LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] will celebrate the 50th anniversary of its independence in August 2010 . 
Savvy observers do not believe that President [PER Gbagbo  ] ( who savors the role of [LOC Le Grand Chef  ] ) will risk losing the prestige and celebrity that goes with hosting such an historic event . 
Also , the [ORG GOCI  ] lobbied successfully to host the spring 2010 meeting of the [ORG African Development Bank  ] 's general assembly , an event that we believe [PER Gbagbo  ] will use to declare that [PER Cote  ] d'Ivoire 's crisis has been resolved and the country has returned to normal , even if elections have not been held . 
Thus the fall of 2010 currently appears to be the most realistic potential timeframe for elections . 
President [PER Gbagbo  ] will been in office for ten years ( the equivalent of two terms ) and although he has stated publicly that he considers himself to be in an extended first mandate , remaining in office without a new mandate will become harder to justify after 2010 . 
The financial benefits of the status quo are , of course , a prime consideration and not just for the [ORG FPI  ] but for individuals such as the PM [PER Soro  ] ( Secretary General of the [ORG Forces Nouvelles  ] ) as well. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Embassy will be sending septel a detailed report on the status of the voter registration process and logistical preparations for the elections . 
While progress is being made , the picture is not encouraging in terms of a vote this year . 
For despite months of dedicated work and millions of dollars worth of expenditures , not a single voter registration or national ID card has been produced . 
Data collected partly by hand on over 6 million individuals must be computerized , linked up with fingerprints and vaQed before cards can be produced and distributed . 
The likelihood that this will be accomplished before November is slim , and there is no indication that either the President or the Prime Minister 's office is pushing for rapid action . 
MYTH #2: The [ORG Forces Nouvelles Are Disarming  ] ; [PER Cote  ] d'Ivoire Is Being Reunified --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Cote  ] d'Ivoire has held a number of symbolic ceremonies to mark advances in the sortie de crise ( crisis recovery ) program , such as the [ORG Flame of Peace  ] cermony in 2007 , numerous demobilization ceremonies in 2008 , and most recently on May 26 , a ceremony to launch the handing over of power from rebel zone commanders ( comzones ) to civilian authorities . 
Genuine progress has indeed been made: thousands of young men have abandoned the rebellion and civilian authorities have returned to every major city in the north , if not every district. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [MISC Reality:  ] The progress that has been made is , unfortunately , only superficial , for it now appears that the [ORG Ouaga IV  ] agreement ( the fourth agreement to the [ORG Ouagadougou Political Agreement  ] ) is fundamentally an agreement between [PER Blaise Compaore  ] and [PER Laurent Gbagbo  ] to share control of the north until after the presidential election , despite the fact that the text calls for the [ORG Forces Nouvelles  ] to return control of the north to the government and complete disarmament two months before the election . 
Ambassador [PER Badini  ] ( Facilitator [PER Blaise Compaore  ] 's representative in [LOC Abidjan  ] ) confirmed to Ambassador on June 26 , the power-sharing nature ( but not the details ) of the accord . 
[PER Badini  ] acknowledged that the mixed brigades ( joint FAFN-FDS units ) slated to provide security for the elections are intended in part to give both sides a window onto what is happening in the north , and increase confidence that massive fraud will not take place . 
But the 5,000 [ORG Forces Nouvelles  ] soldiers who are to be " disarmed " and regrouped into barracks in four key cities in the north and west until a new national army is created , represent a serious military capability that the [ORG FAFN  ] intends to keep well-trained and in reserve until after the election . 
The hand-over of administrative power from the [ORG FAFN  ] to civilian government authorities is a pre-requisite for elections but , as travelers to the north ( including Embassy personnel ) confirm: the [ORG FAFN  ] retain de-facto control of the region , especially when it comes to finances . 
Disarmament and reunification are not separate processes . 
They are intertwined . 
As long as the confidence needed to effect disarmament is lacking , reunification will prove elusive . 
Implications ------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) There is a silver lining to this cloud , and it is the fact that [PER Compaore  ] ( perceived as the benefactor of the [ORG FAFN  ] ) and [PER Gbagbo  ] are engaged in a direct dialogue designed to put an end to the conflict that erupted with the failed coup d'etat in 2002 . 
They have taken ownership of the problem and while this has effectively reduced the role the international community can play , their apparent willingness to resolve their differences peacefully has led to distinct improvements . 
Tensions have been reduced as the relationship between the President [PER Gbagbo  ] and PM [PER Soro  ] has improved , and no one expQ a full-scale civil war to resume although there is still a potential for clashes between rival elements . 
Our posture as an interested and active member of the international community has been the most effective stance we have taken and we will continue to play that role unless the situation changes .
