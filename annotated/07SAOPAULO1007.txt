SUMMARY: Assistant Secretary for the [ORG Bureau of Economic , Energy  ] , and [ORG Business Affairs Daniel S. Sullivan  ] held a roundtable on intellectual property rights ( [ORG IPR  ] ) on December 12 at the [LOC U.S.  ] Consulate in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
Representatives from recording , film , publishing , healthcare , and [LOC Sao Paulo  ] state industry all voiced concern about the growing preponderance of intellectual property rights violations in the country . 
The common themes were the adverse affect on [MISC Brazilian  ] culture that pirated goods represent and the apparent lack of interest by the [ORG Government of Brazil  ] in enforcement of existing laws . 
According to several of the interlocutors present , universities and the [ORG Government of Brazil  ] ( [ORG GOB  ] ) itself also distribute pirated goods . 
[PER A/S Sullivan  ] told the group he would convey to the [ORG GOB  ] the group 's message about the damage to a country 's cultural heritage pirated goods represent , and encouraged the participants to do the same . 
END SUMMARY . 
Music and Film -------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
[PER Jorge Wilson Clayton  ] , an attorney for the [ORG Association Against Piracy  ] for the Movie and Music Industry ( [ORG APCM  ] ) noted that the big problem in [LOC Brazil  ] is sales of pirated CDs on the streets . 
He noted more than 200 " burners " in [LOC Brazil  ] where music and movies are illegally copied for sale in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
As a result , many legitimate movie rental chains ( including [ORG Blockbuster  ] which sold its chain of stores in [LOC Brazil  ] to [PER Lojas Americanas  ] ) have closed because they cannot compete with pirated videos sold on the street . 
He noted 59 percent of films sold in [LOC Brazil  ] are pirated , but that the police regard movie piracy with a lower priority despite precincts dedicated to fighting [ORG IPR  ] violations . 
[PER Clayton  ] argued that the lack of prosecution encourages the behavior to continue because no one believes they will be punished for buying or selling pirated goods. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
[PER Clayton  ] highlighted that piracy is not only of [MISC American  ] artists , but of [MISC Brazilian  ] movies and music as well . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] movie [ORG Tropa de Elite  ] ( The [ORG Elite Troup  ] ) released earlier this year is the most pirated film in [LOC Brazil  ] to date . 
[ Note: Millions of [MISC Brazilians  ] watched pirated versions of this [ORG Paramount Studios  ] movie before it came out in theaters , forcing [ORG Paramount  ] to release the movie a month earlier than anticipated . 
End Note . 
] Furthermore , 80 percent of music sold in [LOC Brazil  ] is of [MISC Brazilian  ] bands and artists . 
According to [PER Clayton  ] , [MISC Brazilian  ] record labels are launching fewer bands each year because they are not generating adequate profits due to copyright violations . 
He emphasized that local talent suffers in the long run and that eventually only foreign talent would be present in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Books and [ORG Educational Materials  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
Representatives from the publishing industry complained of a similar disregard for copyright laws for textbooks . 
[PER Dalton Spencer Morato Filho  ] , Legal Director for the [MISC Brazilian  ] Association of [ORG Reproduction Rights  ] ( [ORG ABDR  ] ) told [PER A/S Sullivan  ] that universities and students are the biggest culprits of pirated books and articles , including best sellers and books in foreign languages . 
According to [PER Dalton  ] , [ORG ABDR  ] raids of university copy centers that started in 2004 have reduced the physical copying of books and articles ; however , book piracy has moved to university intranet sites and to the internet . 
[ORG ABDR  ] has been somewhat successful in suspending [MISC Brazilian  ] websites , but many foreign sites also host pirated material , including [LOC U.S.  ] based websites . 
[PER Dalton  ] noted the government and police have not seriously condemned book piracy because of the public perception that students are poor and have the right to free access to educational materials. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
[PER Dalton  ] directed [PER A/S Sullivan  ] to a 2005 policy of the [ORG University of Sao Paulo  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] 's largest and best public institution , that allows books that are not written in [MISC Portuguese  ] and/or not published in [LOC Brazil  ] to be reproduced without penalty . 
[ORG ABDR  ] claims the policy has created a standard for other universities and educational centers to follow . 
Even though this activity is considered illegal according to [PER Dalton  ] , the [ORG GOB  ] has not done anything to stop this activity . 
Healthcare ---------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
[PER Elter Santos  ] , [ORG Coordinator of Operations  ] at the [MISC Brazilian  ] Association of Eyeglasses and Sunglasses ( [ORG ABIOTICA  ] ) , told [PER A/S Sullivan  ] that [LOC Brazil  ] 's informal economy supplies 50 percent of eyeglasses , creating an important health concern . 
In 2006 , there were 1.4 million glasses seized ( both [MISC Brazilian  ] and foreign brands ) and [ORG ABIOTICA  ] estimates the authorities seize only 10 percent of imported knock-offs , he said . 
The verification process is time-consuming and expensive . 
[PER Santos  ] estimated that it costs approximately USD 250 to 300 to test a single pair of glasses for authenticity , and that each pair within a shipment needs to be tested at an importer 's expense . 
As transportation , distribution , and marketing costs increase , legitimate importers are unable to cover the costs of pursuing fraudulent merchandise . 
Furthermore , [PER Santos  ] said the government holds auctions to sell any fraudulent merchandise recovered . 
[LOC Sao Paulo Industry Perspective  ] ------------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
The [ORG Sao Paulo Federation of Industries  ] ( [ORG FIESP  ] ) representative for [ORG IPR  ] issues [PER Ana Paula Villela  ] stated that although [LOC Brazil  ] is a huge consumer of pirated goods , most production occurs outside [LOC Brazil  ] 's borders . 
As a result , [ORG FIESP  ] focuses its efforts on educational seminars and training sessions to familiarize consumers on [ORG IPR  ] issues ( some of which [LOC U.S.  ] Patent and [ORG Trade Office  ] ( [ORG USPTO  ] ) contributes to ) , and about the health and security concerns of pirated products . 
She said that despite their efforts , a recent survey by the [ORG American Chamber of Commerce  ] showed that [MISC Brazilians  ] are aware they are buying pirated products , but value the price advantage of pirated goods over the legal implications of their actions . 
In 2006 , [ORG FIESP  ] visited 12 ports and border regions to train customs agents and federal and local police about pirated goods and provide them the legal framework for [ORG IPR  ] protection . 
For the most part , [ORG FIESP  ] has received positive feedback from training participants . 
Lack of Enforcement ------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
All participants at the [ORG IPR Roundtable  ] complained about the lack of committed [ORG IPR  ] enforcement in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[ORG FIESP  ] noted in particular the need to increase criminal penalties for trademark counterfeiting . 
According to participants , the current criminal penalty for copyright piracy is two to four years , while only one to six months for trademark counterfeiting . 
A bill to increase the counterfeiting penalty has been stuck in [ORG Congress  ] since 1999 . 
While the [ORG Lower House  ] approved the original bill in 2001 and the [ORG Senate  ] revised portions of the bill and approved it in September 2003 , [ORG Congress  ] has not promulgated the bill into law. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
The Manager of [ORG Information Control  ] at the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Telecommunications Company  ] ( [ORG EMBRATEL  ] ) [PER Anderson Luis Cantarine  ] also expressed concerns that the Federal government is devoting fewer resources to enforcement . 
He noted that early internet reports suggest that the Federal government will be reducing transfers to the state governments for security , implying fewer resources available for [MISC IP  ] enforcement. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
[ORG COMMENT:  ] [PER A/S Sullivan  ] mentioned to the [ORG IPR Roundtable  ] that he is beginning to see traction in many countries for stronger [ORG IPR  ] enforcement driven by governments' concerns for their own artists and culture and that [ORG IPR  ] protection is not only an [MISC American  ] issue , but has worldwide implications that many developing countries are now waking up to . 
He noted that he would be seeing [MISC Brazilian  ] officials the next day and would be raising these issues . 
The assembled group agreed that it is also incumbent upon them to take the concerns of [MISC Brazilian  ] industry to the Government of [LOC Brazil  ] to underscore how the lack of enforcement has a negative economic impact on [MISC Brazilian  ] companies . 
[PER A/S Sullivan  ] cited groups of young entrepreneurs and executives such as those gathered as the strongest and most effective force for building better understanding that piracy is a serious crime . 
Focusing this problem as detrimental to [MISC Brazilian  ] workers , companies , artists , and culture will help highlight the issue for the [ORG GOB  ] . 
END COMMENT. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
This cable has been cleared by [PER A/S Sullivan  ] 's delegation .
