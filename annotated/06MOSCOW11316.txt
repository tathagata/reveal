Reasons: 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . ------- Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) The October 7 murder of internationally-known investigative journalist [PER Anna Politkovskaya  ] has sent shock waves through [LOC Moscow  ] . 
A public demonstration has been held , the co-owner of [ORG Novaya Gazeta  ] , the newspaper where [MISC Politkovksaya  ] had worked since 1999 , is offering a 25 million ruble reward for information leading to the arrest of the culprit ( s ) , the [ORG GOR Prosecutor General  ] has taken personal charge of the investigation , and prominent media and political personalities have condemned the murder . 
Motives are plentiful . 
Politkovskaya’s intrepid work in [LOC Chechnya  ] , [LOC Beslan  ] , and elsewhere in the [LOC North Caucasus  ] earned her many enemies , and commentators here have been quick to point the finger at figures ranging from [MISC Chechnya’s  ] Prime Minister [PER Ramzan Kadyrov  ] to those interested in seeing President [PER Putin  ] remain at the helm after 2008 . 
The Ambassador has expressed strong [LOC U.S.  ] concerns about the case to First Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Denisov  ] and [ORG Presidential Human Rights Commissioner Pamfilova  ] and will continue to press the case with the [ORG GOR  ] . 
End summary. , ---------------- OCTOBER 7 MURDER ---------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [LOC Moscow  ] media report that internationally-known investigative journalist [PER Anna Politkovskaya  ] was assassinated late-afternoon October 7 just after entering her apartment building near Belorusskiy train station in [LOC Moscow  ] . 
( [PER Politkovskaya  ] was known for uncompromising work highlighting corruption and human rights violations in the [LOC Chechnya  ] war , the [LOC Beslan  ] siege , and the [LOC Moscow  ] Nord-Ost theater siege . 
) The lone assassin fired four shots , and dropped the pistol before fleeing the scene . 
A security camera reportedly caught the blurry image of a man , his face largely concealed by a baseball cap . 
No one has claimed responsibility . 
Immediately after the killing , the area surrounding the apartment was cordoned off and key items from [MISC Politikovskaya’s  ] apartment were removed for analysis for investigators. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Prosecutor General [PER Yuriy Chayka  ] has announced that he personally will take control of the investigation because of its importance . 
Representatives of the Prosecutor’s office have removed for analysis [MISC Politikovskaya’s  ] computer and other items from her office at [ORG Novaya Gazeta  ] , where she had worked since 1999 . 
Embassy understands that a number of journalists [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] have already been questioned by the PG’s office . 
To date , no statement has been made about the progress of the investigation . 
Some of the news media , as of the morning of October 9 , were reporting that there had been no progress in identifying the Politkovskaya’s assassin . 
Others reported that fingerprints and other evidence had been found. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Politkovskaya’s assassination has prompted an outpouring of grief and rage in [LOC Moscow  ] and elsewhere in [LOC Russia  ] . 
An October 8 demonstration , originally scheduled to protest retributions against [MISC Georgians  ] in the wake of the spy scandal in [LOC Tbilisi  ] became as well a commemoration to [PER Politkovskaya  ] . 
( Demonstrations were held in [LOC St. Petersburg  ] and [LOC Samara  ] , as well . 
) A crowd of about one thousand attended . 
Although there were no speeches , prominent human rights and political figures gave interviews to the international and domestic press . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX. described the assassination , which occurred on President Putin’s 54th birthday , a “direct challenge to the President.” [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] saw the killing as a turning point , in which all must choose sides ; either to cooperate with the “fascists” or fight against “such scum.” There were similarly strong words from [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
Among the signs carried by demonstrators: “Politkovskaya is our [PER Gongadze  ] , ” “The cannibalistic people in power killed [PER Anna  ] , ” “Politkovskaya - a great daughter of [MISC Russia.”  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Other comments: [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00011316 002 OF 003 -- [LOC Moscow  ] Mayor [PER Yuriy Luzhkov  ] released a statement saying he was “deeply outraged and shocked by the fact that an honest journalist , who was also a woman and a mother , had been killed” ; -- XXXXXXXXXXXX: “The death of ( [PER Politikovskaya  ] ) is connected with her work in [LOC Chechnya...”  ] -- [MISC Chechnya’s  ] Prime Minister [PER Ramzan Kadyrov  ] said he was shocked by [MISC Politikovskaya’s  ] death , and rejected the assertion that the murder has [MISC Chechen  ] fingerprints on it . 
-- XXXXXXXXXXXX: “Politikovskaya was number one in political journalism . 
. .the murder of such a person is a very symbolic event for [MISC Russia...”  ] -- XXXXXXXXXXXX: “The fact that ( the murder ) occurred on the birthday of President [PER Putin  ] makes it a complicated political provocation . 
. .It is not clear if it was done by an enemy of [PER Putin  ] , or one of his supporters.” -- [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] in a conversation with Embassy [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] paid tribute to [PER Politkovskaya  ] , “a hero who cannot be replaced.” -- [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] have launched their own investigation of the murder . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] Duma Deputy [PER Aleksandr Lebedev  ] has offered a 25 million ruble award for information leading to the rest of the killer ; -- XXXXXXXXXXXX: “conversations about freedom of speech are still just conversations . 
. .This cynical crime is an echo of the turbulent 90s” ; -- XXXXXXXXXXXX: “The ( murder ) is a political provocation , which may be followed by the murders of other well-known people . 
. .” ; -- XXXXXXXXXXXX: “Politkovskaya was an icon who , we believed , had reached the point where she had transcended danger . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] guessed that reporters working on [LOC Chechnya  ] will be even less likely to report frankly than they have in the past ; -- [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] reported that [MISC Moscow-based  ] human rights organizations would be convening soon for a strategy session in the wake of Politkovskaya’s murder. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The mailbox in front of Politkovskaya’s apartment on a busy street has been turned into an informal shrine , with flowers and a picture of the journalist . 
A basket of flowers hangs on the railing in the lobby where [PER Politikovskaya  ] was killed. ------------------ WHY [PER POLITKOVSKAYA  ] ? ------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The assassination of one of [MISC Russia’s  ] most outspoken journalists and the absence to date of any leads has generated much speculation about possible perpetrators here . 
Embassy contacts note that Politkovskaya’s work had won her many enemies . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told Embassy October 8 that the late journalist “constantly” received threats --”by telephone , letter , by e-mail , by [PER SMS.” Politkovskaya  ] had become inured to the threats . 
According to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , “she had accepted the possibility that she could be killed at any time , and talked about it very little.” The most frequent threats , [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said , had come from [LOC Chechnya  ] Prime Minister “Kadyrov’s people” ( not necessarily with Kadyrov’s knowledge ) and the [MISC Russian  ] Special Forces , whose brutalities in [LOC Chechnya  ] had been exposed by [PER Politkovskaya.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) There have been at least two criminal cases opened against people who have threatened [PER Politkovskaya  ] in the past , and she was prominent on an “enemies” list maintained by [MISC Russian  ] nationalists . 
In addition , an effort was allegedly made to poison her as she flew to the [LOC North Caucasus  ] as the [LOC Beslan  ] tragedy was unfolding in 2004 . 
Immediately after Politkovskaya’s murder , there was a flurry of speculation that the assassination was linked to an article on the use of torture in [LOC Chechnya  ] by troops loyal to [PER Ramzan Kadyrov  ] that [PER Politkovskaya  ] was to have turned over to [ORG Novaya Gazeta  ] on [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00011316 003 OF 003 October 8 . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Among the other , highly speculative theories making the rounds here: -- according to [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXXX  ] ( and others ) , the assassination is a “poisoned gift” for President [PER Putin  ] . 
It will be used by some to argue that there is a state of emergency , and that the President cannot leave when his term ends in 2008. -- others theorize that Politkovskaya’s death was tied not to Putin’s birthday , but to the thirtieth birthday of [MISC Chechnya’s  ] Premier [PER Ramzan Kadyrov  ] . 
[MISC Politikovskaya’s  ] trenchant articles on the conduct of the war in [LOC Chechnya  ] had angered [PER Kadyrov  ] and his confederates , the theory has it , and rumors that the pro-Moscow [MISC Chechen  ] leadership was to be fingered in the article that was to appear this week had caused someone to intervene . 
A corollary speculation has it that the assassination might have been engineered by [MISC Chechnya’s  ] President [PER Alu Alkhanov  ] in order to implicate , and neutralize [PER Kadyrov  ] . 
A third possibility is that those in [LOC Chechnya  ] opposed to Kadyrov’s pro-Moscow regime were attempting to use [PER Politkovskaya  ] in order to marginalize [ORG Kadyrov.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In the more implausible category: -- others argue that the assassination will be used , like journalist [PER Georgiy Gongadze’s  ] death in [LOC Ukraine  ] , as a reference point in an effort to foment a [MISC Russian  ] “orange” revolution . 
Still others suggest that her death , which follows on the heels of the assassination of Bank Deputy Chairman [PER Andrey Kozlov  ] , will provide a pretext for still tighter controls in an effort to restore order. ------------------- THE [LOC U.S.  ] CONNECTION ------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Politikovskaya  ] was a [LOC U.S.  ] citizen by birth and [LOC U.S.  ] passport holder , although she spent most of her adult life in [LOC Russia.  ] ------------ [ORG GOR  ] REACTION ------------ <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) As noted above , Prosecutor General [PER Yuriy Chayka  ] has taken personal charge of the investigation , and it appears that the authorities are moving quickly to gather evidence . 
Ambassador has been told ( septel ) by First Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Denisov  ] that the [ORG GOR  ] will issue a statement on October 9 .
