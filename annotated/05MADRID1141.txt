Robert Manzanares  ] , reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Your visit to [ORG Madrid  ] comes after a difficult year in our bilateral relationship but also at a time when we are gradually moving relations to a more positive track . 
The [ORG Madrid  ] train bombings in March 2004 came as a terrible shock to a country that felt it was accustomed to dealing with terrorism ( in the form of its 30-year conflict with [ORG ETA  ] ) and considered itself a bridge between the [MISC Islamic  ] world and the [LOC West  ] . 
Voters punished the then-ruling [ORG Popular Party  ] after the attacks out of resentment over President [PER Aznar  ] 's decision to ignore strong public opposition to the deployment of [MISC Spanish  ] forces to [LOC Iraq  ] , and for the government 's mishandling of the investigation into the train bombings . 
A year later , President [PER Zapatero  ] 's [ORG Socialist Party  ] has consolidated its control at the national level and the [ORG Popular Party  ] remains very much on the defensive. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) At the international level , [PER Zapatero  ] is working to repair relations with the [ORG USG  ] damaged by [LOC Spain  ] 's sudden and poorly coordinated pullout from [LOC Iraq  ] and by the [MISC Spanish  ] government 's sharp rhetoric against [LOC U.S.  ] policy in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
While the public strongly supported [PER Zapatero  ] 's withdrawal of troops from [LOC Iraq  ] , the Socialists' mishandling of relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] exposed the [ORG GOS  ] to media and opposition attacks . 
We are slowly putting relations back on track , though differences remain on some issues , such as [LOC Spain  ] 's unwillingness to permit the deployment of [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG NATO  ] officers to support [ORG NATO  ] operations in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Our objective is to work with [LOC Spain  ] on issues of importance to us and , where possible , to steer the [PER Zapatero  ] government away from actions that undermine [ORG USG  ] policy objectives . 
Bilateral cooperation against terrorism remained strong despite turbulence in other aspects of the relationship , as did military to military relations . 
[LOC Spain  ] continues to provide [LOC U.S.  ] forces full access to its naval base at [LOC Rota  ] and its air base at [LOC Moron  ] , as well as providing blanket flight clearances for [LOC U.S.  ] forces moving to and from [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] Foreign Minister [PER Miguel Angel Moratinos  ] and Minister of [ORG Defense  ] [PER Jose Bono  ] are scheduled to visit [LOC Washington  ] this spring for meetings with Secretary Rice and Secretary [PER Rumsfeld  ] , and the Ministers of [LOC Interior  ] and Justice are arranging meetings in [LOC Washington  ] as well . 
End Summary. ------------------------ A YEAR AFTER THE ATTACKS ------------------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) You arrive in [LOC Spain  ] just over a year after the [ORG Madrid  ] train bombings of March 11 , 2004 killed 191 people and wounded over 1600 . 
It was the worst terrorist attack ever in an [ORG EU  ] country and shook a nation that felt it was accustomed to dealing with terrorism as a result of its 30-year conflict with [ORG ETA  ] . 
Attorney General [PER Alberto Gonzales  ] 's attendance at the one-year commemoration of the bombings symbolized [ORG USG  ] support for the victims of the attack and our respect for the [MISC Spanish  ] people . 
Secretary [PER Powell  ] 's visit to [LOC Spain  ] in the wake of the 3/11 attacks was appreciated as a positive gesture , but bilateral friction between the [ORG USG  ] and the [PER Zapatero  ] government since that time has generated a public perception that the [ORG USG  ] is punishing [LOC Spain  ] for [PER Zapatero  ] 's actions . 
Both the [ORG USG  ] and the [PER Zapatero  ] government have an interest in putting relations on a more positive track and your visit is a signal that despite our differences we value [LOC Spain  ] as an ally. -------------------------------------------- SOCIALISTS IN CONTROL OF NATIONAL GOVERNMENT -------------------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The 3/11 attacks and their aftermath were a turning point in modern [MISC Spanish  ] politics . 
After taking office in 1996 , President [PER Aznar  ] led his center-right [ORG Popular Party  ] ( [ORG PP  ] ) to unprecedented power at the national and regional level . 
Although he was not a candidate in 2004 , the [ORG PP  ] was poised to win its third national election in a row , despite widespread dissatisfaction with [PER Aznar  ] 's decision to contribute forces to [MISC U.S.-led  ] operations in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
The [ORG Madrid  ] train attacks shocked the [MISC Spanish  ] public and triggered an outpouring of grief and sadness , but then anger when the [ORG PP  ] government continued to blame [ORG ETA  ] for the bombings after evidence arose pointing to [MISC Islamic  ] radicals as authors of the attacks . 
The bombings allowed the Socialists to capitalize on simmering resentment of [PER Aznar  ] 's decision to send troops to [LOC Iraq  ] , leading to a huge voter turnout and a Socialist victory. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Zapatero  ] moved quickly on his pre-election promise to withdraw [MISC Spanish  ] forces from [LOC Iraq  ] , a move widely supported by the [MISC Spanish  ] public . 
He then pressed forward on a social agenda that appealed to [LOC Spain  ] 's center-left electorate ( gay rights , curbing the power of the [MISC Catholic  ] Church , better relations with regional governments in [LOC Catalonia  ] and the [ORG Basque Region  ] ) further broadening the Socialists' appeal . 
[PER Aznar  ] and the [ORG PP  ] , meanwhile , remained unapologetic for their handling of the 3/11 bombings and declined to sideline leaders discredited by their actions in the wake of the bombings , further eroding their public support . 
[PER Zapatero  ] 's main internal challenge is an effort by the [ORG Basque Regional Government  ] ( comprised of moderate [MISC Basque  ] nationalists opposed to [ORG ETA  ] violence ) to increase its autonomy from [LOC Spain  ] 's central government . 
This is a potential powder keg since most other regions of [LOC Spain  ] strongly oppose increasing the [ORG Basque Region  ] 's already considerable independence , unless they too are given greater independence . 
[PER Zapatero  ] now enjoys an approval rating of over 60 percent and , barring a major setback , is likely to remain in power for at least one term ( until 2008 ) . 
The [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PSOE  ] ) as a whole also gets much higher marks today than the [ORG PP  ] opposition. ---------------------------- STRAINED BILATERAL RELATIONS ---------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The first eleven months of the [PER Zapatero  ] administration have proven among the most difficult in recent [MISC U.S.-Spanish  ] history . 
Throughout the most frustrating episodes , the [ORG USG  ] won points for sticking to the high road and refusing to be baited into public disputes with the [ORG GOS  ] . 
Despite our efforts , senior [ORG GOS  ] officials continued to make unhelpful remarks throughout 2004 , particularly regarding the [LOC U.S.  ] role in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] has also irritated us by leading an effort to ease [ORG EU  ] pressure on [LOC Cuba  ] and engaging the [ORG Chavez  ] government in [LOC Venezuela  ] , mainly to satisfy leftist supporters and to contrast [PER Zapatero  ] 's emphasis on " dialogue " with [PER Aznar  ] 's tougher line. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) The turning point in [PER Zapatero  ] 's approach to the [LOC U.S.  ] came when former Ambassador [PER Argyros  ] declined to attend [LOC Spain  ] 's October 12 national day parade , putting the public spotlight on our disappointment with the tone and direction of [MISC Spanish  ] foreign policy . 
This episode undermined [MISC Spanish  ] government assertions in the press that [PER Zapatero  ] 's policies had not strained ties with [LOC Washington  ] . 
This exposed [PER Zapatero  ] to withering opposition criticism that he had scuttled one of [LOC Spain  ] 's most important bilateral relationships and relegated [LOC Spain  ] to second-class status . 
While polls consistently demonstrate widespread hostility among Spaniards to [ORG USG  ] foreign policy , the public still expects the [ORG GOS  ] to maintain healthy working relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER Zapatero  ] has responded accordingly and has initiated moves to repair ties with the [MISC USG.  ] ------------------------ RECENT POSITIVE GESTURES ------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Since November , [MISC Spanish  ] officials at all levels have made clear their desire to restore strong bilateral ties , with the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] 's Director General for Foreign Policy ( under secretary equivalent ) telling us bluntly , " We want back in . 
" In response , we 've told our [MISC Spanish  ] contacts that we are prepared to move forward on issues of bilateral importance and that unambiguous , positive steps by [LOC Spain  ] would be the best signal to the [ORG USG  ] that they too were ready to move forward . 
[LOC Spain  ] subsequently agreed to [ORG USG  ] requests that it lead a Provincial Reconstruction Team and a [ORG Forward Support Base  ] in western [LOC Afghanistan  ] as part of [ORG NATO  ] 's mission in that country , issued positive statements regarding the [LOC Iraq  ] elections , and contributed $20 million to the [LOC Iraq  ] elections fund . 
[LOC Spain  ] also continues to disburse $300 million in assistance to [LOC Iraq  ] pledged during the 2003 [LOC Iraq  ] Donors Conference in [ORG Madrid  ] , and has agreed to train [MISC Iraqi  ] security forces in [LOC Spain  ] . 
We expect Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] to highlight these moves during his April 15 meeting with Secretary [PER Rice.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [ORG USG  ] has welcomed these steps , while making clear that we remain troubled by mixed signals from [LOC Spain  ] , such as continued characterizations of the conflict in [LOC Iraq  ] as " an illegal war " by senior [MISC Spanish  ] officials . 
Separately , we want [LOC Spain  ] to lift its caveats on the deployment of [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG NATO  ] officers to participate in [ORG NATO  ] missions , including in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Also , [PER Zapatero  ] is negotiating to sell naval vessels to [LOC Venezuela  ] to support [LOC Spain  ] 's troubled shipbuilding industry and [LOC Spain  ] continues to press for closer [ORG EU  ] ties with [PER Castro  ] . 
Despite these differences , we believe relations are moving in a positive direction and we want to move ahead in our significant bilateral agenda with [LOC Spain.  ] ----------------------------- COUNTER-TERRORISM COOPERATION ----------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) A critical element in our bilateral relationship is our high level of cooperation on law enforcement and counter-terrorism issues . 
[LOC Spain  ] remains an active front in the War on Terror . 
Investigations since the 3/11 attack have confirmed suspicions that there is a large pool of [MISC Islamic  ] extremists throughout the country , including one cell that plotted attacks against [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG High Court  ] and other targets during the latter half of 2004 . 
[ORG ETA  ] also continues to carry out small-scale bombings , though it has been greatly weakened in the last year by arrests of key leaders in [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC France  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] authorities arrested 117 suspected [MISC Islamic  ] terrorists during the year , routinely sharing with [ORG USG  ] officials information derived from those arrests . 
A DOJ team met with [MISC Spanish  ] counterparts in December to identify mechanisms for improving information sharing and judicial cooperation , particularly on counter-terrorism investigations . 
Attorney General [PER Gonzales  ] and Minister of [PER Justice Aguilar  ] issued a joint statement on March 11 , 2005 committing the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG GOS  ] to closer cooperation on counter-terrorism investigations . 
[PER Aguilar  ] and Minister of [ORG Interior Jose Antonio Alonso  ] had excellent meetings with Attorney General [PER Gonzales  ] . 
[PER Alonso  ] will travel to [LOC Washington  ] April 18 and [PER Aguilar  ] will visit May 5. -------------------- MILITARY COOPERATION -------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Military to military relations remain very strong despite the change in government ; the [PER Zapatero  ] government has continued to provide broad access for [LOC U.S.  ] forces to [LOC Rota Naval Base  ] ( on [LOC Spain  ] 's southern coast ) and [LOC Moron Air Base  ] ( southwest [LOC Spain  ] ) . 
There are currently over 2500 active duty [LOC U.S.  ] military stationed at the two bases , the vast majority at [LOC Rota  ] . 
The [MISC American  ] presence at the bases tops 5,000 when [LOC U.S.  ] civilians and dependents are included . 
[PER Zapatero  ] has also left untouched [LOC Spain  ] 's practice of providing blanket flight clearances for [LOC U.S.  ] military aircraft , including in support of operations in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] military is still smarting from its ignominious withdrawal from [LOC Iraq  ] and , largely as a result of the [LOC Iraq  ] withdrawal , is very unhappy with the Socialist government . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] armed forces strongly support close relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] and consider [PER Zapatero  ] 's distancing from the [LOC U.S.  ] a profound error . 
Minister of [ORG Defense Bono  ] will meet with Secretary [PER Rumsfeld  ] May 3 in [LOC Washington.  ] ------------------- BROADER MIDDLE EAST ------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The [PER Zapatero  ] government may tell you it has much to offer in finding solutions to the issues that face the Broader [LOC Middle East  ] because of [LOC Spain  ] 's proximity to the area and its experience with [MISC Islamic  ] immigrants . 
FM [PER Moratinos  ] in particular touts his experience as the [ORG EU  ] 's [LOC Middle East  ] envoy . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] speak frequently of the 10-year commemoration of the [ORG EU  ] 's [ORG Barcelona Process  ] , which will be held in [LOC Barcelona  ] this October . 
In his speech at the 2004 [MISC UNGA  ] , [PER Zapatero  ] announced a concept he called " The [ORG Alliance of Civilizations  ] , " a sketchy plan dealing with relations between the [MISC Islamic  ] world and the [LOC West  ] that remains very much undefined . 
We have told the [PER Zapatero  ] government that while we look forward to learning more about the [ORG Alliance of Civilizations  ] , it is important that proposals for greater understanding and spreading democracy in the region are consistent with other initiatives , such as the [ORG G-8  ] 's Broader [LOC Middle East  ] and [LOC North Africa  ] Initiative. --------------------------------- ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL RELATIONS --------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) We have important commercial interests in [LOC Spain  ] as well , with a business community that is staunchly supportive of [LOC U.S.  ] investment and concerned that [PER Zapatero  ] 's policies will lead to a decrease in [LOC U.S.  ] business involvement . 
At every opportunity , we work to encourage a business-friendly environment in [LOC Spain.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG GOS  ] cooperates with the [LOC U.S.  ] on terrorism finance issues . 
Working-level contacts have repeatedly sought information on pre-notifications . 
The [ORG GOS  ] checks for assets upon receiving information from us , but to date has not found such assets . 
The [ORG Interior Ministry  ] is working on implementing regulations to a terrorism finance law that will enhance the government , s ability to freeze assets. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [LOC Spain  ] is an [ORG Airbus  ] stakeholder . 
Recently , [LOC Iberia  ] chose [ORG Airbus  ] to replace a number of medium-sized jets despite extensive lobbying by the Embassy on [ORG Boeing  ] , s behalf . 
With respect to the Airbus-Boeing subsidies dispute , [MISC Spanish  ] interlocutors indicate that [LOC Spain  ] lets the [ORG Commission  ] formulate policy . 
[LOC Spain  ] was pleased that the rice issue was recently satisfactorily resolved as the retaliation contemplated by the [LOC U.S.  ] would have struck [MISC Spanish  ] olive , clementine , and saffron exports particularly hard . 
[LOC Spain  ] voted in favor of extending the reprieve on implementing the [ORG EU  ] , s wood packing directive. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [LOC Spain  ] is not on the Special 301 list . 
However , we are working to improve respect for [ORG IPR  ] in [LOC Spain  ] . 
The [ORG GOS  ] has agreed to participate in a U.S.-Spain [ORG IPR  ] roundtable scheduled for the end of June or September . 
Commerce Assistant Secretary [PER Lash  ] will lead the [LOC U.S.  ] delegation at this event . 
We are also working on agricultural biotechnology issues in [LOC Spain  ] . 
The previous government was largely positive with respect to the technology . 
The current government , s environment minister is opposed . 
In particular , we are seeking to obtain approval for [ORG Monsanto  ] 's [ORG NK  ] 603 variety , favorable [MISC Spanish  ] votes on [ORG Commission  ] proposals for biotechnology approvals ( the [ORG Zapatero  ] government has abstained on four important votes ) and a rational co-existence decree. --------------------------------------------- --------- YOUR VISIT WILL HELP KEEP RELATIONS ON POSITIVE COURSE --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) The [ORG USG  ] will not re-establish with [PER Zapatero  ] the deep and close relationship we had with the [MISC Aznar  ] administration . 
However , we are currently moving towards a more productive course that achieves [ORG USG  ] interests in [LOC Spain  ] and in other regions . 
Your visit will help us emphasize to the [ORG Zapatero  ] government and the [MISC Spanish  ] people that despite our differences with the [ORG Zapatero  ] administration , we continue to consider [LOC Spain  ] a close and important ally and , provided [LOC Spain  ] works with us , we can move ahead together on robust bilateral and multilateral agendas .
