<code><pre>C O N F I D E N T I A L SCTION 02 OF 02 SAO PAULO 000335 SIPDIS STATE FOR WHA/BSC , [ORG WHA/EPSC  ] , [ORG EEB/ESC  ] USDOC FOR 4332/ITA/MAC/WH/OLAC/JANDERSON/ADRISCOLL/MWAR D DEPT OF TREASURY FOR JHOEK NSC FOR [MISC TOMASULO E.O.  ] 12958: [LOC DECL:  ] 03/14/2018 TAGS: <a href='/tag/ECON_0.html'>ECON</a> <a href='/tag/ENRG_0.html'>ENRG</a> <a href='/tag/EPET_0.html'>EPET</a> <a href='/tag/PGOV_0.html'>PGOV</a> <a href='/tag/EINV_0.html'>EINV</a> <a href='/tag/EAGR_0.html'>EAGR</a> <a href='/tag/BR_0.html'>BR</a> SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES BRAZILIAN OIL CONCESSION MODEL WITH DELFIM NETTO the concession model and even more unlikely that it would choose to change the rules on existing concessions . 
Political and economic stability have been the cornerstones of [LOC Brazil  ] 's policies and largely led to [LOC Brazil  ] obtaining investment grade status ( Ref D ) . 
While some modification of exploration and concession rules may take place for these new " mega fields " , it is doubtful the [ORG GOB  ] would do anything to undermine the overall image of [LOC Brazil  ] as a stable country in which to invest. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>Â¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Unlike [PER Delfim Netto  ] 's view that the [ORG USG  ] should hold off on intervening to establish these new rules , [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Ministry of Mines and Energy  ] , regulators , and [ORG US  ] energy companies have suggested that it could instead be within this period for the [ORG USG  ] to intervene . 
Indeed , [ORG Petrobras'  ] interest in consolidating deep-sea drilling in the [LOC Gulf  ] of [LOC Mexico  ] and vertical integration in the [ORG US  ] market could open an important window of opportunity for the [ORG USG  ] . 
Furthermore , [ORG ANP  ] has expressed interest in learning more about [ORG US  ] small and medium sized energy companies operating in [LOC US  ] states to develop a similar capacity in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
They have , in fact , asked for [ORG USG  ] assistance to travel to the [ORG US  ] to meet with and further learn about this important part of the energy equation . 
Clearly , [LOC Brazil  ] 's energy sector offers new partnerships , opportunities , and increased energy security for the [ORG US  ] . 
As [LOC Brazil  ] begins to increase exploration of its newfound " pre-salt " reserves that many believe could be larger than the finds in the [LOC North Sea  ] , the [ORG US  ] could potentially capitalize on these new technologies to develop our own offshore exploration efforts . 
Early engagement may be crucial to ensuring that [ORG US  ] firms will have opportunities in this market .
