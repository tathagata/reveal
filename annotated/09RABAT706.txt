Jackson  ] for reasons 1 .4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary: Although the  ] [LOC Western Sahara  ] negotiations have now re-started ( Reftel ) , the conflict is 34 years old . 
The Government of [LOC Morocco  ] ( [ORG GOM  ] ) has invested tremendous resources in the territory , and some observers estimate that it spends USD 2.7 billion per year on the territory and its 385,000 residents . 
The level of development and of social services clearly exceeds the level in [LOC Morocco  ] proper . 
Significant voter participation ) - despite a [MISC Polisario  ] call for a boycott -- in the June 12 local elections may be a sign that support for independence is waning although support for self-government is real . 
Serious human rights abusers have been transferred , and respect for human rights in the territory has greatly improved , reaching the same plane as in [LOC Morocco  ] . 
However , advocating independence is still a red line , and the [ORG GOM  ] refuses to register pro-Polisario [ORG NGOs  ] . 
Giving the territory more autonomy , improving [MISC Algerian-Moroccan  ] relations , enhancing regional integration , building real confidence , and addressing all parties , propaganda seem essential to resolving the conflict . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Since King [PER Hassan II  ] launched the [LOC Green March  ] in 1975 , the [LOC Western Sahara  ] issue has been intimately linked to the stability of the throne and [LOC Morocco  ] itself . 
[PER Hassan  ] , twice victim of coup attempts and for years at war with the left , used [LOC Western Sahara  ] to bolster nationalism and park his army far away in the desert . 
More recently , however , that link has blurred . 
King [PER Mohammed VI  ] is more secure , maintained in power more by love than fear and facing no apparent major domestic threat . 
He recently has somewhat distanced himself from the issue , however , and has not visited the territory in three years , a stark contrast to his peripatetic ribbon cutting throughout the [MISC Kingdom.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOM  ] continues to subsidize the territory and provide tax and duty exemptions that form the base of much of the private fortunes there ( mostly key clans loyal to the throne and a few senior military ) . 
Despite some siphoning , the investment has produced higher levels of urban development than in comparably sized cities in [LOC Morocco  ] proper and made the capital , [LOC Laayoune  ] , the first city without any shantytowns . 
Social indicators such as access to and level of education and availability of health care and social facilities exceed [MISC Moroccan  ] norms and far surpass those in comparably sized [LOC Morocco  ] , s cities . 
Growth in [LOC Morocco  ] has made these expenditures much more bearable to [LOC Rabat  ] , s exchequer than they once were. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( SBU ) In April 2009 , a local weekly newsmagazine [ORG TelQuel  ] published an article laying out and likely even exaggerating what the [LOC Sahara  ] was costing [LOC Morocco  ] . 
[ORG TelQuel  ] claimed that the [ORG GOM  ] has spent 1.2 trillion dirhams on the territory since 1975 and is spending 3 percent of GDP or USD 2.7 billion per year , including the funds to maintain two-thirds of the [ORG Royal Armed Forces  ] in [LOC Western Sahara  ] . 
( Note: [ORG TelQuel  ] faced no consequences for the article . 
Even with the relative expansion of the freedom of the press in [LOC Morocco  ] to cover subjects formerly taboo , this was astonishing . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) In the June 12 local elections , &First [PER Friend8 Fouad Ali  ] el [PER Himma  ] , s [ORG Party of Authenticity and Modernity  ] ( [ORG PAM  ] ) challenged local [LOC Laayoune  ] strongman and [ORG Royal Consultative Council for Saharan Affairs  ] ( [ORG CORCAS  ] ) head [PER Kalihenna Ould  ] er [PER Rachid  ] . 
The [ORG PAM  ] lost , despite having an el [PER Himma  ] protege installed . 
The [PER Ould  ] er [PER Rachid  ] family and clan control the [MISC Tammany Hall-like  ] Istiqlal party machine that has run the territory for many years , and played a major part in winning the Prime Minister , s chair for party head [PER Abbas El Fassi  ] . 
Voter participation in the [LOC Sahara  ] , stoked by clan rivalries , was far above the norm , despite a [MISC Polisario-declared  ] boycott . 
Some pro-independence [MISC Sahrawis  ] reportedly voted for the [PER Ould  ] er [PER Rachid  ] because they alone were deemed strong enough to stand up to the government in [LOC Rabat  ] . 
This real political competition , while perhaps not democracy , seems far more open than the Cuba-like [MISC Polisario  ] system . 
It underscores the fact that there is a significant part of the population of the [MISC Sahrawi  ] territory , in addition to most immigrants , who support [MISC Moroccan  ] sovereignty. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) After it took control of [LOC Western Sahara  ] , [LOC Morocco  ] tried to affect any vote by promoting immigration by its nationals , who now are well over half of the some 385,000 residents of the territory . 
Perhaps half of the immigrants , however , were themselves [MISC Sahrawis  ] , from areas just north of the dividing line that were also home to some of the most nationalistic [MISC Sahrawis  ] . 
In a referendum that could include independence , they are not seen by the [ORG GOM  ] as reliable voters , partly explaining [ORG GOM  ] reluctance to go to a vote . 
( Comment: Curiously , we know of no advocate of independence that has ever claimed the &Sahrawi8 territories in [LOC Morocco  ] , [LOC Algeria  ] or [LOC Mauritania  ] as part of a national homeland , although some members of the [ORG CORCAS  ] unsuccessfully tried to include the [MISC Moroccan  ] parts in the autonomous region , when it was first proposed . 
The absence of such larger nationalism , along with the [MISC Polisario  ] , s 1970 , s war against [LOC Mauritania  ] --the world , s only [MISC Sahrawi  ] state -- suggest the conflict is less nationalist than geopolitical , linked to the much older dispute between [LOC Algeria  ] and [LOC Morocco  ] , and hardly boosts the case for an independent state . 
End Comment . 
) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Given the small population at stake , [LOC Spain  ] , s granting of [MISC Spanish  ] nationality , with the possibility of migrating to [LOC Spain  ] , its nearby [LOC Canary Islands  ] or elsewhere in [LOC Europe  ] , is significant , and , indeed in better times , resettlement could be a simple way of resolving the plight of the refugees. ----------- Who Counts ? ----------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The [ORG UN  ] process recognizes the parties in the negotiations as [LOC Morocco  ] and the [MISC Polisario  ] . 
This asymmetry makes any resolution difficult , as it does not recognize the determinative role of [LOC Algiers  ] , which the [MISC Moroccans  ] see as their real adversary in this dispute . 
It also neglects the diverse views among the [LOC Sahrawis.  ] --------------------------------------------- - [ORG Human Rights: Progress but Continuing Paranoia  ] --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) The human rights situation in the territory has dramatically improved since a brief &intifada8 in 2005 . 
Like [LOC Morocco  ] itself , [LOC Western Sahara  ] has come a very long way from the mass disappearances of the &years of lead8 during [PER Hassan II  ] , s reign . 
Pro-Polisario [MISC Sahrawis  ] are able to organize under the rubric of human rights activists , which most of them legitimately pursue , such as last year , s [ORG RFK  ] award winner , [PER Aminatou Haidar  ] from the [ORG Sahrawi Collective of Human Rights Defenders  ] ( [ORG CODESA  ] ) . 
In just over a year , restrictions on their international travel have disappeared. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Since mid-2008 , once common beatings and arbitrary imprisonment have also essentially ceased . 
One key to the reduction in abuses last year was the transfer of long-serving security officials with consistent records as abusers . 
Activists and officials confirmed in July 2009 that more transfers ( many by promotion ) had recently taken place , and most well known abusers are reportedly now gone . 
All sources report the territory is quiet , with residents hopeful for some political progress. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) What opponents of [LOC Morocco  ] cannot do is explicitly organize in favor of independence or a referendum thereon , nor can they publish or even distribute tracts on the subject . 
In addition , they are denied by the government the right to operate as legal entities . 
Establishing these rights would not only be just , but would help build confidence in a consensual solution that would involve re-integration . 
The [ORG Sahrawi Association of Human Rights Victims  ] ( [ORG ASVDH  ] ) has even obtained court approval for its registration as an [ORG NGO  ] and won on appeal lodged by the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] ( [ORG MOI  ] ) , but has not been able to get local officials to accept its registration . 
The [ORG USG  ] has pushed for this for some time . 
We recently heard that the local [MISC Wali  ] has proposed to [ORG MOI  ] that it accept the registration but the decision is pending . 
We should press the [ORG GOM  ] on this both here and in [LOC Washington.  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Despite this substantial progress , which leaves the human rights situation in [LOC Western Sahara  ] nearly equivalent to [LOC Morocco  ] , [LOC Morocco  ] campaigned for most of the year and spent scarce diplomatic capital in a successful effort to push back proposals for the [ORG UN  ] to have a monitoring role on this issue . 
It is possible that they have understood the opportunity costs of that strategy and appear more recently to have been somewhat less vocal on the issue. -------------------- What the [MISC People Want  ] -------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Extensive interviews and independent sources in the territory suggest that the principal goal of most [PER Sahrawis  ] is more self-government than self-determination ; a desire more for protection and identity than independence , an army and embassies . 
The small vocally pro-Polisario minority , including many of the human rights activists , formerly enjoyed the support of the &silent majority8 of these [MISC Sahrawis  ] , particularly during periods of repression . 
Development and reduced oppression have reduced this support . 
The [MISC Sahrawi  ] &silent majority8 in the territory has been intrigued by the prospect of autonomy and has generally quietly awaited its development . 
Recently , a pro-Polisario activist , when asked , confided to us that he believed that in a free election held now a majority of voters in the territory would choose autonomy. ----------------------------- On the [MISC Other Side of  ] the [LOC Berm  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) While not the competent Mission to comment on the [MISC Polisario  ] or the camps , Embassy [LOC Rabat  ] understands the situation for the refugees in [LOC Tindouf  ] is difficult but support for the [MISC Polisario  ] appears strong . 
Nevertheless , we hear from credible [MISC Sahrawis  ] that there is growing interest there in a negotiated solution , belying the stories of unrealistic saber-rattling , frequently attributed to [MISC Sahrawi  ] youth . 
[ORG GOM  ] calls for a census and audit of international programs seem reasonable to us . 
Finally , if there is no prospect of a solution , re-settlement should be considered an option . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] decision in 2008 to accord passports to 1975 residents of its former colony could be implemented in [LOC Tindouf  ] as it has been in [LOC Laayoune  ] ( but not in the current economic climate ) . ------------------- Frozen Negotiations ------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) Meanwhile , the [ORG UN  ] Secretary General , s Personal Envoy for [LOC Western Sahara  ] has struggled to get the [ORG UN  ] negotiations back on track . 
The negotiation process re-started in 2007 , after [LOC Morocco  ] tabled a proposal for autonomy that had been carefully negotiated with the [ORG Bush Administration  ] . 
The main impetus to getting the plan produced was then-USUN Permrep [PER John Bolton  ] , s threat ( October 2006 ) to end [ORG MINURSO  ] , s mandate . 
When first released , the [ORG USG  ] called the autonomy proposal &serious and credible.8 In substance , the proposal was serious , including local police and some independence for the judiciary , and was accompanied by a declared willingness to negotiate . 
It was also viewed as credible by the international community , including explicitly [LOC Russia  ] and implicitly [LOC China  ] , which nearly universally expressed a willingness to accept this as a possible outcome , if agreed . 
Credibility was an issue , however , among [PER Sahrawis  ] on both sides of the berm , as there was little confidence , given past [MISC Moroccan  ] evasions , that even if agreed , the [ORG GOM  ] would implement the plan . 
This credibility gap has narrowed , but only slightly , due to the improvements in the human rights situation . 
Credibility is , therefore , key to winning hearts and minds. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) In April 2007 , the [ORG United Nations Security Council  ] lengthened the mandate of [ORG MINURSO  ] to 12 months ( from six ) and the &Manhasset talks8 ( named after the [LOC Long Island  ] , [LOC New York  ] town where they were held ) began . 
The [MISC Moroccans  ] , while negotiating with the [MISC Polisario  ] , showed them no credence and sent [MISC Moroccan  ] [PER Sahrawis  ] to seek defectors . 
CORCAS head [PER Kalihenna  ] questioned the [MISC Polisario  ] , s right to be there . 
The [MISC Polisario  ] broke diplomatic and [LOC Middle Eastern  ] protocol by refusing to shake hands with the [MISC Sahrawis  ] on the [MISC Moroccan  ] delegation and walked out or turned away when they spoke. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Neither side offered any compromise or considered the arguments of the other . 
This was hardened when , at the end of 2007 , King [PER Mohammed VI  ] publicly instructed his delegation to discuss no solution but autonomy , creating little room for discussion . 
This hard-line stance may have been bolstered by what was perceived in the Palace as uncritical support from [LOC Washington  ] . 
In the end , there was no result after four rounds of rotating restatement of static positions . 
Former [ORG UN  ] Personal Envoy [PER Peter Van Walsum  ] cited immovable [MISC Moroccan  ] commitment to retain sovereignty , and called the prospect of independence unrealistic . 
For this unusual frankness , the [ORG UN  ] let [PER Van Walsum  ] go , at [MISC Algerian  ] and [MISC Polisario  ] insistence. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( C ) The new Personal Envoy , Ambassador [PER Christopher Ross  ] , long one of the stars of [LOC U.S.  ] diplomacy in the region , seems better positioned than anyone to budge President [PER Bouteflika  ] and his government . 
In recognition , he was granted the additional mandate to help improve [MISC Moroccan-Algerian  ] relations . 
King [PER Mohammed VI  ] took note of this and conveyed through [PER Ross  ] an offer of unconditional , at-any-level and on-any-subject , bilateral talks . 
[PER Ross  ] did get [LOC Algeria  ] to agree to go to the &informals8 but only as observers . 
He got no response on the bilateral issue , although it is still early in [PER Bouteflika  ] , s new term . 
The informal meeting this month in [LOC Vienna  ] has at least re-launched the negotiations. --------------------------------------------- -------- Regional Link: Algeria-Morocco Key to [MISC Sahara Solution  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( C ) [LOC Algeria  ] and [LOC Morocco  ] are demographically similar but with differences in historical experience that go back hundreds of years . 
About a year after [LOC Algeria  ] , s hard-won independence , it and [LOC Morocco  ] fought &The War of the Sands , 8 over their then-disputed frontier , drawn by colonial [LOC France  ] . 
In 1975 , when the [MISC Algerians  ] sheltered the [MISC Polisario  ] , it was at least as much a reflection of their historical rivalry as ideological support for a fellow liberation movement . 
King [PER Hassan II  ] managed to work out a frontier agreement with the [MISC Algerians  ] which the [ORG GOM  ] maintains has been ratified , and needs only an exchange of instruments of ratification . 
The subsequent closure of the [MISC Algeria-Moroccan  ] border is now an anomaly in a [MISC Mediterranean  ] region of growing links . 
There have been modestly growing functional links in recent years , much of it under [ORG Arab Maghreb Union  ] auspices and in 2008 some technical agreements were signed . 
But direct high-level communication remains cut and both quiet and public [ORG GOM  ] overtures to reopen it have been rebuffed . 
The Government of [LOC Algeria  ] ( [ORG GOA  ] ) turned down then-Secretary Rice , s invitation for a trilateral ministerial meeting on the margins of the 2008 [MISC UNGA.  ] ------- Comment ------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( C ) [LOC Algeria  ] , [LOC Morocco  ] and the [LOC Western Sahara  ] dispute is a chicken and egg situation . 
[LOC Algeria  ] has indicated relations cannot improve until there is self-determination in [LOC Western Sahara  ] . 
[LOC Morocco  ] , following the close links between the [MISC Polisario  ] leadership and their [MISC Algerian  ] hosts , remains convinced that there will be no agreement if relations with [LOC Algiers  ] do not improve . 
In response , as of June 2009 , the [MISC Moroccans  ] have maintained that their principal goal now is rapprochement with [LOC Algeria  ] , which could be discussed separately. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( C ) The international community is ready to support [ORG Maghreb  ] rapprochement and integration , which can only occur in parallel with a settlement of the longstanding dispute over the [LOC Western Sahara  ] and resettlement of the long-suffering refugees . 
[PER Then-President Putin  ] of [LOC Russia  ] urged [MISC Algerian-Moroccan  ] compromise in vain , as have the [MISC French  ] , the [MISC Spanish  ] , and the [ORG USG  ] . 
We are not aware of any of the [MISC P-5  ] opposing an autonomy-based solution , nor have we seen real urgency or priority for the international community to resolve a dispute over which there has been no real fighting for 18 years .
