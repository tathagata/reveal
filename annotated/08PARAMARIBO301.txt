END SUMMARY. ------------------------------- Famous Faces , Familiar Rhetoric ------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) On July 5 , the mammoth bloc - the popular term for the new political combination that has no official name as yet - was officially brought to life at a [ORG National Democratic Pary  ] ( [ORG NDP  ] ) -style rally . 
The combination consists of the [ORG NDP  ] led by [PER Desi Bouterse  ] , the [ORG Democratic National Platform  ] 2000 ( [ORG DNP-2000  ] ) led by former President [PER Jules Wijdenbosch  ] , the [ORG Party for Development and Democracy  ] ( [ORG BVD  ] ) led by wealthy businessman [PER Dilip Sardjoe  ] , the [ORG Progressive Workers and Farm Laborers Union  ] ( [ORG PALU  ] ) led by intellectual [PER Jim Hok  ] , and the [ORG Party of National Unity and Solidarity  ] led by [PER Javanese  ] splinter-politician [PER Willy Soemita  ] . 
The five chairmen underlined the importance of unity in politics and criticized the [ORG Venetiaan/Sardjoe  ] government for their gas , food , housing , and education policies . 
[PER Dilip Sardjoe  ] predicted that the new combination would win at least 40 of the 51 seats in [LOC Parliament.  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- Invocations: from [PER Sinatra  ] to [PER Guevara  ] , [PER Obama  ] to [PER Chavez  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) A predominantly youthful audience of a few thousand attended the mass meeting in the [ORG NDP  ] party center . 
It featured performances by popular music groups , with [PER Bouterse  ] appearing on stage singing I did it my way and repeatedly using [PER Barack Obama  ] 's yes we can election slogan . 
[PER Bouterse  ] , wearing a [PER Che Guevara  ] t-shirt ( he is an admirer of [PER Fidel Castro  ] and [PER Hugo Chavz  ] ) , told his audience that it is time to make [LOC South America  ] more red . 
Referring to elections in [LOC Bolivia  ] , [LOC Chile  ] , and [LOC Argentina  ] , [PER Bouterse  ] reiterated that it was time for [LOC Suriname  ] to also move to the left. -------------------- [ORG Coalition Skepticism  ] -------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Kortencia Sumter-Griffith  ] , one of the leading ladies within President [PER Runaldo Venetiaan  ] 's NPS ( [ORG National Party of Suriname  ] ) , told [MISC Embassy  ] staff that [PER Bouterse  ] 's speech was nothing but populist rhetoric and that he was only able to draw such large crowds because of the popular music bands . 
Sumter - [PER Griffith  ] predicted the combination would not last since neither [PER Bouterse  ] nor [PER Wijdenbosch  ] , whose relationship has run the gambit from personal friends to foes and are now back together again , would not accept the other 's political leadership . 
[PER Guno Castelen  ] , Member of [LOC Parliament  ] and Secretary of the [ORG Labor Party  ] , suggested the new combination could pose a threat to the ruling coalition . 
He pointed out , however , that the [PER Venetiaan  ] government has brought economic stability and said he does not think that voters will opt for the inflation and corruption that the 1996 - 1999 government , led by the [ORG NDP  ] with [PER Wijdenbosch  ] as President , was known for. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) COMMENT . 
While it is true the [ORG New Front Plus  ] coalition led by President [PER Venetiaan  ] brought back economic stability and rule of law that was absent under [PER Wijdenbosch  ] 's leadership , [PER Venetiaan  ] 's government remains deeply unpopular . 
The mammoth bloc has yet to present an election platform but enjoys popular support across a broad demographic . 
Yet victory also will not be easy for the bloc . 
The [MISC Surinamese  ] voter tends to vote against rather than for , and whether it votes against the current villains of President [PER Venetiaan  ] and his supposedly do-nothing government or against the older villains of blood-and-drug-stained [PER Bouterse  ] and his bloc is a question whose answer will be another two years in the making . 
END COMMENT .
