( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary . 
The [ORG National Civil Aviation Agency  ] ( [ORG ANAC  ] ) was formally inaugurated in a March 20 ceremony in [LOC Brasilia  ] . 
Emboffs met with [ORG ANAC  ] officials March 16 to discuss the agency 's plans for the airline industry . 
Settled are issues like where the agency will be headquartered -- [LOC Brasilia  ] -- and the powers it will wield , those which were once the domain of several [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] agencies , including the ministry 's soon-to-be [ORG defunct Civil Aviation Department  ] ( [ORG DAC  ] ) . 
Unsettled are issues regarding funding , how it will interact with related government agencies and what to do with [LOC Brazil  ] 's ailing flagship airline [ORG VARIG  ] , which is operating under bankruptcy-law protection . 
[ORG ANAC  ] is closely examining the [ORG VARIG  ] problem and hopes it can be settled soon . 
Other GoB entities worry that [ORG ANAC  ] might poach on their turf . 
Leaders at [ORG INFRAERO  ] , the parastatal that manages [LOC Brazil  ] 's airports , expressed concern about [ORG ANAC  ] diverting both funding and political power from the organization . 
[ORG Ministry of Development  ] , Industry and [ORG External Trade  ] ( [ORG MDIC  ] ) officials expressed concern about how [ORG ANAC  ] could change the face of air regulation in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
For their part , [ORG ANAC  ] representatives plan to visit [LOC Washington  ] to meet with [ORG FAA  ] officials in April/May 2006 and post supports these efforts . 
End Summary . 
[ORG ANAC  ] is Born ------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The first new regulatory agency created under the [PER Lula Administration  ] , the [ORG National Civil Aviation Agency  ] ( [ORG ANAC  ] ) is now up and running . 
Its directors assumed office on March 20 , 2006 when President [ORG Lula  ] signed the agency 's mandate in a public ceremony . 
At the ceremony , the President thanked the [ORG Department of Civil Aviation  ] ( [ORG DAC  ] ) for its role in bringing [MISC Brazilian  ] civil aviation to this point , and directed [ORG ANAC  ] to move it forward . 
Emboffs met with [ORG ANAC  ] directors [PER Leur Lomanto  ] and [PER Denise Abreu  ] on March 16 at their temporary headquarters at the [LOC Brasilia International  ] airport . 
Our interlocutors noted that full [ORG ANAC  ] operations will not begin until 2007 . 
They said that [ORG DAC  ] personnel , the majority of whom are military officers and enlisted men , will initially be subsumed into [ORG ANAC  ] but then incrementally replaced with civilians ; [ORG ANAC  ] should be a completely civilian-staffed agency by 2012 , barring delays . 
[ORG ANAC  ] directors are planning a trip to [LOC Washington  ] to visit the [ORG FAA  ] in April/May 2006 to discuss regulatory and technical issues . 
The Trouble with [ORG VARIG  ] ---------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The first and most troublesome item on the [ORG ANAC  ] agenda is [ORG VARIG  ] , the ailing [MISC Brazilian  ] airline plagued by serious debt issues ( USD 3 billion ) . 
[ORG ANAC  ] views [ORG VARIG  ] as a potential target for some " readjustments , " according to [PER Denise Abreu  ] , and the agency plans to assign an expert to study [ORG VARIG  ] 's situation and then make recommendations to an [ORG ANAC  ] review board . 
During the March 16 meeting , [PER Abreu  ] pointedly asked Ambassador [PER Alexander Watson  ] , a consultant for [ORG Boeing  ] , if [ORG ANAC  ] were to " reassign " [ORG VARIG  ] routes to other [MISC Brazilian  ] airlines , whether [ORG Boeing  ] would transfer the aircraft currently under lease to [ORG VARIG  ] to these airlines . 
She implied that [ORG Boeing  ] is at least partially responsible for many of [ORG VARIG  ] 's current financial woes , including the legal actions in [LOC U.S.  ] courts seeking seizure of the carrier 's leased aircraft . 
Ambassador [PER Watson  ] responded that he could not speak for [ORG Boeing  ] , but that he could pose the question to [ORG Boeing  ] management . 
Safety Issues ------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) Three recent incidents under investigation by [ORG DAC  ] and [ORG INFRAERO  ] show how much work [ORG ANAC  ] faces . 
On February 13 , just after takeoff from [LOC Sao Paulo  ] [LOC Guarulhos Airport  ] , a 5 inch by 7 inch , two pound piece of a [ORG VARIG Boeing  ] 737 engine fell into an elderly couple 's kitchen . 
Luckily , no one was hurt and authorities do not believe that [ORG Boeing  ] holds any liability for the incident . 
The incident occurred after [ORG VARIG  ] began implementing a restructuring plan to free up funding to bring back into service some planes previously out of commission due to safety reasons. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) On March 22 , at [LOC Sao Paulo  ] [LOC Congonhas Airport  ] , [LOC Brazil  ] 's busiest , a [PER BRA Transportes  ] ( a small domestic carrier ) plane skidded off the runway onto the taxiway during rainy weather after the pilot [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000631 002 OF 002 turned sharply to avoid heading down an embankment and onto the busy road below . 
This incident occurred less than a week after the new head of [ORG INFRAERO  ] disclosed that financial shortfalls would limit the organization 's ability to upgrade airport facilities in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
[ORG INFRAERO  ] officials announced March 28 that [LOC Congonhas  ] traffic will be cut 50% to allow for further upgrades , such as rubber and oil removal from the runways and runway expansion . 
[LOC Sao Paulo  ] 's [LOC Guarulhos  ] airport will receive two-thirds of the diverted traffic and [LOC Campinas Viracopos  ] airport , about 90 minutes away from [LOC Sao Paulo  ] 's center , will receive one-third . 
The same night of the announcement , officials diverted a [ORG TAM Airbus  ] plane with a hail-damaged nose cone from its planned landing at [LOC Congonhas  ] to [LOC Guarulhos  ] , citing the longer runway and better conditions in inclement weather . 
All of the incidents are still under investigation . 
Sometimes Hostile Colleagues ---------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG ANAC  ] also faces financial challenges . 
The [ORG DAC  ] , most of whose functions [ORG ANAC  ] is assuming , was funded out of the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] budget , but [ORG ANAC  ] will not be . 
Proposals to fund [ORG ANAC  ] out of airport taxes and landing fees have drawn opposition from [ORG INFRAERO  ] , the manager and operator of [MISC Brazilian  ] airports , and itself primarily a military entity . 
[ORG INFRAERO  ] convinced members of the [MISC Brazilian  ] congress that ceding 50 percent of the international flight airport taxes it currently keeps ( the other half goes into the general GoB coffers ) to [ORG ANAC  ] would overburden [ORG INFRAERO  ] and got this provision deleted from the legislation creating [ORG ANAC  ] prior to passage . 
The new head of [ORG INFRAERO  ] , [PER Brigadier Jose Carlos Pereira  ] , has opined publicly that [ORG ANAC  ] will compete with [ORG INFRAERO  ] for GoB attention and funding. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Meanwhile , a [ORG Ministry of Development  ] , Industry and [ORG External  ] trade representative ( [ORG MDIC  ] ) told emboffs that [ORG ANAC  ] will " cause trouble " with the agency 's new regulatory efforts to liberalize the airline industry , but was unspecific as to how [ORG ANAC  ] might prove problematic . 
Finally , [ORG DAC  ] officers at the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] told emboffs that the creation of [ORG ANAC  ] has been its priority of late . 
The reassignment of profitable routes , of great interest to international and national carriers , and a priority prior to the [ORG ANAC  ] legislation , has now taken a back seat . 
The [ORG Ministry 's  ] future role will focus on policy and air-traffic control while regulations , authorizations , registrations will fall under [ORG ANAC  ] 's purview . 
[ORG ANAC  ] will also take over the duties of certifying aircraft , currently performed by the [ORG Aerospace Technical Center  ] ( [ORG CTA  ] ) in the [ORG Airforce Command  ] . 
Comment ------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG ANAC  ] has gotten off to a bumpy start . 
Although the fifth and final director has not yet been named , at least the 5-year period for completing the transition to civilian personnel seems to have satisfied the requirements of [MISC Brazilian  ] law and concerned [ORG DAC  ] officials . 
While [ORG ANAC  ] 's permanent headquarters will be located in [LOC Brasilia  ] - meaning that any diplomatic or official contact between the [ORG USG  ] and that agency will have to take place in [LOC Brasilia  ] -- the agency 's final structure has not yet been decided . 
Resolution of its funding situation will determine how much bite will accompany its bark and could settle how well it will relate to its peer agencies . 
Whether transfer of [ORG VARIG  ] routes and [ORG Boeing  ] planes to other operators can really occur is an open question . 
In any event , pressing agenda items such as increased traffic , market efficiency and safety concerns , mean that [ORG ANAC  ] will have little time to make adjustments . 
Post reiterates its support for building this relationship and encourages [ORG FAA  ] , [ORG TSA  ] and others to reach out to [ORG ANAC  ] during this critical phase of its development .
