( U ) The two [ORG Folha  ] articles state that the meeting between President [PER Obama  ] and President [PER Lula  ] was surrounded by the same expectation from both sides: that it would mark the beginning of a cordial and close relationship between the two leaders . 
Stories highlight that President [PER Lula  ] was the third head of state to meet President [PER Obama  ] at the [LOC White House  ] . 
Diplomats from both countries say the choice of meeting with [PER Lula  ] shows that [LOC Brazil  ] is stable politically and economically ; that it an undisputed leader in [LOC Latin America  ] and also an emerging country in the global arena . 
During the joint press avail , in what has been labeled a gaffe by the press , [PER Lula  ] told reporters he did not want to be holding the " hot potato " the [LOC U.S.  ] president has in his hands , prompting [PER Obama  ] to laugh and tell [PER Lula  ] that " it sounds like you 've been talking to my wife . 
" By-liners remembered that in 2007 President [PER Lula  ] caused then President [PER Bush  ] to laugh when he stated that [LOC Brazil  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] had reached the " [MISC G-spot  ] " of the bilateral relations .

Comments from [ORG MFA  ] and former [MISC Brazilian  ] Ambassadors --------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Estado story states that last week when trying to summarize the [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] bilateral relations , Foreign Minister [PER Celso Amorim  ] acknowledged that the agenda has shown small progress , aside from the cooperation in the energy sector . 
Paper says that the stall in relations dates to the [MISC Clinton-Cardoso  ] era . 
Estado points out that since [PER Lula  ] first met [PER Bush  ] in 2003 promising a successful conclusion to the [ORG FTAA  ] , the trade accord fell through the cracks , the [ORG Doha Round  ] 's hows no vital signs' and [LOC Brazil  ] had no other path to negotiate opening of the [LOC U.S.  ] market . 
[LOC Brazil  ] 's claim for support towards a seat as a permanent member of the [ORG UN Security Council  ] has also gone unanswered , says story citing that when asked about it in 2006 , A/S [PER Thomas Shannon  ] " choked , took a step back , laughed and did not respond . 
" At the same time , Estado affirms that in 2005 the [LOC White House  ] unsuccessfully tried to engage [LOC Brazil  ] in a partnership to stop democracy from eroding in [LOC Latin America  ] . 
By refusing to intervene , [LOC Brazil  ] received the [LOC White House  ] 's blessings to deal with regional leaders , thus consolidating its hegemony in [LOC South America  ] . 
Two former [MISC Brazilian  ] ambassadors to the [LOC U.S.  ] --Roberto [PER Abdenur  ] and [PER Rubens Barbosa-commented  ] on the meeting between Presidents [PER Obama  ] and [PER Lula  ] . 
[PER Roberto Abdenur  ] expressed optimism and said even if the two do not enjoy the same " impressive chemistry " displayed by [PER Lula  ] and [PER Bush  ] ; the link between the two countries is determined more by concrete facts than by personal ties . 
[PER Abdenur  ] also believes that since [LOC Brazil  ] overcame the issue of the external debt , the [LOC U.S.  ] started regarding the country as a leader with the potential to become a partner , thus becoming " part of the solution . 
" Meanwhile , [PER Rubens Barbosa  ] states that he believes the meeting will not solve the pending issues between the two countries , but it positions [LOC Brazil  ] as a " privileged interlocutor " of the [LOC U.S.  ] administration .
