[PER Al-Tabtabae  ] is is a leading [MISC Salafist-leaning  ] member of the [MISC Kuwaiti  ] Parliament , is a frequent and vocal critic of [LOC U.S.  ] policies , and has a very high media profile . 
[MISC Kuwaiti  ] Salafists , with whom [PER Al-Tabtabae  ] is usually associated , are ultra-conservative and oppose many aspects of [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy , but like most [MISC Kuwaitis  ] for the most part favor a continued [LOC U.S.  ] military presence in [LOC Kuwait  ] as a bulwark against the ambitions of covetous larger neighbors. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S/NF ) Though [PER Al-Tabtabae  ] is often at odds politically with the [LOC United States  ] , and has met with senior members of [ORG Hamas  ] , Post is not aware of credible evidence indicating his participation in or facilitation of terrorism , and notes that the single intel piece available through TIDE indicates only an indirect linkage , and source is of low quality. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In revoking [PER Al-Tabtabae  ] , s visa , we risk creating a public cause clbre in [LOC Kuwait  ] that would enable critics of [LOC U.S.  ] policy like [PER Al-Tabtabae  ] and his fellow-travelers in the ultra-conservative/Salafist movement in [LOC Kuwait  ] to portray the revocation as punishment of those who disagree with [LOC U.S.  ] policy by labeling them &terrorists.8 <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Action Request: Post requests Department reconsider this revocation .
