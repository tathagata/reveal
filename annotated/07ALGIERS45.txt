ALGIERS 30 Classified By: DCM [PER Thomas F. Daughton  ] ; reasons 1.4 b/d <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [PER Abdelkader Bensalah  ] was re-elected , 129-0 , as the President of the [ORG Conseil de la Nation  ] ( [ORG Senate  ] ) on January 12 . 
[PER Bensalah  ] remains first in line to succeed President [PER Bouteflika  ] in the event that he is unable to complete his current term . 
[PER Bensalah  ] 's re-election became a foregone conclusion when no other senator challenged him for the post . 
A reporter for [MISC French-language  ] daily newspaper [ORG Liberte  ] , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , who covered all aspects of the election , told us the result was predetermined once President [PER Bouteflika  ] signaled to the senators that he wanted [PER Bensalah  ] to retain his position . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said senators privately complained that , out of respect to [PER Bouteflika  ] , no other candidates had presented themselves . 
Many told her the election became a formality rather than an exercise in democracy , which was a shame in their view . 
[PER BOUTEFLIKA  ] APPOINTS SENATORS OF HIS GENERATION --------------------------------------------- - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On the day of the election , eight new senators joined the [ORG Conseil de la Nation  ] as part of the third of the membership appointed directly by President [PER Bouteflika  ] ( ref A ) . 
All have one characteristic in common: they are " moudjahidine , " or veterans ( like [PER Bouteflika  ] ) of the war of independence against [LOC France  ] . 
According to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , these newly appointed senators , as members of the " revolutionary family " and in a sense " siblings of President [PER Bouteflika  ] , " will be very loyal to him . 
Some senators quietly expressed to her their frustration that the president did not reach out to members of the younger generation who will need to lead the country after [PER Bouteflika  ] and his generation pass from the scene . 
VACANT SEATS FOR DEPARTING MINISTERS ? ------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Bouteflika  ] appointed just eight senators out of the 24 allotted to him this year . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , a former senator from the presidential tier , told us [PER Bouteflika  ] made a conscious decision to leave 16 seats vacant for later appointment . 
While it may be true that [PER Bouteflika  ] had not yet made up his mind in some cases , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] thought it more likely that he wanted to keep some [ORG Senate  ] seats in reserve for ministers who are expected to be dismissed shortly from the cabinet . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said the number of vacant seats was a good indicator that a cabinet shuffle was coming soon. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) COMMENT: Even though [PER Bouteflika  ] 's illness is receding in the minds of the public ( thanks to television pictures of an active president ) , the widely respected [PER Bensalah  ] is considered able to manage the presidential succession process should [PER Bouteflika  ] not be able to finish his term . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] analysis of the vacant [ORG Senate  ] seats also strikes us as on the mark .
