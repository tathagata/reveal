( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees  ] ( [ORG UNHCR  ] ) and the [LOC United Kingdom  ] - current chair - convened a meeting of the Working Group on Resettlement ( [ORG WGR  ] ) at the [ORG Palais des Nations  ] in [LOC Geneva  ] February 24 - 25 . 
Representatives of 20 governments as well as [ORG UNHCR  ] headquarters and field office staff engaged in resettlement participated . 
The [LOC United States  ] was represented by [PER Terry Rusch  ] , [ORG PRM  ] Director of [ORG Refugee Admissions  ] in the [ORG Bureau of Population , Refugees and Migration , Department of State  ] ; [PER Jennifer Higgins  ] , Deputy Director of the [ORG Refugee Affairs Division  ] , [ORG USCIS  ] in the [ORG Department of Homeland Security  ] ; [PER Barbara Day  ] , [ORG PRM  ] 's Domestic Resettlement Chief ; and [PER Melissa Pitotti  ] of the [ORG Office of Refugee and Migration Affairs  ] at the [ORG U.S. Permanent Mission  ] in [LOC Geneva.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG UNHCR  ] updated the group on resettlement referrals/departures progress in 2008 when it submitted for consideration over 120,000 refugees to resettlement countries ( a 22 percent increase over 2007 . 
65,000 refugees referred by [ORG UNHCR  ] departed for resettlement countries in 2008 ) a 31 percent increase over 2007 . 
The most significant developments since [ORG UNHCR  ] distributed its Global Projected Resettlement Needs Document in June are: 1 ) in light of the security situation in [LOC Pakistan  ] , virtually no progress can be made in utilizing resettlement for the 171,000 [MISC Afghans  ] there identified as in need of resettlement ; and 2 ) [ORG UNHCR  ] has revised downward the 2009 resettlement need for [MISC Iraqis  ] from 86,000 to 60-65,000 . 
The global economic crisis is taking its toll both on [ORG UNHCR  ] 's ability to continue to increase referrals and resettlement countries ability to receive and integrate them . 
[LOC Iceland  ] and [LOC Ireland  ] have already had to put their programs on hold and other governments may need to reduce their intake. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) There was discussion of progress in responding to [ORG UNHCR  ] 's October " [MISC Flash Appeal  ] " to meet the resettlement needs of vulnerable [MISC Palestinians  ] from [LOC Iraq  ] currently residing in difficult circumstances in [PER Al Waleed  ] , [PER Al Tanf  ] and [PER Al Hol  ] camps . 
[ORG UNHCR  ] 's efforts to refer these [MISC Palestinians  ] have thus far resulted in referrals for about half of the original 2,300 to various resettlement countries but another 1,150 places are needed . 
For countries requiring in-person interviews , the pace of off-take will depend on the establishment of workable logistical arrangements . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] reported that various " platforms " are being explored to facilitate processing of the several hundred [MISC Palestinians  ] already referred to the [LOC U.S.  ] The recent opening of the [ORG Evacuation Transit Center  ] ( [ORG ETC  ] ) in [LOC Timisoara  ] , [LOC Romania  ] will allow the transfer of some of the most vulnerable [MISC Palestinian  ] cases in a matter of weeks . 
[ORG UNHCR  ] also reported that other governments have offered use of their territory for this purpose on an ad hoc basis. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The issue of the integration of resettled refugees continues to be of interest to many resettlement countries . 
Some include " integration potential " in their selection process . 
[ORG UNHCR  ] 's [ORG Agenda for Protection  ] " calls upon states to put in place policies to ensure that resettlement runs in tandem with a vigorous integration policy . 
Language training , education , vocational training , employment , support for family reunification ) these and many other activities are the building blocks of integration . 
And while resettlement is a way of protecting refugees and a tangible sign of responsibility-sharing by states , there is no doubt that refugees also make important contributions to their new societies . 
" A draft longitudinal survey document to measure resettlement outcomes was distributed and will be further discussed at the Annual [PER Tripartite Consultations  ] ( [ORG ATC  ] ) meeting in June . 
( In light of the fact that [ORG NGOs  ] often play a significant role in the integration process , a few [MISC NGO  ] representatives were included in the [ORG WGR  ] meeting which is normally limited to governments and [ORG UNHCR  ] . 
Many more [MISC NGO  ] representatives will participate in June . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG WGR  ] breakout sessions were devoted to topics including: the special challenges resettlement countries are encountering integrating [MISC Iraqis  ] ; best practices in the integration of vulnerable groups ; assisting refugees to find employment and contribute to the community ; and a discussion of improvements needed in " twinning " arrangements between established and emerging resettlement countries. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [LOC U.S.  ] hosted the five-country ( [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC Canada  ] , [LOC Australia  ] , [LOC New Zealand  ] , [LOC U.K  ] . 
) dinner on February 24 . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] reps briefed on current funding limitations for the [ORG UNHCR  ] Resettlement Initiative that would result in our requiring [ORG UNHCR  ] to meet [LOC U.S.  ] referrals targets for each funded location before resettlement referrals are made to other resettlement countries . 
This could result in a significant reduction in referrals to countries that do not fund [ORG UNHCR  ] 's referrals capacity . 
At the request of various overseas processing partners , the [LOC U.S.  ] also identified areas where delays in resettlement country decisions on medical cases are causing extreme hardship for refugees and the protracted delays in the off-take of approved cases is complicating refugee camp dynamics . 
We are providing case specific information to the countries in question. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The Annual [PER Tripartite Consultations  ] ( [ORG ATC  ] ) are scheduled for June 30 ) July 2 in [LOC Geneva  ] .
