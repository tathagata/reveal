REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: President [PER Rahmon  ] has fired a senior anti-narcotics officer who pressed for prosecution of a distant relative and Major from the [ORG State Committee for National Security  ] ( i.e. the [ORG KGB  ] ) who were arrested while transporting heroin in a government vehicle . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Post learned from a source in the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] that [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] President [PER Rahmon  ] personally fired [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] . 
This resulted from the intercept a week ago , by [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] police , of a [ORG State Security  ] vehicle in southern [LOC Tajikistan  ] carrying about 60 kilograms of heroin . 
The car was driven by [ORG State Security  ] officers , one of whom was a distant relative of President [PER Rahmon  ] . 
This was the third such detection and arrest of [ORG State Security  ] personnel moving narcotics in government vehicles in the past year . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] pressed for the prosecution of all of the officers involved , including the president’s relative . 
XXXXXXXXXXXX’s firing was allegedly the result of this effort . 
The Minister of [LOC Interior  ] reportedly met the president [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and pleaded for [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to keep his job , to no avail. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) This is the only case we know of where the president has intervened personally to remove a high-level official to protect his relatives from drugs-related prosecution . 
However , this is part of a pattern of high level intervention , sometimes using the president’s [ORG Anti-Corruption Commission  ] , to protect organized crime members involved in drugs , money laundering , and protection/extortion activities within [LOC Tajikistan.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] led the most effective counter narcotics organization in [LOC Tajikistan  ] . 
His police division seized several times as much heroin per year as the [ORG Drug Control Agency XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] had been in his position for the past decade , and had the reputation of a competent , relatively uncorrupt , and committed law enforcement officer . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Comment: [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] stepped on two land mines: repeatedly arresting [ORG State Security  ] officers who were working as drug couriers , and then going after a relative of the president . 
[ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] any committed officer who [ORG XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] wishes to pursue drug cases to a high level or close to the president , faces the same minefield . 
This incident emphasizes the vulnerability of senior officials to summary removal if they displease the president or touch his family interests . 
This in turn illustrates the need for our engagement on narcotics to be both broad and deep , and not heavily reliant on individuals who might disappear without warning . 
End Comment .
