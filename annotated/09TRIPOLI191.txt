REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: Consideration of a draft constitution was on the agenda for the recently-concluded session of the Basic People 's Congresses ( [ORG BPC  ] ) , but was apparently dropped out of concern that including it could undermine efforts to gain support for controversial wealth distribution and government re-structuring reforms proposed by [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi . 
Western [MISC Libyan  ] contacts were united in their concern that the hazily-formulated reforms could prompt economic problems and threaten the limited reform initiatives already underway ; however , xxxxxxxxxxxx told us that the majority of [LOC BPCs  ] in eastern [LOC Libya  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx had recommended that the [ORG General People 's Congress  ] adopt wealth distribution and government re-structuring . 
He argued that eastern [MISC Libyans  ] , frustrated by years of calculated neglect by the regime , believed they stood a better chance of getting a more equal share of oil revenues and having less corrupt government if they adopted al-Qadhafi 's proposed reforms . 
In addition , eastern [MISC Libyan  ] politicians and leaders viewed the reforms as a means by which to devolve resource allocation decisions and , to a limited extent , political authority away from the central government and toward provincial leaders , potentially facilitating their long-term goal of a return to the federal system of government that existed before the 1969 al-Fateh Revolution/coup . 
The fact that the majority of [LOC BPCs  ] in eastern [LOC Libya  ] , a region not known for its love of [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi or his regime , have reportedly supported al-Qadhafi 's proposals is best understood as a reflection of the extent of their frustration with the extant political system rather than an endorsement of the ideas themselves . 
End summary . 
CONSTITUTION DROPPED FROM AGENDA AMID CONCERNS ABOUT FOCUS ON OTHER PROPOSED REFORMS 2 . 
( C ) As reported ref A , [LOC Libya  ] 's 468 Basic People 's Congresses ( [LOC BPCs  ] ) convened February 18-23 to consider direct distribution of [LOC Libya  ] 's oil wealth to its citizens and government re-structuring that would involve dismantling most existing ministry-equivalents , proposals first posited by [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi last March ( ref B ) . xxxxxxxxxxxx said the preliminary draft agenda for the [MISC BPCs  ] included reviewing the draft constitution prepared by a committee under the auspices of [LOC Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , son of [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi , with the expectation that it would be put forward to the upcoming [ORG General People 's Congress  ] ( [ORG GPC  ] ) in early March for consideration and ( presumably ) ratification . 
In the end , the constitution was dropped from the [LOC BPCs  ] final agenda and was not/not considered . 
3 . 
( C ) xxxxxxxxxxxx said concerns at the [ORG General People 's Committee  ] level ( cabinet-equivalent ) about apparent opposition to the core issues of wealth distribution and government re-structuring prompted the decision to drop the constitution from the agenda . 
The regime 's concern was to ensure that [MISC BPCs  ] ultimately recommended to the [ORG General People 's Congress  ] that it adopt wealth distribution and government re-structuring ; given sensitivities about adopting a constitution ( [LOC Libya  ] currently does not have one ) , it was feared that considering that issue as well would dilute the [MISC BPCs  ] focus. xxxxxxxxxxxx said the constitution was on the [MISC BPCs'  ] agenda as recently as February 14 , when [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi hotly responded to dissent within the [ORG General People 's Committee  ] about the proposed reforms , urging [ORG BPC  ] members and regime officials to move ahead with wealth distribution and re-structuring . 
Criticizing the poor performance of the [ORG General People 's Committee  ] system xxxxxxxxxxxx characterized the changes as part of an effort to combat endemic corruption in and underperformance by the GPCs . 
It is unclear whether the constitution will be considered at the upcoming session of the [ORG General People 's Congress  ] . 
The constitution is reportedly being reviewed by the [ORG General Peoples Committee  ] and may be put forward by it to the [ORG General Peoples Congress  ] , possibly a workaround devised after it was removed from the [MISC BPCs'  ] agenda ( further details septel ) . 
MAJORITY OF EASTERN [MISC LIBYAN  ] BPCS ENDORSE AL-QADHAFI'S PROPOSED REFORMS .. . 
4 . 
( C ) With respect to wealth distribution and re-structuring , xxxxxxxxxxxx put forward the recommendation that both proposals be considered and adopted by the [ORG General People 's Congress.  ] xxxxxxxxxxxx Citing conversations on Feb 23-24 with secretaries of other [MISC BPCs  ] , he said it appeared that the majority of [MISC BPCs  ] in eastern [LOC Libya  ] had made similar recommendations . 
Wealth distribution , an idea that has sparked the imagination of many ordinary [MISC Libyans  ] , dominated most of the proceedings . 
Little attention was focused on the potentially more critical issue of government re-structuring . 
He conceded that his [MISC BPCs'  ] recommendations contained few specific details about how to successfully implement the initiatives . 
He said the [MISC Sha'abiyat  ] and [ORG General People 's Congress  ] were responsible for coming up with such ideas . 
( Comment: Given the performance of xxxxxxxxxxxx representatives in their meeting with the Ambassador on February 23 , this does not give cause for much hope . 
End comment . 
) .. . 
BUT FOR REASONS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH LOYALTY TO THE REGIME 5 . 
( C ) Acknowledging the lack of clarity about how wealth distribution and re-structuring would be implemented , xxxxxxxxxxxx stressed that his constituents were disappointed enough with the [LOC Jamahiriya  ] 's performance to give the relatively radical proposals a try . 
Eastern [LOC Libya  ] had suffered until very recently from a lack of investment and government resources , part of a campaign by the al-Qadhafi regime to keep the area poor and , theoretically , less likely to develop as a viable alternative locus of power to [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
Despite a recent surge in government projects in and around [LOC Benghazi  ] ( further details septel ) , eastern [MISC Libyans  ] had generally not benefited from limited economic reform to the extent that those in the western province of [LOC Tripolitania  ] had . 
6 . 
( C ) xxxxxxxxxxxx argued that eastern [MISC Libyans  ] calculated that they stood a better chance of getting a more equal share of oil revenues and having less corrupt government if they adopted al-Qadhafi 's proposed reforms . 
In addition , eastern [MISC Libyan  ] politicians and leaders viewed the reforms as a means by which to devolve resource allocation decisions and , to a limited extent , political authority away from the central government and toward provincial leaders. xxxxxxxxxxxx stated that a long-term goal of most eastern [MISC Libyans  ] was to effect a return to something akin to the federal system of government that existed before the 1969 al-Fateh Revolution/coup , in which the provinces enjoyed greater autonomy . 
The government re-structuring advocated by al-Qadhafi would theoretically entail dismantling the existing system of [ORG General People 's Committees  ] , potentially creating a vacuum into which provincial leaders could move . 
7 . 
( C ) Comment: As reported ref A and previous , the consensus among contacts in and around [LOC Tripoli  ] since al-Qadhafi first proposed wealth distribution and re-structuring last March was concern that the hazily-formulated scheme could prompt serious macro-economic distortions ( hyperinflation among them ) and that nascent reforms already underway would be hurt , jeopardizing the increased availability of consumer goods and other recent improvements in the standard of living for ordinary [MISC Libyans  ] . 
Of particular concern to western [MISC Libyans  ] was the proposal to scrap government support for education and health care . 
The Executive Director of the [ORG Qadhafi Development Foundation  ] said as recently as February 22 that the weight of opinion at the [ORG BPC  ] level appeared to be against supporting wealth distribution . 
The fact that the majority of [MISC BPCs  ] in eastern [LOC Libya  ] , a region not known for its love of [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi or his regime , have reportedly supported al-Qadhafi 's proposals is best understood as a reflection of the extent of their frustration with the extant political system rather than an endorsement of the ideas themselves . 
As such , it underscores the lack of cohesion and lingering mistrust between the three major regions that comprise modern [PER Libya: Tripolitania  ] ( western [LOC Libya  ] ) ; [LOC Cyrenaica  ] ( eastern [LOC Libya  ] ) ; and the [PER Fezzan  ] ( southern [LOC Libya  ] ) .
