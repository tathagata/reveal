( C ) SUMMARY . 
During a December 18 visit to [LOC Berlin  ] , the governors of [LOC Kunar  ] and [LOC Wardak  ] provinces pressed for greater [MISC German  ] assistance with the training and equipping of the [MISC Afghan  ] Border Police ( [ORG ABP  ] ) and the [ORG Afghan National Police  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) . 
In a surprise announcement , the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] revealed that [LOC Germany  ] planned to establish a new training academy for the [ORG ABP  ] in [LOC Kabul  ] that will train up to 500 border police officers at a time . 
While acknowledging ongoing security challenges , both governors strongly disputed claims that a majority of the country is controlled by the [ORG Taliban  ] . 
They argued that security trends are actually positive , and welcomed additional international troops to help prepare the ground for further advancements on development and governance . 
The governors also emphasized the need for the international community to focus its efforts at the district level and to eliminate discrepancies in development aid among provinces . 
The governors invited journalists during a press conference to come to [LOC Kunar  ] and [LOC Wardak  ] to see for themselves that the comprehensive approach is working . 
If [ORG Embassy Kabul  ] were willing , and funding for a visit by a group of ten to twelve [MISC German  ] journalists could be arranged , we would advocate taking them up on the offer . 
END SUMMARY . 
THE PROGRAM <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) Kunar Governor [PER Sayed Fazlullah Wahidi  ] and Wardak Governor [PER Halim Fedai  ] visited [LOC Berlin  ] December 18 , courtesy of a [LOC PA  ] program jointly sponsored by [ORG Embassy Kabul  ] and [ORG USNATO  ] , which took them first to [LOC Brussels  ] and then to [LOC Paris  ] . 
The two governors , together with their [ORG Embassy Kabul  ] escorts , flew on to [LOC Munich  ] after their stay in [LOC Berlin  ] for a further two days of meetings and events before departing back to [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( [LOC Munich  ] program to be reported septel ) . 
The governors had a full program in [LOC Berlin  ] , which included a roundtable with more than a dozen [MISC German  ] parliamentarians and separate meetings with the state secretaries at the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] ( [ORG MOI  ] ) and [ORG Foreign Office  ] ( [ORG MFA  ] ) . 
The governors also participated in a press conference featuring leading journalists from print and electronic media , whose questions focused on security , corruption and the state of development in [LOC Kunar  ] and [LOC Wardak  ] . 
Coverage so far in print media has been skeptical , but overall positive . 
At the end of the day , the governors came to the [ORG Embassy  ] for a wrap-up session with the Charge . 
CONTROLLING THE BORDER WITH [LOC PAKISTAN  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In all the meetings , Kunar Governor [PER Wahidi  ] emphasized [LOC Kunar  ] 's geographic position as an eastern province with a 240-kilometer border with [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
He complained that his province only had 600 of the 3,000 [MISC Afghan  ] Border Police ( [ORG ABP  ] ) needed to properly control this border and he appealed to his [MISC German  ] interlocutors to provide greater assistance with the training and equipping of the [ORG ABP  ] . 
[ORG MOI  ] State Secretary [PER August Hanning  ] agreed that having a fully functioning and effective border police force was decisive in achieving success in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and in a surprise announcement , revealed that [LOC Germany  ] was planning to establish a [ORG ABP  ] training academy in [LOC Kabul  ] , in an old [MISC Russian  ] building right next to the existing German-run [ORG Afghan National Police  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) academy. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) On the margins of the meeting , [ORG MOI  ] officials indicated that the academy would focus its work on training higher-level police officers in the [ORG ABP  ] and that the plan was to accommodate up to 500 students at time . 
They were not sure how long the course of instruction would last , indicating that this was still under consideration . 
They invited us to return in January to get a fuller picture of their plans for the academy. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) During the meeting with parliamentarians , [PER Elke Hoff  ] of the [ORG Free Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG FDP  ] ) , who is a regular visitor to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , said that while [LOC Pakistan  ] was ready to work with [LOC Afghanistan  ] in reinforcing and controlling their common border , [LOC Afghanistan  ] 's reluctance to accept the [ORG Durand Line  ] seemed to be hindering cooperation . 
[PER Wahidi  ] rejected the need for [LOC Afghanistan  ] to formally recognize the [ORG Durand Line  ] ( something he claimed that [LOC Afghanistan  ] was simply not in a position to deal with at the current time ) in order to enable effective control of the border with [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
He argued that since many tribes straddle both sides of the border , border control could not , in any event , consist of erecting barriers and checkpoints that limited the legitimate travel of tribal members back and forth between [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Instead , he called for an increased and permanent presence of [ORG ABP  ] on the border to deter , prevent and respond to the entry of insurgents from [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
EQUIPPING THE POLICE <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Wardak Governor [PER Fedai  ] also focused on the police in his remarks , stressing that the challenges went far beyond training . 
He noted that the [ORG Afghan National Police  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) lacked the necessary communication equipment to talk to each other , relying solely on personal cell phones , which frequently did not work at night . 
He said the [ORG Afghanistan National Development Strategy  ] ( [ORG ANDS  ] ) called for the construction of nine police stations in [LOC Wardak  ] , but these remained unfunded . 
He complained that the police throughout [LOC Afghanistan  ] lack uniforms , vehicles , fuel , accommodations , explosive ordnance disposal ( EOD ) equipment and the tools necessary to do forensic investigations . 
He agreed with [MISC German  ] parliamentarians who thought that police salaries had to be increased significantly to discourage corruption . 
But while he argued for a salary of $300 to 500 per month , [PER Wahidi  ] was more cautious , noting that police salaries were already on par with that of the [ORG Afghan National Army  ] ( [ORG ANA  ] ) . 
DISPUTING CLAIMS REGARDING SECURITY SITUATION <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Both governors disputed recent studies and reports that have concluded that more than 70 percent of the country is controlled by the [ORG Taliban  ] and other insurgent groups . 
They claimed that all of the districts in their respective provinces were in the hands of the government , although [PER Wahidi  ] acknowledged that parts of the mountainous border region of [LOC Kunar  ] were not always under full control due to the lack of sufficient border police . 
He also made the point that the frequency of attacks alone do not indicate that the [ORG Taliban  ] is strong -- in fact , suicide bombings are clearly a tactic of the weak. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The governors also criticized the media for giving the perception that the security situation in [LOC Wardak  ] and other [MISC RC-East  ] provinces continued to worsen over the past year . 
[PER Fedai  ] argued that while it was true that security had deteriorated in [LOC Wardak  ] in 2006 and 2007 , things had turned around in 2008 . 
He noted that while four of [LOC Wardak  ] 's nine districts had temporarily fallen under [ORG Taliban  ] control in 2007 , this had not happened at all in 2008 . 
There were no permanent bases for insurgents in [LOC Wardak  ] . 
He also criticized the media for failing to distinguish between insurgent and criminal activities , claiming that some 70 percent of the security incidents in [LOC Wardak  ] were criminally motivated and not ideological attacks against the government . 
WHY MORE TROOPS ARE NEEDED <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [LOC SBU  ] ) At the press conference , the governors were asked why they were asking for the deployment of additional foreign troops if , in fact , the [ORG Taliban  ] were getting weaker and the security situation was improving . 
The governors pointed out that the additional foreign troops were necessary to fill continuing security gaps until sufficient numbers of the [ORG ANA  ] , [ORG ANP  ] , [ORG ABP  ] and other [ORG Afghan National Security Forces  ] ( [ORG ANSF  ] ) were trained and equipped to do the job themselves . 
In response to a question about President-Elect [PER Obama  ] deciding to send additional [LOC U.S.  ] troops to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Wahidi  ] responded: He didn't decide to send them -- we asked for them ! 
[PER Wahidi  ] noted that these troops would help prepare the ground to enable further advances on development and governance. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) In the wrap-up session with the Charge , [MISC Afghan  ] Ambassador to [LOC Germany  ] Zulfacar reported that new [MISC Afghan  ] Interior Minister [PER Atmar  ] had made the same point to his [MISC German  ] counterpart the previous week during an introductory visit to [LOC Berlin  ] . 
[PER Atmar  ] had emphasized that there are currently not enough security forces to hold territory after it has been cleared , thereby allowing the [ORG Taliban  ] to come back in and negate the beneficial effect of the military operations . 
DISCREPANCIES IN DEVELOPMENT AID <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The governors highlighted the wide discrepancy in the distribution of development aid by [ORG PRT  ] lead nations , as exemplified in their own two provinces . 
[PER Wahidi  ] noted that the [LOC U.S.  ] had spent some $82 million for a wide variety of projects in [LOC Kunar  ] in the past year . 
[PER Fedai  ] said that the [MISC Turkish  ] [ORG PRT  ] in [LOC Wardak  ] , by comparison , had only spent a total of $15 million on projects in the province over the past three years , out of a total of $100 million for the whole country . 
He said that other international actors like the [ORG EU  ] were needed to provide supplementary resources in provinces where the [ORG PRT  ] was led by a relatively poorer country , like [LOC Turkey  ] . 
[ORG MFA State  ] Secretary [PER Reinhard Silberberg  ] said more should be done to get rich [MISC Islamic  ] countries like [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] and the [LOC Gulf  ] states , which are natural partners for [LOC Afghanistan  ] , more involved in supporting the development effort . 
He noted that while [LOC Germany  ] had pledged some $420 million over the next three years at the [ORG Paris Conference  ] this past summer , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] had committed just $20 million . 
EMPHASIS ON DISTRICT LEVEL <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Both governors emphasized the need for the international community to focus its efforts at the district level in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , noting that most [MISC Afghans  ] do not live in [LOC Kabul  ] or a provincial capital , but rather in small rural villages across the country . 
They praised [MISC CSTC-A  ] 's [ORG Focused District Development  ] ( [ORG FDD  ] ) police training and mentoring as an example of a program that correctly takes account of this reality . 
Both [ORG MFA State  ] Secretary [PER Silberberg  ] and [ORG MOI State  ] Secretary [PER Hanning  ] confirmed that they found the case for the [ORG FDD  ] program to be compelling , which was why [LOC Germany  ] planned to participate in [ORG FDD  ] on a bilateral basis in selected northern districts beginning in January. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Silberberg  ] also conceded that the [ORG EU Police Mission  ] ( [ORG EUPOL  ] ) -- which up until now has focused its work on the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] in [LOC Kabul  ] and on giving strategic advice on how to set up the [ORG ANP  ] and other [MISC Afghan  ] police forces -- should be reoriented to focus more attention on police training . 
He indicated that [LOC Germany  ] was pressing [ORG EUPOL  ] in this direction . 
[ORG Green Party Defense  ] Spokesman [PER Winfried Nachtwei  ] told us after the parliamentary meeting with the governors that his judgment about the irrelevance of [ORG EUPOL  ] had been confirmed by the fact that neither [PER Wahidi  ] nor [PER Fedai  ] knew anything about it and talked only about the success of [ORG FDD  ] . 
TAKING THE GOVERNORS UP ON THEIR INVITATION ? <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [LOC SBU  ] ) The governors invited journalists during the press conference to come to [LOC Kunar  ] and [LOC Wardak  ] to see for themselves that the comprehensive approach is working . 
This presents obvious logistical challenges , but if [ORG Embassy Kabul  ] were willing , and funding for a visit by a group of ten to twelve [MISC German  ] journalists could be arranged , we would advocate taking them up on the offer . 
While bringing [MISC Afghan  ] officials to [LOC Brussels  ] on a USNATO tour is certainly beneficial , we have found there is no replacement for sending [MISC German  ] journalists to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
It is relatively easy for journalists to visit [LOC Mazar  ] and [LOC Kunduz  ] through trips sponsored by the [MISC German  ] military , but we have seen the most effective coverage in [MISC German  ] media when reporters visit multiple provinces and PRTs outside the north . 
SIDE BENEFIT: MENTORING OUR [MISC AFGHAN  ] COLLEAGUES <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) This is the third time within the past year that we have had [MISC Afghan  ] governors stop in [LOC Berlin  ] as part of a USNATO/Embassy Kabul-sponsored tour to [LOC Brussels  ] . 
In addition to giving us an excellent opportunity to advance our [LOC Afghanistan  ] agenda , both in private meetings with high-ranking [MISC German  ] officials and through public diplomacy , these visits have also facilitated growing cooperation between [LOC Mission Germany  ] and the [MISC Afghan  ] [ORG Embassy  ] here in [LOC Berlin  ] . 
With each succeeding visit , the [MISC Afghans  ] take on more and more responsibility for planning the program and scheduling the appointments . 
We have successfully used these visits to mentor our [MISC Afghan  ] counterparts on organizing VIP visits and making contacts in the [MISC German  ] government and [ORG Bundestag  ] .
