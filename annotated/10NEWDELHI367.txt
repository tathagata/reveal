( S ) Summary: In a February 23 meeting , [ORG FBI  ] Director [PER Robert Mueller  ] told [MISC Indian  ] Home Affairs Minister [PER P.

[PER Chidambaram  ] requested direct access to [PER Headley  ] , even if such access produces no information , as well as access to [LOC Headley’s  ] spouse , who he said was in [LOC Chicago  ] . 
[PER Chidambaram  ] asked whether a [ORG GOI  ] official could monitor [LOC Headley’s  ] interrogation and submit questions “in real time.” [PER Chidambaram  ] said he had “a feeling in my bones that [PER Headley  ] was not acting here alone , ” but conceded that he had no evidence to support his supposition that [PER Headley  ] formed sleeper cells in [LOC India  ] , one of which may have been involved in the February 13 Pune bombing . 
[PER Mueller  ] assented to Chidambaram’s request for expedited [ORG FBI  ] lab assistance regarding forensic cyber and voice recognition analysis .

End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Director [PER Mueller  ] opened the 20-minute meeting by expressing satisfaction over increasingly close bilateral cooperation . 
Characterizing the information produced by interrogations of [PER David Headley  ] as among the most important intelligence the [ORG USG  ] has gleaned in the past 6 - 8 months , the Director assured [PER Chidambaram  ] that we would continue to pass such information in a timely manner to [LOC India  ] . 
Noting that the process of [LOC Headley’s  ] proffer of evidence is nearing a critical stage , [PER Mueller  ] observed that [PER Headley  ] has expressed hatred toward [LOC India  ] and may “clam up” if his guilty plea is tied in any way to cooperation with the [LOC GOI.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) After thanking [PER Mueller  ] for the “outstanding cooperation” displayed by the [ORG USG  ] , [PER Chidambaram  ] stated that he understood from his discussions with Attorney General Holder that the [ORG GOI  ] cannot use any information provided by the [ORG USG  ] at this time in [MISC Indian  ] prosecutions . 
He noted , however , that [ORG GOI  ] investigators had developed information on their own through examination of [LOC Headley’s  ] computer and emails . 
[PER Chidambaram  ] insisted that the [ORG GOI  ] have access to [LOC Headley:  ] “we must be able to say we had access , even if [PER Headley  ] did not speak.” He also requested access to [LOC Headley’s  ] spouse , [PER Shaiza  ] , who he said is in [LOC Chicago  ] so [ORG GOI  ] investigators can question her on the meaning of her alleged message to [PER Headley  ] that she “saw your graduation.” Director [PER Mueller  ] said he would look into both requests . 
In reply to Chidambaram’s observation that the “worst outcome would be a light sentence of 2 or 3 years for [PER Headley  ] , ” [PER Mueller  ] stated that [PER Headley  ] is looking at a considerably longer sentence. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER Chidambaram  ] informed [PER Mueller  ] that the [ORG GOI  ] would soon send a number of Letters Rogatory to the [ORG USG  ] in relation to the [PER Headley  ] case , and [PER Mueller  ] responded that we would welcome such documents . 
Returning to the issue of access to [PER Headley  ] , [PER Chidambaram  ] asked whether [ORG GOI  ] personnel could monitor and pass questions “in real time” to [ORG USG  ] personnel conducting [LOC Headley’s  ] interrogation . 
[PER Mueller  ] replied that he would look into this possibility . 
[PER Chidambaram  ] again thanked the [ORG USG  ] for providing information and assistance , but asked whether [ORG GOI  ] requests could be handled more promptly . 
The Home Minister asked for increased cooperation in three areas: 1 ) cybser security ; 2 ) forensic cooperation ; and 3 ) some financial initiatives and cooperation. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) [PER Chidambaram  ] confided that “I have a feeling in my bones that [PER Headley  ] was not acting alone” in [LOC India  ] and expressed frustration over what he characterized as [LOC Headley’s  ] false claim that he had no accomplices in [LOC India  ] . 
The Home Affairs Minister conceded he had no evidence to support his working hypothesis that [PER Headley  ] formed sleeper cells in [LOC India  ] , one of which may have perpetrated the February 13 Pune bombing . 
He noted that the [ORG GOI  ] would not file formal charges against [PER Headley  ] until the trial of [LOC Mumbai  ] defendant [PER Mir Kasab  ] is finished for fear that [PER Kasab  ] would use the [PER Headley  ] charges as a way to delay conclusion of his own trial . 
[PER Chidambaram  ] complained that [LOC Pakistan  ] had “done damn near nothing” to prosecute Mumbai-related terror suspects , but added that the [ORG GOI  ] would present a list of terror suspects to [MISC Pakistani  ] officials when the two sides meet for talks in New [LOC Delhi  ] on February 25 . 
[PER Mueller  ] said he was traveling to [LOC Pakistan  ] and would press the [MISC Pakistanis  ] for increased cooperation .
