End Summary. - - [ORG LRA  ] - - <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Africa Bureau Assistant  ] Secretary [PER Jendayi Frazer  ] traveled to [LOC Uganda  ] on September 5 and met with President [PER Yoweri Museveni  ] and northern [MISC Ugandan  ] officials . 
She was accompanied by Ambassador [PER Browning  ] , [ORG Senior Advisor for Conflict Resolution  ] [PER Tim Shortley  ] , and the P/E Chief ( notetaker ) . 
[PER A/S Frazer  ] opened the meeting by introducing [PER Tim Shortley  ] as her new [ORG Senior Advisor on Conflict Resolution  ] who will focus on [ORG LRA  ] and eastern [LOC Congo  ] . 
She then asked President [PER Museveni  ] for his views on the status of the negotiations with the [ORG LRA  ] . 
[PER Museveni  ] expressed pessimism about the peace process , describing it as a &circus8 and that the [ORG LRA  ] was being &pampered.8 President [PER Museveni  ] told [PER Frazer  ] that he had discussed the process with [ORG U.N.  ] Special Envoy for LRA-Affected Areas [PER Joachim Chissano  ] during [PER Chissano’s  ] recent visit to [ORG Kampala  ] . 
He agreed with [PER Chissano  ] to give the peace talks until the end of January unless there were signs of &irreversible progress.8 [PER Museveni  ] said he would raise the [ORG LRA  ] in his meeting with [MISC Congolese  ] President [PER Joseph Kabila  ] in [LOC Arusha  ] on September 8 . 
[PER Museveni  ] said he would urge [PER Kabila  ] to take action now against the [ORG LRA  ] . 
He would advise [PER Kabila  ] to push the [ORG LRA  ] out of [LOC Congo  ] and into the assembly area in southern [LOC Sudan  ] to stop the [ORG LRA  ] from &gallivanting around [MISC Garamba.8 This  ] type of action could demonstrate [PER Kabila  ] , s commitment to enforcing the Cessation of [MISC Hostilities Agreement  ] , other regional pacts , and international resolutions. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Museveni  ] complained that the [ORG LRA  ] was using the peace talks to reorganize and described [PER Joseph Kony  ] as a &trickster.8 In [PER Museveni  ] , s view , the [ORG LRA  ] , s complaints that the [ORG International Criminal Court  ] ( [ORG ICC  ] ) warrants should be dropped prior to his coming out of the bush were not valid if a national legal process was underway to deal with the issue of accountability . 
The [ORG ICC  ] was only a problem for [PER Kony  ] if he did not want peace . 
[PER Museveni  ] was adamant that [PER Kony  ] should not be rewarded with a suspension or dropping of the [ORG ICC  ] indictments before he agreed to peace . 
Guarantees could be built into the implementation of a peace agreement to address his fears. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [ORG Senior Advisor Shortley  ] asked [PER Museveni  ] for his views on how [PER Kony  ] would be handled if he agreed to a deal . 
[PER Museveni  ] described his provision of protection , livelihood , and homes for [PER Kony  ] , s mother ( and now deceased father ) since 1994 . 
[PER Museveni  ] was flexible on [PER Kony  ] , s future , saying that the [ORG LRA  ] leader could live anywhere in [LOC Uganda  ] where he had not committed atrocities . 
[PER Museveni  ] agreed with [PER Shortley  ] that the resumption of the peace process could slip into October , which reaffirmed the President , s cynicism about the negotiations . 
Despite his misgivings about the &circus at [LOC Juba  ] , 8 [PER Museveni  ] was willing to allow the process to continue until the end of January. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Museveni  ] dismissed the demands for political power by the diaspora that backed the [ORG LRA  ] . 
He argued that northern [MISC Ugandans  ] were represented at all levels of government . 
In fact , [PER Museveni  ] pointed out that northerners elected opposition party members to represent them . 
The [MISC Ugandan  ] Government would not accept &rewarding8 the disaffected diaspora and &terrorists8 through the peace process . 
[PER Museveni  ] argued that if regime critics such as former [ORG U.N.  ] Special Representative for Children in Armed Conflict [PER Olara Otunnu  ] wanted to return to [LOC Uganda  ] to run for office , they could do so . 
If northern [LOC Uganda  ] was &thirsty8 to have [PER Otunnu  ] represent it , then a member of Parliament should vacate his seat for [PER Otunnu  ] to compete . 
He elaborated with the example of former President [PER Tito Okello  ] , s son , [PER Henry KAMPALA  ] 00001449 002 OF 004 [PER Okello Oryem  ] , who won election to parliament in [LOC Kitgum  ] . 
After he lost his parliamentary seat , [PER Museveni  ] appointed [PER Oryem  ] as Minister of State for [ORG International Relations  ] . 
( Note: [PER Oryem  ] is the deputy leader of the [ORG GOU  ] negotiating team . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The President also stated his belief that [PER Kony  ] was a proxy of the [ORG Khartoum Government  ] . 
[PER Museveni  ] proudly pointed out that [LOC Uganda  ] had defeated [LOC Khartoum  ] through its support for the [ORG Sudan Peoples  ] , [ORG Liberation Army  ] ( [ORG SPLA  ] ) even though , he joked , the [LOC United States  ] took credit for finalizing the [MISC Comprehensive Peace Agreement  ] ( [ORG CPA  ] ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Shortley  ] expressed the [ORG U.S. Government  ] , s hope that with increasing stability in northern [LOC Uganda  ] , the Peace , Recovery , and [ORG Development Plan  ] ( [ORG PRDP  ] ) could be formally launched in order to attract more attention from potential donors . 
[PER Museveni  ] said he wanted to correct the common misconception that peace in the north was the result of the negotiations . 
According to [PER Museveni  ] , the current stability was not the result of the peace talks but from [PER Kony  ] being pushed into [LOC Congo  ] . 
He said that the [ORG GOU  ] had defeated the [ORG LRA  ] in northern [LOC Uganda  ] and [LOC Southern Sudan  ] . 
For [PER Kony  ] , the peace process was a &relief8 from military pressure , according to the President . 
He also stated that there were many prominent [MISC Ugandans  ] who were [ORG LRA  ] collaborators who feared exposure and now viewed the peace talks as a way to save [PER Kony  ] and themselves. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER A/S Frazer  ] agreed with [PER Museveni  ] , s assessment of the [ORG LRA  ] , s intentions and the need to secure [PER Kabila  ] , s cooperation . 
She said it was encouraging that [PER Museveni  ] was meeting with [PER Kabila  ] . 
She told [PER Museveni  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] wanted to work together on potential contingenices , and in particular , help [LOC Uganda  ] transform the situation on the ground . 
Meeting the needs of the [ORG PRDP  ] would be an extremely important way of supporting this transformation . 
[PER Museveni  ] said the cabinet had prepared a paper on the [ORG PRDP  ] , which included a 14-point plan , with projects for industrializing northern [LOC Uganda.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Museveni  ] stated that &behind all of this is [LOC Sudan  ] , [LOC Sudan  ] , [LOC Sudan  ] , Sudan.8 He said that even if the [ORG Khartoum Government  ] could not supply the [ORG LRA  ] at previous levels , he believed it was in constant touch with the [ORG LRA  ] and smuggling supplies . 
[PER Museveni  ] said that the [LOC Uganda  ] military was now more capable to address the [ORG LRA  ] problem . 
[PER A/S Frazer  ] asked if [PER Museveni  ] had communicated his timeframe for the peace talks with the [ORG LRA  ] . 
[PER Museveni  ] said no , but [PER Chissano  ] may have , although he was not sure . 
[PER Museveni  ] downplayed the role of local politicians in the process . 
He described his own Government , s parallel track as part of the foolery and lamented that fools have a lot of audiences . 
He pointed out that even international conservation groups have contacted the [ORG LRA  ] to check on the white rhinos and other wildlife in the park . 
[PER Museveni  ] said that he himself participated in the “foolery” and has taken [PER Vincent Otti  ] , s telephone calls and sent the [ORG LRA  ] cows for [MISC Christmas  ] . 
The President claimed that the [ORG GOU  ] had infiltrated the [ORG LRA  ] and knew what its members were talking about. - - - - - - - EASTERN [LOC CONGO  ] - - - - - - - <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER A/S Frazer  ] asked [PER Museveni  ] if he could confirm media reports that [PER Kabila  ] had used gunships in eastern [LOC Congo  ] . 
[PER Museveni  ] did not know but would check . 
She also described [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to calm both [PER Kabila  ] and [MISC Rwandan  ] President [PER Kagame  ] , promote improved diplomatic relations , and foster inter-communal dialogue . 
[PER A/S Frazer  ] also highlighted [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to facilitate dialogue through the [ORG Tripartite Plus  ] process . 
[PER Museveni  ] said that Foreign Minister [PER Kutesa  ] had delivered several messages to [PER Kabila  ] . 
Kustesa was surprised that [PER Kabila  ] had taken the problem of the negative forces in eastern [LOC Congo  ] casually . 
[PER Museveni  ] said that [LOC Uganda  ] was begging [PER Kabila  ] to do something about [PER Kony  ] , the [ORG Allied Democratic Forces  ] , and the [ORG FDLR  ] . 
[LOC Uganda  ] made the argument that it is a state obligation for [LOC Congo  ] to take action , not a situation in which [PER Kabila  ] would be doing [PER Museveni  ] a favor . 
[PER Museveni  ] lamented that there was little to show on the security front since [ORG MONUC  ] , s inception . 
He attributed this to lack of attention by the five permanent members of the [ORG U.N. Security Council  ] and [ORG MONUC  ] , s current leadership . 
[PER Kabila  ] feels he has the protection of the &big boys8 , according to [PER Museveni  ] . 
However , [PER Museveni  ] said that the [ORG UNSC  ] was a better venue for addressing the problem than the [ORG U.N. General Assembly  ] . 
He gave the example of [LOC Ghana  ] , which had previously held strong positions on the [ORG LRA  ] , [LOC Congo  ] , and [LOC Sudan  ] , and now had weakened its stance after becoming chair of the [ORG African Union  ] . 
[ORG KAMPALA  ] 00001449 003 OF 004 <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Museveni  ] sees two ways in which [LOC Congo  ] could solve the [ORG LRA  ] problem . 
First , allow joint operations with [LOC Uganda  ] . 
Second , [LOC Congo  ] could find a third party , such as [LOC France  ] or [LOC Angola  ] to help . 
[PER Museveni  ] was flexible on how it was done and wanted [LOC Congo  ] to understand that it had a number of options . 
For [LOC Uganda  ] , it would be preferable if the [ORG U.N.  ] cleared the border areas of negative forces , which would then move deeper into [LOC Congo  ] . 
Re-establishing border control would lessen the threat of the negative forces to [LOC Uganda  ] and [LOC Rwanda  ] . 
In [LOC Museveni’s  ] view , once the negative forces moved deeper into [LOC Congo  ] , then [PER Kabila  ] could take as long as he wanted to deal with them. - - - - [LOC SOMALIA  ] - - - - <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) On [LOC Somalia  ] , [PER Museveni  ] raised concerns about [ORG Transitional Federal Government  ] President [PER Yusuf  ] , s non-inclusivity and the slowness in the building of a national army . 
He emphasized the importance of establishing a timetable for elections . 
[PER Museveni  ] felt that the [MISC Ugandan  ] military had a good relationship with [MISC Somali  ] civilians . 
Improvement of the infrastructure and economy were also essential to stabilizing the country . 
[LOC Uganda  ] had named an ambassador to [LOC Somalia  ] with 36 years of experience and who was an economist . 
[PER Museveni  ] asked him to prepare a paper on formalizing [LOC Somalia  ] , s informal economy. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Another problem in [LOC Somalia  ] was [LOC Eritrea  ] , according to [PER Museveni  ] . 
He described his visit with President [PER Isaias Aforkwi  ] in March and said that although the two promised to talk , they had not communicated since . 
[PER Museveni  ] said President [PER Isaias  ] was preoccupied with trying to unseat [PER Meles  ] . 
That was all [PER Isaias  ] talked about , yet [PER Museveni  ] observed that [PER Meles  ] did not appear to be in any less control of [LOC Ethiopia  ] despite [PER Isaias  ] , actions . 
[PER Museveni  ] told [PER A/S Frazer  ] that [PER Isaias  ] needed to be talked to by the members of the [ORG U.N. Security Council  ] who carry a big stick . 
[PER Museveni  ] claimed that [LOC Eritrea  ] continued to infiltrate weapons into [LOC Somalia  ] and said that [PER Isaias  ] needed to be intimidated . 
[PER Museveni  ] argued that the [ORG UNSC  ] should consider a blockade or sanctions if [LOC Eritrea  ] does not listen . 
If [PER Isaias  ] was controlled and [MISC Somali  ] groups cut off from him , the situation could stabilize . 
[PER A/S Frazer  ] told [PER Museveni  ] that the [LOC U.S.  ] was considering options , ranging from designation as harboring terrorists to drying up financial support , against [LOC Eritrea  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] was trying to persuade the [MISC Somali  ] parliamentarians in [LOC Eritrea  ] to leave before they associated with terrorist elements who sought refuge there . 
This would be important to establishing credentials as a legitimate opposition . 
She asked if [LOC Uganda  ] would be willing to accept those parliamentarians that chose to leave [LOC Eritrea  ] . 
[PER Museveni  ] agreed and explained that the wife of former warlord Aideed was still living in [LOC Uganda  ] . 
[PER Museveni  ] , s only condition was that TFG President [PER Yusuf  ] must have no objection . 
[PER A/S Frazer  ] said that any such arrangement would be worked on in consultation with key players in the political process. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - [ORG AFRICAN UNION  ] AND OTHER ISSUES - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Museveni  ] turned to his opposition to the formation of an “African Government.” He said that [LOC Libya  ] pushed hard for support for it at the summit , but that [LOC Uganda  ] led the charge against it . 
[PER Museveni  ] believes economic integration would be possible , but political integration would be difficult as each country has different foreign and internal policies and national identities . 
[LOC Uganda  ] also has a basic disagreement with [LOC Libya  ] over [LOC Sudan  ] . 
[PER Museveni  ] accused [LOC Libya  ] of pushing an [MISC Arab  ] agenda on the continent. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( S ) In a tte--tte with [PER A/S Frazer  ] , [PER Museveni  ] went further to express concern about [LOC Libya  ] , s intentions and methods of influencing &weak8 [MISC West African  ] states . 
[PER Museveni  ] said [PER Qadhafi  ] is trying to buy them off or intimidate them by destabilizing their countries unless they agree with union . 
He also expressed disappointment that President [PER Mbeki  ] has not effectively offered an alternative vision to [PER Qadhafi  ] , s approach to union government . 
[PER Museveni  ] said he and [PER Mbeki  ] are working together to counter [LOC Libya  ] , s vision of unity. - - - - - COMMENT - - - - - <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) [PER Museveni  ] demonstrated flexibility on how [ORG LRA  ] leader [PER Joseph Kony  ] might be handled . 
Though pessimistic about [ORG KAMPALA  ] 00001449 004 OF 004 whether the peace talks would succeed , [PER Museveni  ] was willing to let the peace process move forward , but not without end . 
He welcomed the addition of [ORG Senior Advisor Shortley  ] to support [LOC U.S.  ] efforts . 
Press coverage of [PER A/S Frazer’s  ] visit was extensive. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( U ) [PER A/S Frazer  ] cleared this message .
