Brownfield  ] , Ambassador ; REASON: 1.4 ( B ) , ( D ) SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C/NF ) [MISC Colombian  ] officials and observers are increasingly concerned about the long-term threat [LOC Venezuela  ] poses to their country . 
Experts inside and outside the government worry that any small incident along the tense border could spark a costly confrontation , given the decrease in communication and increase in tension between the two countries . 
Most believe the main risk comes from an unintentional incident , although influential [ORG GOC  ] advisors claim to be equally worried that President [PER Chavez  ] could start a war to distract [MISC Venezuelans  ] from their economic woes . 
Still , most of our interlocutors perceive a broader threat that transcends the current crisis -- they believe [LOC Venezuela  ] has isolated [LOC Colombia  ] , that its arms purchases will allow it to defeat [LOC Colombia  ] militarily , and that [MISC Venezuelan  ] trade restrictions will cause significant economic damage . 
Real or not , the perception of the threat posed by [LOC Venezuela  ] has widespread implications for [MISC Colombian  ] society . 
The perception that the USG is not supporting [LOC Colombia  ] is becoming an issue in public commentary and private conversation . 
End Summary . 
NEAR-TERM WORRIES: BORDER FLARE-UP , CHAVEZ'S UNPREDICTABILITY ----------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C/NF ) Few in [LOC Colombia  ] assess that [MISC Venezuelan  ] President [PER Chavez  ] plans a full-scale attack on [MISC Colombian  ] territory , but officials and commentators alike see a much greater risk that the heightened tension and increased [MISC Venezuelan  ] military presence along the border could spark an unintentional armed border conflict . 
Top [PER Uribe  ] security advisor [PER Paola Holguin  ] told us that even though it was clear the [ORG GBRV  ] could not move 15,000 troops to the border as announced ( ref A ) , she worried that what she called the " poorly trained and undisciplined " state of [MISC Venezuelan  ] troops could cause them to open fire without provocation . 
An analysis in leading newsweekly " [MISC Cambio  ] " pointed out that the lack of communication between the two countries -- along with the atmosphere of mutual recrimination and doubt -- could cause such an incident to spiral out of control . 
The analysis concluded that although war is not imminent , it is much closer now than during any previous bilateral crisis. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) These concerns are multiplied by what many here see as [LOC Venezuela  ] 's unpredictability . 
[ORG Presidential Communications  ] Director [PER Jorge Mario Eastman  ] told us this volatility made it particularly difficult toQredict the [MISC Venezuelan  ] leader 's reactions in crises like the current one . 
Similarly , [PER Carlos Morales  ] , [ORG MFA  ] Acting Director for [LOC Latin America  ] and the [LOC Caribbean  ] , expressed frustration over the difficulties his ministry had experienced in trying to predict the [ORG GBRV  ] 's decision-making . 
[PER Holguin  ] cautioned us that " a dictator like [PER Chavez  ] " calculates risk and reward differently from that of democratic governments like the USG and [ORG GOC  ] --making his moves hard to foresee . 
[MISC Colombian  ] media frequently portray [PER Chavez  ] as mercurial or even clownish , but our [ORG GOC  ] interlocutors believe he is quite rational -- just not predictable. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) Still , [PER Holguin  ] told us she and other [LOC Casa de Narino  ] insiders worry about a full-on [MISC Venezuelan  ] invasion , even though the current conventional wisdom predicts otherwise . 
She argued [PER Chavez  ] was desperate to distract his people from [LOC Venezuela  ] 's economic crisis , likening the situation to [LOC Argentina  ] 's 1982 seizure of the [LOC Falklands/Malvinas Islands  ] from the [LOC United Kingdom  ] . 
[PER Holguin  ] contended the [ORG GBRV  ] had killed the nine [MISC Colombians  ] , one [MISC Peruvian  ] , and one [MISC Venezuelan  ] whose bodies were discovered on October 24 in the [MISC Venezuelan  ] border state of [LOC Tachira  ] ( ref B ) and argued the act proved the [MISC Venezuelan  ] regime 's ruthlessness in attempting to provoke a war with [LOC Colombia.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) Virtually all local observers assess [LOC Colombia  ] would dominate [LOC Venezuela  ] in any armed conflict , as its years of experience and better-trained personnel would outweigh any [MISC Venezuelan  ] hardware edge gained from its recent spree of arms purchases . 
Nevertheless , many worry about the havoc [LOC Venezuela  ] could inflict in even a short conflict . 
General [PER Gustavo Matamoros  ] , commander of the [MISC Colombian  ] military 's [ORG Joint Caribbean Command  ] ( which includes long stretches of border territory in the northeast ) , told us earlier in the year that [MISC Colombian  ] armed forces in the area are far superior to those of the [ORG GBRV  ] , but conceded that the [ORG GBRV  ] could inflict unacceptable physical and political damage in border areas before being defeated rapidly . 
Similarly , [PER Eastman  ] noted that given the relatively short distances involved , a single [MISC Venezuelan  ] bomber could easily drop a bomb on a major [MISC Colombian  ] city -- an outcome the [ORG GOC  ] could not tolerate . 
[PER Holguin  ] argues that [PER Chavez  ] -- whom she called " a soldier who has never fought a battle " -- simply does not understand these human costs of combat the way that [MISC Colombians  ] do , or else he would not risk it . 
LONGER TERM WORRIES: REGIONAL ISOLATION , MILITARY IMBALANCE , ECONOMIC DECLINE ---------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S/NF ) Beyond the current crisis , we hear similar perceptions about the broader threat [LOC Venezuela  ] poses to [LOC Colombia  ] . 
First , officials and observers alike worry [PER Chavez  ] 's regional diplomacy ( fueled in equal measures by oil and ideology ) has left the [ORG GOC  ] alone in the region and surrounded by unfriendly countries . 
The [ORG MFA  ] 's [PER Morales  ] told us of [ORG GOC  ] concern that this has left [LOC Colombia  ] isolated , with few regional powers willing to speak out against [PER Chavez  ] 's aggressive rhetoric . 
[PER Holguin  ] said the region 's current silence only emboldened [PER Chavez  ] to continue to speak and act aggressively -- and to keep generating crises . 
Although she credited the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Senate  ] 's November 11 vote to delay [MISC Venezuelan  ] entry into Mercosur with [PER Chavez  ] 's newly-toned down rhetoric , she hoped other countries would be more willing to stand up and actively denounce [PER Chavez  ] . 
Professor [PER Sandra Borda  ] of the [MISC Universidad  ] de los [LOC Andes  ] , an international affairs specialist and member of the [ORG GOC  ] 's Mission on Foreign Policy , told us that President [PER Uribe  ] had told a recent Mission meeting that he believed this was a deliberate [ORG GBRV  ] strategy aimed at spreading [MISC Bolivarianism  ] and isolating [LOC Colombia  ] as one of the few remaining opponents of the ideology. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) Second , [ORG GOC  ] officials in particular are worried about [PER Chavez  ] 's recent arms acquisitions from [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , and other countries outside the hemisphere . 
[PER Morales  ] told us the hardware increasingly allowed the [ORG GBRV  ] to back up its hostile rhetoric , while [PER Holguin  ] conceded that the improved weaponry would eventually overwhelm the [ORG GOC  ] 's current advantages . 
This is creating political pressure on the [ORG GOC  ] to respond in kind . 
According to local press , the lower [ORG House of Congress  ] will hold hearings in early December to determine whether the [ORG GOC  ] is adequately prepared to face the [MISC Venezuelan  ] threat , while [ORG U Party Senator  ] [PER Juan Carlos Velez  ] publicly insisted the [ORG GOC  ] needed to purchase upgraded air defense systems to counter the [MISC Venezuelan  ] threat . 
Minister of Defense [PER Gabriel Silva  ] told the Ambassador the [ORG GOC  ] was also interested in discussing the acquisition of anti-tank systems . 
Professor [PER Borda  ] noted this dynamic could spread into a dangerous bilateral arms race , given that neither country finds credible the other side 's claims to be focusing on defensive capabilities. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) Finally , [MISC Colombians  ] worry about short- and medium-term damage to their economy caused by sharply decreased trade with their number-two trade partner . 
September exports to [LOC Venezuela  ] dropped by 52% , compared with September 2008 numbers . 
For the first half of October , [MISC Colombian  ] exports were down 77% compared to the same period in 2008 . 
[MISC Colombian  ] imports from [LOC Venezuela  ] are down 56% for the first nine months of 2009 . 
Given the high degree of interdependence in border areas , such as [LOC Cucuta  ] , trade restrictions and temporary border closings take a tremendous toll on the border region , and the [ORG GBRV  ] has taken other punitive steps that will continue to drive down trade ( ref C ) . 
Paradoxically , many in the [ORG GOC  ] and [MISC Colombian  ] business community see potential long-term benefits for [LOC Colombia  ] in the drop off in bilateral trade , as it will put greater pressure on [MISC Colombian  ] exporters to diversify their markets. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) [PER Alfredo Ramos  ] , Director of Economic Integration at the [ORG Ministry of Trade  ] , described the two countries as natural trading partners , noting that neither can readily replace the other . 
Nonetheless , he said it was entirely possible that [PER Chavez  ] could drive bilateral trade down to virtually zero in the coming months , suggesting continued downward pressure on [MISC Colombian  ] economic growth against a backdrop of increasing unemployment and stagnant economic activity . 
In a letter to President [PER Obama  ] dated October 29 , 2009 , President [PER Uribe  ] presented this same argument as a reason to push forward on the [ORG U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement  ] . 
[ORG USG  ] BECOMING AN ISSUE ? ---------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) On November 17 , Foreign Minister [PER Bermudez  ] summoned the Ambassador to express concern about the [ORG USG  ] position in the dispute with [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
He suggested that helpful neutrality was not the position the [ORG GOC  ] was hoping for , and predicted [PER Uribe  ] would drive this point home in the upcoming visit by Deputy Secretary [PER Steinberg  ] . 
Perhaps not coincidentally , the lead editorial in leading [MISC Colombian  ] paper " [ORG El Tiempo  ] " on November 20 focused on the issue of [ORG USG  ] neutrality . 
COMMENT: LEGITIMATE CONCERN OR PARANOIA ? ---------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C/NF ) We can argue the extent to which [MISC Colombians  ] have a legitimate reason for concern or are simply paranoid . 
The point , however , is that worry about [LOC Venezuela  ] abounds in [MISC Colombian  ] society . 
It affects politics , diplomacy , the economy , and , increasingly , military doctrine . 
We are confident that [MISC Colombian  ] leadership will maintain calm in its immediate dealings with [LOC Caracas  ] , but there will be increasing pressure to demonstrate that [LOC Colombia  ] is prepared to deal with its volatile neighbor to the east .
