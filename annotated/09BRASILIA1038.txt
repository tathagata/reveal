Reason: 1.4 <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) SUMMARY . 
[ORG NSC  ] WMD Coordinator [PER Gary Samore  ] visited [LOC Brasilia  ] August 6-7 to hold discussions with senior [MISC Brazilian  ] officials on [LOC North Korea  ] , [LOC Iran  ] and strengthening international nonproliferation and disarmament efforts . 
[PER Samore  ] approached the [MISC Brazilians  ] as potential partners in nonproliferation efforts , pointing out that [LOC Brazil  ] 's decision to forego its own nuclear weapons option and concentrate on peaceful uses of nuclear energy gave it high credibility as a counter example to [LOC Iran  ] . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] interlocutors were receptive to [PER Samore  ] 's message and believed that President [PER Obama  ] 's [LOC Prague  ] speech was important and opened the way for further dialogue ; however , they preferred to focus on the importnace of nuclear weapons states ( [ORG NWS  ] ) disarming rather than engage on nonproliferation . 
The [ORG GOB  ] responded positively to proposals for a nuclear security summit and for consultations on the 2010 NPT revcon . 
Presidential Foreign Policy Advisor [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] sounded a hopeful note by saying that the [ORG Administration  ] 's approach to disarmament would be helpful to [LOC Brazil  ] in addressing the question of signing an Additional Protocol ( [ORG AP  ] ) with the [ORG IAEA  ] and that he thought a solution could be reached . 
Prof. [PER Garcia  ] agreed to [PER Samore  ] 's proposal that a [LOC U.S.  ] team of experts would visit [LOC Brazil  ] to discuss implementation of the Additional Protocol . 
The visit provided important clarification of the roles of various [ORG GOB  ] agencies on nonproliferation issues . 
Although there was no indication that [LOC Brazil  ] is prepared immediately to play a more positive role on key nonproliferation issues , [PER Samore  ] 's visit opened the way to a more robust dialogue that would be important to eventually encouraging [LOC Brazil  ] to adopt a more constructive approach . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Samore  ] 's discussions included meetings with the [ORG Ministries of External Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) and Defense ( [ORG MOD  ] ) , the Presidency and the [ORG Office for Institutional Security  ] , newly designated to oversee security at nuclear installations . 
His meetings on nuclear energy will be reported septel . 
While responsibilities for energy are relatively clear cut , [LOC Brazil  ] is still developing its nuclear policy formulation process with the [ORG MRE  ] Under Secretary for Political Affairs playing a coordinating role . 
[PER Samore  ] 's meeting at the [ORG MOD  ] confirmed that protecting [LOC Brazil  ] 's enrichment program from greater oversight will remain a component of [MISC Brazilian  ] policy . 
All [ORG GOB  ] agencies , however , welcomed the opportunity for further dialogue with [ORG USG  ] counterparts . 
[LOC North Korea  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Samore  ] raised [LOC North Korea  ] with [ORG Ministry for External Relations  ] Under Secretary [PER Roberto Jaguaribe  ] who pointed out that working with the [LOC North Koreans  ] was often difficult because they always stick to their script . 
[PER Jaguaribe  ] said he believed the six party talks were the only way to proceed , but urged the [ORG USG  ] to also seek increased bilateral dialogue with the [LOC DPRK  ] . 
[PER Samore  ] , s statement that he did not see much short term prospect for [LOC North Korea  ] curtailing its nuclear program led to a lengthy discourse from [PER Jaguaribe  ] on the inefficacy of sanctions and the importance of dialogue , particularly via the six party process as this would bring the [LOC United States  ] , [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] together . 
[LOC Iran  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Samore  ] encouraged [LOC Brazil  ] to use its relatively good relations with [LOC Iran  ] to encourage a constructive approach to the international community . 
Despite offers of dialogue from [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC Iran  ] had not responded and had not halted enrichment activities . 
If [LOC Iran  ] does not respond soon , the [LOC U.S.  ] will have no choice but to turn to sanctions . 
Foreign Minister [PER Celso Amorim  ] urged engagement with [LOC Iran  ] and placing [LOC Iran  ] , s nuclear ambitions in the context of the larger [LOC Middle East  ] situation . 
He recommended that a way should be found not to make [LOC Iran  ] give up its enrichment activities , but to avoid enriched uranium being used for weapons . 
[PER Jaguaribe  ] said that [LOC Brazil  ] had advised the [MISC Iranian  ] government to respond to President [PER Obama  ] , s proposals constructively and believed that [LOC Iran  ] , s internal problems might lead to a more constructive approach to the international community . 
At the same time , both [PER Amorim  ] and [PER Jaguaribe  ] raised [LOC Israel  ] , s nuclear program as a primary reason for [MISC Iranian  ] behavior . 
Presidential Advisor [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] went further , citing [MISC Israeli  ] disarmament as a precondition for addressing [MISC Iranian  ] proliferation . 
[PER Garcia  ] offered [MISC Brazilian  ] assistance in promoting dialogue with both [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC North Korea  ] , but he would not commit to urging [LOC Iran  ] to suspend enrichment activity to allow time for dialogue on the issue . 
ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Samore  ] cited the adoption of an Additional Protocol to the NPT as an area in which [LOC Brazil  ] can add to its leadership role in the area of nonproliferation . 
He pointed out that many countries , including the [LOC United States  ] , had concerns about protecting proprietary technology and had been able to work out arrangements with the [ORG IAEA  ] that allowed them to sign APs . 
[ORG MRE  ] Director for Sensitive Technologies [PER Santiago Mourao  ] said that of the resistance in [LOC Brazil  ] to an [ORG AP  ] has come from the [ORG MOD  ] , which supervises [MISC Brazilian  ] enrichment operations run by the [MISC Brazilian  ] navy as part of its nuclear propulsion program . 
[ORG MOD  ] Chief of Staff [PER Murilo Barbosa  ] argued that an [ORG AP  ] for [LOC Brazil  ] was not necessary , because [LOC Brazil  ] already belonged to other nonproliferation regimes and maintained that [LOC Brazil  ] , s defense strategy ( which he helped write ) prevented further discussion . 
[PER Barbosa  ] also pointed out , as evidence of why an [ORG AP  ] is not needed , that [LOC Brazil  ] ( because of navy ownership of enrichment ) is the only [ORG NNWS  ] with a military facility under safeguards . 
During [PER Samore  ] , s visit to [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] , [ORG Nuclear Energy Commission  ] President [PER Goncalves  ] said that his organization had prepared &technical documents8 on the [ORG AP  ] but declined to discuss them absent a political decision to consider an [ORG AP  ] . 
[PER Mourao  ] stated that steps toward [ORG NWS  ] disarmament would be a precondition for [LOC Brazil  ] to consider an [ORG AP  ] . 
[PER Garcia  ] was slightly more positive on this point when he told [PER Samore  ] that the [ORG Administration  ] , s new openness to disarmament would be helpful. &I think we can reach a solution , 8 he said . 
Defense Minister [PER Jobim  ] did not evince such optimism but agreed that there was scope for work on possible technical solutions to [LOC Brazil  ] , s concerns . 
As a follow up to the discussions , [MISC Brazilian  ] officials agreed to host a visit by [LOC U.S.  ] experts to discuss the Additional Protocol . 
Other Issues: NPT RevCon , [ORG Nuclear Safety  ] , [ORG PSI  ] , [ORG Fuel Bank  ] , [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) In each of [PER Samore  ] , s meetings , the [MISC Brazilian  ] side praised President [PER Obama  ] , s [LOC Prague  ] speech as opening the way to a more successful NPT revcon in 2010 . 
[PER Amorim  ] expressed interest in discussing the revcon agenda with the [ORG P5  ] and urged greater consultations with the [ORG NNWS  ] . 
Similarly , [PER Amorim  ] and Under Secretary for Political Affairs [PER Machado  ] pushed for an increased [MISC Brazilian  ] role in FMCT negotiations and supported [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] bilateral consultations on disarmament ( without mentioning nonproliferation ) . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] responses to the proposed [ORG Nuclear Security Summit  ] were positive , though non-committal . 
[ORG Institutional Security Director  ] [PER Felix  ] reacted positively to future discussions on critical infrastructure protection , a new responsibility of his office . 
Similarly , [PER Machado  ] expressed interest in learning more about the [ORG PSI  ] and agreed to [LOC U.S.  ] proposal for expert talks on [ORG PSI  ] , but gave no indication that [LOC Brazil  ] was prepared to join [ORG PSI  ] . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] side indicated it would join consensus in support of [ORG IAEA  ] Director General [PER El Baradei  ] , s proposal for a nuclear fuel bank but expressed reservations about discouraging enrichment that could affect [LOC Brazil  ] , s nuclear industry . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] side also said they could &work with8 the proposed [MISC Australian  ] language for the [ORG Nuclear Supplier Group  ] guidelines for transfers of [LOC ENR.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) COMMENT . 
Post regards the [PER Samore  ] visit as producing opportunities for further dialogue on nonproliferation issues . 
[PER Samore  ] 's [MISC Brazilian  ] contacts expressed themselves to be open to further discussions and were pleased to be approached as an important partner on global issues . 
That said , it is clear that [LOC Brazil  ] 's positions will not change in the short term . 
[LOC Brazil  ] will still champion the [ORG NNWS  ] and highlight disarmament over proliferation and will prefer to cite [LOC Iran  ] 's right to peaceful nuclear energy rather than focus on the dangers of proliferation in the [LOC Middle East  ] . 
While further dialogue may not produce rapid improvments in these positions , it will be key for developing a long-term relationship in which [LOC Brazil  ] becomes a more important global stability partner. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 .
