[PER Qureshi  ] explained the MFA had organized the briefing “considering the media hype and some irresponsible journalism on the [MISC Indian  ] side.” He reiterated the [MISC GOP  ] commitment to improve relations with [LOC India  ] , noted recent successful meetings on the [ORG Composite Dialogue  ] and between the two [ORG Interior Ministries  ] , and described the positive atmosphere during his recent trip to [LOC New Delhi  ] . 
Emphasizing that he had remained in [LOC India  ] even after the bombing to express condolences and condemnation , [PER Qureshi  ] described the attacks as “ghastly , tragic and inhumane.” But he lamented that the [MISC Indian  ] media began accusing [LOC Pakistan  ] instantaneously ; he repeated his mantra that the two sides must avoid the blame game and join hands against a common enemy. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 .

Terrorism was a major challenge for both countries , and they should enhance their cooperation and coordination to fight terrorism through sustained , multi-year cooperation .

) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Qureshi  ] announced that the Secretary was coming to [LOC Islamabad  ] after visiting [LOC India  ] . 
He noted that he had been in contact many of his counterparts , including the [LOC UK  ] , [MISC Italians  ] , [MISC Chinese  ] , [MISC Emiris  ] , and [ORG EU/Solana  ] and would try to call the [MISC French  ] and [MISC Canadians  ] . 
Noting again that the [MISC Indian  ] press was reporting all sorts of false information , including reports of troop mobilization , cuts in air/rail links and suggestions that ambassadors had been recalled , [PER Qureshi  ] asked the diplomatic corps to use its influence and restraint to calm the situation. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) After the meeting , MFA Additional Secretary for [LOC South Asia  ] [PER Aizaz Chaudhry  ] told [ORG Polcouns  ] that the [MISC GOP  ] was relieved that the [ORG GOI  ] had not made any specific allegations of official government involvement ; the problem was with the [MISC Indian  ] press . 
He noted that he had met with [ORG ISI  ] and reported that the phone numbers of the individual that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UK  ] had shared with [ORG ISI  ] were no longer working . 
Personally , [PER Chaudhry  ] agreed that the [MISC GOP  ] would have to take steps against LeT , and he had recommended that course of action to [LOC Queshi.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [MISC Spanish  ] ambassador advised that the [LOC UK  ] , [LOC France  ] , [LOC Germany  ] , [LOC Spain  ] and [LOC Italy  ] were forming a sub-group within the [ORG EU  ] led by President [PER Sarkozy  ] , who planned to call the [MISC Indian  ] and [MISC Pakistani  ] leaders on December 2 to urge [LOC India  ] not to demand too much and urge [LOC Pakistan  ] to deliver on the [MISC Indian  ] requests .

[MISC Indian  ] High [ORG Commission: Distinction between Civilians  ] and [ORG ISI  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Separately , the [MISC Indian  ] Polcouns [PER P. Kumaran  ] in [LOC Islamabad  ] told [ORG Polcouns  ] that the [ORG GOI  ] was making a distinction between the civilian government , which they firmly believed had no involvement in the attacks , and the military/ISI. “We are not yet ready to give [ORG ISI  ] a clean chit , ” although he said the [ORG GOI  ] was making no accusations , yet , of direct [ORG ISI  ] involvement . 
Based on its interrogation of the [MISC Pakistani  ] terrorist arrested during the attack , the [ORG GOI  ] is “absolutely certain” that the attacks originated in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
The individual arrested admitted he was trained in [LOC Karachi  ] and said he came from a village ( [LOC Faridkat  ] ) near [LOC Multan  ] , in the [LOC Punjab  ] . 
They also confiscated a satellite phone and traced calls to [LOC Lahore  ] , [LOC Jalalabad  ] and LeT training chief Muzammil. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) “We are still investigating , ” said [PER Kumaran  ] , and “at some stage” we would like the [ORG ISI  ] chief to visit and see what we can do together . 
He flatly denied there had been any phone call from FM [PER Mukherjee  ] to President [PER Zardari  ] . 
He emphasized that [LOC India  ] has issued no war warnings to [LOC Pakistan  ] and had not mobilized its forces . 
There would , however , be a “pause” in the relationship ; the length of that pause would depend on what actions the [MISC Pakistanis  ] took . 
During anti-terrorism bilaterals , the [ORG GOI  ] had given the names of 19-20 fugitives to the [MISC GOP  ] that they wanted arrested . 
A good place to start rapprochement , according to [PER Kumaran  ] , would be for the [MISC GOP  ] to start turning over some of these fugitives . 
[MISC Indian  ] HC Meets [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Kumaran  ] confirmed that the [MISC Indian  ] High Commissioner called December 2 on [LOC Pakistan  ] [MISC Muslim League-N  ] leader [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] , saying that the [MISC Indian  ] Embassy had a policy of “staying in touch” with [PER Nawaz  ] .

Otherwise , [PER Nawaz  ] used the opportunity to criticize President [PER Zardari  ] , announce the [MISC PML-N  ] would start a campaign against Chief [PER Justice Dogar  ] ( over allegations he secured a higher test score for his daughter in exams ) , and criticized the government for not implementing the joint parliamentary resolution on extremism and giving former President [PER Musharraf VIP  ] treatment . 
PM Holds All Parties Meeting <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( SBU ) Following a meeting called to brief all the political parties on the [MISC Indo-Pak  ] situation , PM [PER Gilani  ] issued a press statement saying: the [MISC GOP  ] extends its hand of cooperation to [LOC India  ] and are willing to jointly investigate the recent events ; both sides should exhibit seriousness and patience ; this was not a time for trading blame ; the whole nation is united to defend [LOC Pakistan  ] and there is a complete coordination between Pakistan’s armed forces and its government ; and there is no fear of war because we are in touch with our friends .
