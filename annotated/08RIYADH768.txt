END SUMMARY . 
[LOC Lebanon:  ] A “Military” Problem with a [ORG Military Solution  ] --------------------------------------------- --------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) Opening a discussion with S/I [PER Satterfield  ] focused largely on [LOC Iraq  ] , [PER Saud  ] first turned to [LOC Lebanon  ] and stated that the effort by “Hizballah and Iran” to take over [LOC Beirut  ] was the first step in a process that would lead to the overthrow of the [ORG Siniora  ] government and an “Iranian takeover of all [ORG Lebanon.” Such  ] a victory , combined with [MISC Iranian  ] actions in [LOC Iraq  ] and on the [MISC Palestinian  ] front , would be a disaster for the [LOC US  ] and the entire region . 
[PER Saud  ] argued that the present situation in [LOC Beirut  ] was “entirely military” and that the solution must be military as well . 
The [ORG Lebanese Armed Forces  ] ( [ORG LAF  ] ) were too fragile to bear more pressure ; they needed urgent backing to secure [LOC Beirut  ] from Hizballah’s assault . 
What was needed was an “Arab force” drawn from [MISC Arab  ] “periphery” states to deploy to [LOC Beirut  ] under the “cover of the [ORG UN”  ] and with a significant presence drawn from [MISC UNIFIL  ] in south [LOC Lebanon  ] “which is sitting doing nothing.” The [LOC US  ] and [ORG NATO  ] would be asked to provide equipment for such a force as well as logistics , movement support , and “naval and air cover.” <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [PER Satterfield  ] asked what support this concept had from [ORG Siniora  ] and from other [MISC Arab  ] states . 
[PER Saud  ] responded that “Siniora strongly supports , ” but that only [LOC Jordan  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] “as well as [ORG Arab League  ] SYG [PER Moussa”  ] were aware of the proposal , lest premature surfacing result in its demise . 
No contacts had been made with [LOC Syria  ] on any [LOC Beirut  ] developments , [PER Saud  ] said , adding , “what would be the use ? ” An “Easier Battle to Win” ------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [PER Saud  ] said that of all the regional fronts on which [LOC Iran  ] was now advancing , the battle in [LOC Lebanon  ] to secure peace would be an “easier battle to win” ( than [LOC Iraq  ] or on the [MISC Palestinian  ] front ) . 
[PER Satterfield  ] said that the “political and military” feasibility of the undertaking [PER Saud  ] had outlined would appear very much open to question . 
In particular , attempting to establish a new mandate for [MISC UNIFIL  ] would be very problematic . 
[PER Satterfield  ] said the [LOC US  ] would carefully RIYADH 00000768 002 OF 002 study any [MISC Arab  ] decision on a way forward . 
[PER Saud  ] concluded by underscoring that a [MISC UN/Arab  ] peace-keeping force coupled with [LOC US  ] air and naval support would “keep out [ORG Hezbollah  ] forever” in [LOC Lebanon.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 .
