REASONS: 1.4 ( B & D ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Mr. Secretary: You will shortly receive for approval [ORG G/TIP  ] 's annual trafficking report that drops the [LOC Netherlands  ] from [ORG Tier  ] 1 to [ORG Tier  ] 2 . 
I understand that while [ORG A/S Beth Jones  ] disagrees with this ranking , she has found it futile to continue to argue . 
Before you allow [ORG G/TIP  ] 's ranking of the [LOC Netherlands  ] to stand , I want to give you my first hand view of the situation and the consequences. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) Last year over [ORG G/TIP  ] 's objections , you orrectly laced the [LOC Netherlands  ] in [ORG Tier  ] 1 . 
[ORG G/TIP  ] and [ORG EUR  ] then developed benchmarks for engaging the [MISC Dutch  ] on TIP issues . 
So , where are we a year later ? - The TIP situation in the [LOC Netherlands  ] has actually improved in every area specified by law: protection , prosecution and prevention . 
( We have provided all the details to the Department and have shared them with your staff . 
) - The [MISC Dutch  ] are committing substantial resources towards the fight against TIP and the [LOC Netherlands  ] is one of the few countries that has a national rapporteur for trafficking. - The [MISC Dutch  ] championed the fight against TIP during their [ORG OSCE  ] chairmanship and will do so in their upcoming [ORG EU  ] presidency starting July First. - They have worked cooperatively with us on every benchmark we have given them over the past year. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The real issue seems to be the [MISC Dutch  ] approach to prostitution . 
We don't like their social policies , but even [ORG G/TIP  ] admits the causal link between legalization of prostitution and trafficking has not been proven . 
We have our view and the [MISC Dutch  ] theirs - viewing legalization as an attempt to gain control of the problems involved with prostitution and crime , including trafficking in persons in the sex industry . 
But this is a different question than those set out in the law and not a basis for changing their tier rostitution was just as legal here a year ago when they were ranked in [ORG Tier  ] 1. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Among other reasons , I am asking you to overrule [ORG G/TIP  ] so the [LOC U.S.  ] will be credible on TIP issues . 
For effective engagement with the [MISC Dutch  ] on TIP , we must acknowledge their efforts , set clear guidelines and stick to them , then evaluate fairly according to the benchmarks . 
Anything less will undermine our credibility and [MISC Dutch  ] desire to cooperate . 
Senior [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG Justice  ] and [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] officials have already complained strongly about moving goalposts and an unfair process driven by ideology , not benchmarks. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Mr. Secretary , the [MISC Dutch  ] are hopping mad over this . 
I am concerned we are going to shoot ourselves , and this relationship , in the foot . 
The indignity of an unjustified downgrade to [ORG Tier  ] 2 -- and our inability to point to any criteria or performance that have changed for the worse -- is going to undermine the forceful public outreach we have been making to strengthen the alliance . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are extremely valuable allies to us , providing troops in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] and supporting us on transatlantic and global issues . 
In the next month , the government faces a delicate vote in parliament over extending [LOC Iraq  ] troop deployment and the [ORG MFA Political Director  ] told me Friday that a decision to put the [LOC Netherlands  ] in [ORG Tier  ] 2 would be damaging and could not come at a worse time . 
In July , the [MISC Dutch  ] assume the [ORG EU  ] presidency and will pick up from the [MISC Irish  ] on counter-terrorism , the [MISC Greater Middle East  ] and the whole [MISC US-EU  ] agenda . 
We need cooperation with the [LOC Netherlands  ] both on TIP issues and these other profoundly important issues across the board. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( SBU ) Both the facts and [LOC U.S.  ] interests lead to the same conclusion , Mr. Secretary . 
I urge you to keep the [LOC Netherlands  ] where it has been and belongs , in [ORG Tier  ] 1 .
