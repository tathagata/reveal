The 2010 presidential election in [LOC Brazil  ] , fifteen months out , currently looks like a two person contest between Minister [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] and [LOC Sao Paulo  ] Governor [PER Jose Serra  ] . 
Although [PER Serra  ] maintains his lead in the polls , [PER Rousseff  ] 's steady rise in public opinion has some analysts already labeling her the favorite . 
Without either having clear frontrunner status established and few evident policy differences between these two mainstream leftist candidates , they will try to persuade low income voters of their firmer commitment to ongoing social programs , and middle and upper income voters of their greater managerial competence . 
Analysts say both major parties--Rousseff 's [ORG Workers' Party  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) and [PER Serra  ] 's Social [MISC Democrats  ] ( [ORG PSDB  ] ) --will try to win massively in their regional strongholds and reduce their opponent 's edge as much as possible where they do not expect to win . 
The non-ideological [ORG Brazilian Democratic Movement Party  ] ( [ORG PMDB  ] ) could play a decisive role and both leading parties would like to form an alliance with it . 
A steady stream of political scandals and the accompanying revelations could change the landscape suddenly and surprisingly . 
Despite the unpredictability that is typical of [MISC Brazilian  ] politics , institutional stability is as great as it has ever been in the post-military dictatorship period . 
End summary . 
Two [ORG Person Race  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The October 2010 presidential election in [LOC Brazil  ] , fifteen months out , looks like a two person contest between [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] ( [ORG PT  ] ) , Minister-chief of the [LOC Civilian Household  ] , and [PER Jose Serra  ] ( [ORG PSDB  ] ) , governor of the state of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
[PER Rousseff  ] , President [PER Lula  ] 's handpicked choice to succeed him , is the president 's top domestic policy adviser , whom he has given a lead role and high visibility in the execution of the Accelerated [ORG Growth Program  ] ( [ORG PAC  ] ) , a massive public works program . 
[PER Serra  ] , a former minister of health and planning under President [PER Fernando Henrique Cardoso  ] , [PER Lula  ] 's predecessor , is governor of [LOC Brazil  ] 's most economically important state , and its most populous one ( refs A and B ) . 
[PER Serra: Slow  ] and [ORG Steady..  ] . 
[PER Serra  ] maintains the overall lead in early polling , with numbers remaining in the range of 40 percent . 
In keeping with his administrative style ( [LOC Sao Paulo  ] septel ) [PER Serra  ] is keeping a low profile at the moment as he carefully lines up federal monies for a stream of [LOC PAC-like  ] projects to announce at the state level when the national campaign accelerates . 
[PER Dilma  ] on the Rise <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The story of recent months is [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] 's rise in the polls , from single digits late last year to mid-teens earlier this year to as high as 24 percent in May ( depending on which candidates are included in the poll ) . 
Her rise is the result of her heightened public visibility in [ORG PAC  ] events , [PER Lula  ] 's declared support , and her apparently rapid recovery from lymphatic cancer . 
[ORG PATRI  ] 's [PER Miranda  ] said that the public perception that she has quickly defeated cancer plays strongly in her favor . 
While [PER Miranda  ] and some [ORG PT  ] officials such as [PER Luis Marinho  ] believe that , if by March 2010 she is tied with [PER Serra  ] in the polls , he could yield his [ORG PSDB  ] candidacy to [ORG Minas Gerais  ] Governor [PER Aecio Neves  ] , other observers such [PER Serra  ] colleague and former [ORG Central Banker Luiz  ] [PER Fernando Figueiredo  ] downplayed the influence of polling on [PER Serra  ] 's plans . 
As long as [PER Rousseff  ] continues to look like a fighter who conquered cancer , her presidential chances will improve . 
If her cancer recurs and makes her candidacy impossible , the [ORG PT  ] has no alternative of her stature , although former Finance Minister [PER Antonio Palocci  ] and Presidential Chief of Staff [PER Gilberto Carvalho  ] are sometimes named as possible candidates ( ref C ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The relatively minor effect of the global financial crisis in [LOC Brazil  ] helps [PER Rousseff  ] as a member of the incumbent party. . 
Developments in the ongoing scandal involving [ORG Senate  ] President [PER Jose Sarney  ] ( septel ) could play in [PER Rousseff  ] 's favor as well . 
Thanks to President [PER Lula  ] 's intervention with [ORG PT  ] senators , [PER Sarney  ] 's chances of retaining the [ORG Senate  ] presidency are improved-- meaning the [ORG PT  ] is better positioned to demand stronger concrete support for [PER Rousseff  ] 's candidacy from the [ORG PMDB  ] in the general election . 
Several " [MISC Also-Rans  ] " <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Aside from [PER Rousseff  ] and [PER Serra  ] , other candidates are unlikely to gain sufficient support to make it a three- or four-person race . 
Prospects for a run by the young , charismatic governor of [ORG Minas Gerais  ] state , [PER Aecio Neves  ] , the strongest of the second tier candidates , appear to be waning . 
However , if [PER Serra  ] 's prospects were to nose-dive because of a scandal , health concerns , or a serious blunder , [PER Neves  ] would be the obvious choice for the [ORG PSDB  ] . 
Alternatively , [PER Neves  ] could switch parties to run as a [ORG PMDB  ] , [ORG PSB  ] or even [ORG Green Party  ] ( [ORG PV  ] ) candidate , but would have to do so by October 2009 ( see ref C ) . <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Alternative names will continue to surface , and there will certainly be a handful of other candidates from other parties ranging from nationally important to " dwarf " parties . 
" [MISC Also-rans  ] " currently in the news include [PER Heloisa Helena  ] , leader of the [MISC Socialism  ] and [ORG Freedom Party  ] ( [ORG PSOL  ] ) , a small far left party , who came in third in 2006 with 6.85 percent , and [PER Ciro Gomes  ] , a federal deputy from the [ORG Brazilian Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG PSB  ] ) . 
In 1998 , [PER Gomes  ] came in third for president with 11 percent of the vote , and in 2002 came in fourth with 12 percent . 
He is positioning himself to run for governor of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] or for president as a second pro-Lula candidate . 
In either case , he would do [PER Rousseff  ] and the [ORG PT  ] the favor of being the hatchet man against [PER Serra  ] , with the expectation of a cabinet position if [PER Rousseff  ] won . 
Under current circumstances , these second-tier candidates stand little chance of surpassing either of the two front-runners . 
The last two presidential elections were also primarily contests between the [ORG PSDB  ] and the [ORG PT  ] , and the broad political alignment remains the same as it was in 2002 and 2006 . 
Third Term for President [PER Lula  ] ? <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) President [PER Lula  ] has repeatedly and convincingly stated he does not want to serve a third consecutive term , which would require a constitutional amendment ( [ORG PEC  ] ) enacted not less than a year before the election . 
This month , a [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] committee probably put an end to any possible amendment when it overwhelmingly voted down such a proposal . 
Federal Deputy [PER Jose Genoino  ] , a senior [ORG PT  ] figure , recommended its rejection , signally the party 's opposition to a third consecutive term . 
Given the lead time necessary to approve a [ORG PEC  ] and the [ORG PT  ] 's opposition , the chances of a 2011-2015 [PER Lula  ] presidency can now be ruled out . 
Some analysts , including [PER Andre Miranda  ] , and many opposition figures now believe [PER Lula  ] plans to run in 2014 , in which case he could serve two additional terms . 
Strategies Beginning to Take Shape <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) Analysts say that [PER Rousseff  ] and [PER Serra  ] are developing similar campaign strategies: try to win massively in their bases with a single overall message , and diminish the other party 's margin of victory in its stronghold with a single , different , and resonant message . 
[PER Thiago de Aragao  ] , of the [MISC Arko Advice  ] consulting firm , said the [ORG PT  ] is probably unbeatable in the north and northeast , home to a large percentage of [LOC Brazil  ] 's poor , and will reinforce its image as the guarantor of generous social welfare programs such as the [ORG Bolsa Familia  ] ( Family Stipend ) . 
At the same time , the [ORG PT  ] will attack [PER Serra  ] in the south and southeast , where the [ORG PSDB  ] is strongest , with a message of demonstrated executive competence through [PER Rousseff  ] 's leading role in the [ORG PAC  ] . 
In the south and southeast , [PER Serra  ] will run on his record as governor of [LOC Sao Paulo  ] to persuade voters he has the administrative competency and leadership to be president . 
In the north and northeast , [PER Aragao  ] believes , [PER Serra  ] will try to reassure the poor that he would maintain social spending . 
He will also try to associate the [ORG PT  ] with ongoing corruption scandals , although it will not be the most important message for voters , [PER Aragao  ] said . 
Wooing the [ORG PMDB  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) The [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Democratic Mvement Party  ] ( [ORG PMDB  ] ) , [LOC Brazil  ] 's largest political arty , will play a crucial and probably decisive ole in the election . 
The [ORG PMDB  ] , a fractured and no-ideological confederation of state organization that often form alliances for local reasons , oftn prefers to play a supporting role to a presidetial candidate rather than running its own , allowig it to enter the government with the winner or , if on the losing side , to seek concessions from he winner exchange for joining the government coaition . 
According to [PER Andre Miranda  ] , of the [ORG PATRI  ] cnsulting firm , and [PER Thiago de Aragao  ] , both partie are wooing the [ORG PMDB  ] because , as the holder of te most seats in congress and more mayoral slots han any other party , the [ORG PMDB  ] can take advantage of a vast network of influential local politicians who get the vote out . 
The [ORG PMDB  ] is in the [PER Lula  ] government coalition , and analysts expect the party will back [PER Rousseff  ] , putting it in a position to demand the vice presidential slot. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( U ) A less likely possibility is a [MISC PSDB-PMDB  ] alliance , which cannot be ruled out because , according to [PER Aragao  ] , old rivalries make a [MISC PT-PMDB  ] alliance impossible in nine states . 
Moreover , a powerful [ORG PMDB  ] figure in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , [PER Orestes Quercia  ] , has already pledged to support [PER Jose Serra  ] . 
( [PER Note: Quercia  ] 's support would be in exchange for [PER Serra  ] 's support for [PER Quercia  ] 's expected run for the [ORG Senate  ] in 2010 . 
End note . 
) Possible [ORG PMDB  ] vice presidential running mates include [PER Sergio Cabral  ] , governor of [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] , [PER Michel Temer  ] , president of the [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] , and [PER Nelson Jobim  ] , the Defense Minister . 
[PER Miranda  ] said the [ORG PMDB  ] might increase the ticket 's appeal in the south and southeast by choosing a southerner such as [PER Nelson Jobim  ] , of [LOC Rio Grande  ] do Sul . 
State Alliances a Complicating [MISC Factor  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) The effort by [PER Rousseff  ] and [PER Serra  ] to build support beyond their respective bases is being complicated by the need for parties to build coalitions in support of their candidates in the simultaneous races for state deputy , federal deputy , senator , and governor . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] parties traditionally form state and federal alliances in support of a slate of candidates for these races , but alliances in favor of state and federal candidates often differ from those at the local level . 
Local rivalries often make state-level alliances in support of a national candidate difficult , and local politics often make for strange bedfellows . 
Several state [ORG PMDB  ] branches are bitter rivals of the [ORG PT  ] and will not back a state or national [ORG PT  ] candidate . 
Under [MISC Brazilian  ] law , parties are free to enter regional coalitions that are different from coalitions in support of a presidential candidate . 
The result is a complex and unpredictable patchwork of alliances that may or may not be effective in mustering a party 's support for a presidential candidate . 
For example , in [LOC Pernambuco  ] the [ORG PMDB  ] traditionally allies with the [ORG PSDB  ] and [ORG DEM  ] at the state level , and can be expected to do so even if [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] 's running mate is from the [ORG PMDB  ] . 
The Limits of Early Polling <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Early polls are not particularly reliable in [LOC Brazil  ] as a result of low party membership ( less than ten percent of voters ) and the non-ideological nature of [MISC Brazilian  ] politics . 
The similarities between the platforms of the two most likely candidates and their equally matched ( i.e. , limited ) personal charisma are also factors that could allow small events or mistakes to carry out-sized weight during the campaign . 
One additional reason for the low reliability of early polls is the extreme influence of television advertising among the masses in the run-up to the first round . 
Campaign advertising in electronic media is strictly regulated by law , presidential candidates are allotted the same amount of free advertising time , all stations must broadcast the campaign messages simultaneously . 
The season for presidential campaign messages is short and opens only two months before the election . 
As a result , this advertising may cause sudden changes in the candidates' relative popularity . 
[PER Electoral Volatility  ] , [ORG Institutional Stability  ] <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Fifteen months , the time remaining before the October 2010 presidential election , is a long time in [MISC Brazilian  ] politics . 
Although [PER Serra  ] , the favorite to win only six months ago , has lost some ground to [PER Rousseff  ] , the inherent volatility of the political process will make it difficult to pick the winner up to the end . 
A steady stream of political scandals and the accompanying revelations could change the landscape suddenly and surprisingly . 
In 2006 , the " bloodsuckers " scandal sent the presidential race to a second round , although it did not change the result . 
The outcome of the [ORG Senate  ] scandal and its possible effects on the 2010 election are still unclear ( ref D , septel ) . 
[PER Rousseff  ] 's lymphatic cancer introduces an uncertainty that could invalidate calculations about the election 's outcome ( ref C ) . 
But in spite of the unpredictability that is typical of [MISC Brazilian  ] politics , institutional stability is as great as it has ever been in the post-military dictatorship period . 
The system is dealing fairly well with scandals and there are no signs of a turn toward populism or the possibility of anything but strict constitutional order. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( U ) Mission [LOC Brazil  ] takes the opportunity of his final cable to say farewell to [PER Dale Prince  ] , our lead domestic political analyst for the last three years , whose in-depth knowledge , insights , and contacts we will miss . 
This cable was cleared by Consulate General [LOC Sao Paulo  ] .
