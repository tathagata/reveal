( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: A [MISC Turkish  ] businessman who deals extensively in [LOC Iran  ] told us that the only way to do business there safely is through an [MISC Iranian  ] partner with high-level regime connections , in his case a partner he claims is connected to the son of Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] .

End summary . 
An insider 's perspective ---------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) We met recently with [PER Keyhan Ozdemir  ] ( please strictly protect ) , a director of [LOC Pars-Invest  ] , a [MISC Turkish  ] company with construction , real estate , and energy investments in [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Ozdemir  ] claims to have [MISC Iranian  ] business partners with direct connections to Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] 's family , including an [MISC Iranian  ] business partner who claims a close personal connection to [PER Khamenei  ] 's son [PER Mojtaba  ] . 
[PER Ozdemir  ] does not participate in [MISC Turkish  ] business-sponsored conferences or trade fairs with [MISC Iranian  ] counterparts , such as the early October [ORG Turkey-Iran Business Council  ] ( [ORG TIBC  ] ) conference ( ref C ) , dismissing them as " window dressing " . 
Instead , he candidly asserted to us that to get deals done in [LOC Iran  ] a foreign company needs a well-connected [MISC Iranian  ] " protector " , preferably a partner with [ORG IRGC  ] or Supreme Leader connections . 
Reinforcing that point , [PER Ozdemir  ] explained that the [ORG Turkey-Iran  ] commerce has slowed down considerably in 2009 in large part for three reasons , two political and one economic: ( 1 ) Most [MISC Turkish  ] companies , which are not politically " plugged-in " inside [LOC Iran  ] , drew back from [MISC Iranian  ] investment following the June elections out of fear of political risk . 
" These are the companies that need trade associations like the [ORG TIBC  ] to make introductions for them . 
" ( 2 ) [MISC Turkish  ] companies that had been well connected to former President [PER Rafsanjani  ] 's business empire have been edged out since June by [ORG IRGC  ] companies and by [PER IRGC-affiliated Bonyads  ] ( politically-connected charitable foundations that act as holding companies ) , and ( 3 ) [LOC Turkey  ] 's investment of [MISC Iranian  ] hydrocarbons has been down significantly in 2009 . 
On the other hand , [PER Ozdemir  ] concurs with the conventional wisdom that [ORG Turkey-Iran  ] trade will increase in the remainder of 2009 and into 2010 . 
He says he is optimistic that his own biggest pending deal -- to develop a modern shopping mall in [LOC Tehran  ] -- will soon receive funding approval from the [LOC Tehran  ] municipality , reflective of the [MISC Iranian  ] economy 's resiliency even in hard times. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The key sector to watch , according to [PER Ozdemir  ] , is the banking sector , as [MISC Turkish-Iran  ] trade cannot expand significantly without more efficient banking cooperation . 
[PER Ozdemir  ] told us that [MISC Turkish  ] state-owned banks [ORG Halk  ] and [ORG Ziraat  ] have been quietly seeking [MISC Turkish  ] and [MISC Iranian  ] government permission to open bank branch offices in [LOC Tehran  ] . 
( [ORG Halk  ] and [ORG Ziraat  ] already have small " representative offices " in [LOC Tehran  ] , he claimed , but these offices do not perform banking functions . 
) The primary function would be to offer banking services to [MISC Turkish  ] companies and investors in [LOC Iran  ] , to give them a banking option other than [ORG Bank Mellat  ] , the lone [MISC Iranian  ] bank that operates in [LOC Turkey  ] . 
According to [PER Ozdemir  ] , the GoT has cautioned [ORG Halk  ] and [ORG Ziraat  ] to " go slow " until it becomes more clear whether international diplomacy with [LOC Iran  ] succeeds or fails , and thus whether the risk of significantly tougher banking sanctions on [LOC Iran  ] lessens or [ORG ISTANBUL  ] 00000399 002 OF 002 increases . 
Most of [PER Ozdemir  ] 's deals in [LOC Iran  ] are paid in [MISC Euros  ] , as " [MISC Iranians  ] prefer [LOC Euros  ] to ( [MISC Turkish  ] ) [MISC Lira  ] and [LOC Turks  ] definitely don't want ( [MISC Iranian  ] ) Rials . 
" <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Regarding [LOC Iran  ] 's approach to privatization , [PER Ozdemir  ] asserted that privatizing certain sectors is a genuine priority for [PER Khamenei  ] , though he does not want to push the bureaucracy ( including the [ORG IRGC  ] ) too hard . 
According to [PER Ozdemir  ] , [PER Khamenei  ] is willing to continue to push for so-called privatization in the petrochemical industry , electricity production and distribution , transportation , " some " shipping and banking , and some [PER Bonyads  ] . 
But [PER Ozdemir  ] underscored that [PER Khamenei  ] is committed to keeping the telecommunications and hydrocarbon sectors is " safe hands . 
" The chief problem is that [MISC Iranian  ] decision-makers " don't understand what privatization means . 
" Selling a state-run bank or a telecommunications company to a holding company that itself is controlled by regime entities ( per ref C ) " is not privatization . 
" [PER Ozdemir  ] said that [LOC Tehran  ] Mayor [PER Qalibaf  ] , alone among [LOC Iran  ] 's top leadership , understands and supports the western concept of privatization and the need for [LOC Iran  ] to have a stronger private sector . 
[PER Qalibaf  ] already running for 2013 Presidential elections --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) From discussions with [LOC Tehran  ] municipality officials reporting directly to [LOC Tehran  ] Mayor [PER Qalibaf  ] , [PER Ozdemir  ] assessed that [PER Qalibaf  ] is already in full campaign mode for the 2013 [MISC Iranian  ] Presidential election . 
[PER Qalibaf  ] is actively maneuvering behind the scenes to lock in support from Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] , and indeed [PER Qalibaf  ] 's decision not to run in the June election this year was based on an unspoken understanding that staying out this time would position him well to be the establishment 's preferred choice next time . 
According to [PER Ozdemir  ] , [PER Qalibaf  ] is using the benefits of his office to build a sizable war-chest of campaign funds , though he is careful to ensure that his and his staff 's " energetic " collection of such funds does not adversely impact [LOC Tehran  ] 's municipal services or other operations , or his reputation as an effective manager . 
" Time is Running Out " to make a deal with [PER Khamenei  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Turning to a brief discussion of current diplomacy vis-a-vis [LOC Iran  ] , [PER Ozdemir  ] urged the [ORG USG  ] to " make a deal " with [LOC Iran  ] soon , because " time is running out " . 
He hinted that [PER Ayatollah Khamenei  ] 's health is a concern . 
[PER Khamenei  ] wants to ensure a smooth succession for his son , [PER Mojtaba  ] , to succeed him , but [PER Ozdemir  ] assessed that the installation of a new Supreme Leader in [LOC Iran  ] , if it becomes necessary in the coming year or two , could lead to a period of instability that would be inconducive to engagement between [LOC Iran  ] and the [ORG U.S. Comment  ] ------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) We cannot confirm the veracity of [PER Ozdemir  ] 's claim that his [MISC Iranian  ] business partner is personally close to [PER Mojtaba Khamenei  ] , although we have met that [MISC Iranian  ] business partner ( ref A ) and can confirm that his claims to a [PER Khamenei  ] family connection are at least plausible . 
We also have no basis to judge [PER Ozdemir  ] 's claims of failing health on the part of Supreme Leader [PER Khamenei  ] , beyond having heard similar rumors from other contacts ( Ref B ) . 
We give serious credence to [PER Ozdemir  ] 's claim that for a foreign company to do business effectively in [LOC Iran  ] , it must have a regime-affiliated partner or protector working on its behalf within the system .
