09 THE HAGUE 0078 Classified By: [MISC Political-Economic  ] Counselor [PER Andrew Mann  ] for reasons 1.5 ( b , d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( S ) SUMMARY: [MISC Dutch  ] plans for [LOC Afghanistan  ] post-2010 are evolving . 
Many in [ORG Parliament  ] and the public think the [MISC Dutch  ] should withdraw completely in 2010 since their forces have been on the ground with the [LOC U.S.  ] since December 2001 . 
Despite confidence in their own efforts , the [MISC Dutch  ] perceive there is no winnable game plan for creating a stable democratic [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Nonetheless , current indications from the government suggest the [LOC Netherlands  ] may consider a request for some sort of follow-on mission after 2010 . 
Getting to that " " yes " " will take extended , coordinated and discreet engagement by all concerned . 
END SUMMARY . 
Uncertainty about [MISC Dutch  ] Deployment ---------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) In December 2007 , the [ORG Dutch Parliament  ] agreed to extend its [ORG ISAF  ] mission in [LOC Uruzgan  ] for two years - until August 2010 , followed by a complete withdrawal of [MISC Dutch  ] troops under [ORG Task Force Uruzgan  ] by December 2010 . 
In private conversations , senior government officials have emphasized that the [MISC Dutch  ] will stay on in some capacity in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Official public statements , however , are less forward-leaning . 
Foreign Minister [PER Verhagen  ] said during an appearance in [ORG Parliament  ] on November 19 , " " the [LOC Netherlands  ] is lead nation , in [LOC Uruzgan  ] until August 2010 and will then cut down its presence and leave by December 2010 . 
" " He added that the development relationship will continue for years , but he would not make any observations about military contributions after December 2010 . 
At the same hearing , Defense Minister [PER van Middelkoop  ] stated the [MISC Dutch  ] " " do not have the capabilities to sustain lead operations over several years . 
" " During a December visit to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , he said the [MISC Dutch  ] were getting out of [LOC Afghanistan  ] , even if incoming [LOC U.S.  ] President [PER Obama  ] called him 10 times to stay . 
Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] later repudiated [PER van Middelkoop  ] , s remarks , stating a request by the new administration would be given careful consideration . 
The PM cautioned , however , " " A mission with as many troops as currently in [LOC Uruzgan  ] is going to be difficult . 
" " During his trip to [LOC Uruzgan  ] on February 9 , the PM further stated " " We have always said that we will terminate the leading role of the [LOC Netherlands  ] in [LOC Uruzgan  ] by 2010 . 
But that does not mean that we will turn our back on [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
At least we will take responsibility after 2010 in the area of development cooperation and strengthening the administration . 
" " <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In conversations with EUR/WE Director [PER Pamela Spratlen  ] January 15 , [MISC Dutch  ] MPs from the leading parties that supported the [LOC Afghanistan  ] deployment in 2007 -- Labor ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) , [MISC Christian Democrats  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) , and [MISC Liberals  ] ( [ORG VVD  ] ) -- told [PER Spratlen  ] the [MISC Dutch  ] military needs a break from the [LOC Afghanistan  ] deployment . 
" " It would be suicide for parties at this table " " to extend the [MISC Dutch  ] mandate in [LOC Uruzgan  ] beyond 2010 , according to [ORG VVD  ] member [PER Han Ten Broeke  ] , though this " " doesn't mean we couldn't be somewhere else.. . 
We made a promise to conclude in 2010 . 
" " [ORG CDA  ] Defense spokesman [PER Raymond Knops  ] said it is " " possible the [MISC Dutch  ] may contribute again in 2013 ( after a two-year QDutch may contribute again in 2013 ( after a two-year break ) .. . 
We need some rest . 
" " [ORG PvdA  ] member [PER Samira Bouchibti  ] nodded at these comments , adding , " " we have to explain to the [MISC Dutch  ] people why this matters . 
" " <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Public support for the mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] is tracked monthly by the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] with the long term trend being basically stable ( approximately 35-41% in favor , 30-37% opposed and 23-27% undecided ) . 
Recent short term trends have been somewhat negative with January support at 30% ; April 2008 at 25% was the lowest . 
A consistent majority expresses pride in the [MISC Dutch  ] troops in [LOC Uruzgan  ] ( 60% in January ) , but public interest in [LOC Afghanistan  ] is diminishing . 
Decision process ---------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) The initial , informal and unofficial process of deciding what to do after 2010 has begun at the senior levels in the Ministries . 
A meeting of the " " Gang of Six " " ( [PER Balkenende  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) , [PER Verhagen  ] ( [ORG CDA  ] ) , Deputy Prime Minister/Minister of Finance Bos ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) , Minister for [ORG Development Cooperation Koenders  ] ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) , Deputy Prime Minister/Minister for Youth and Family Rouvet ( [ORG Christian Union  ] - [ORG CU  ] ) , and [PER van Middelkoop  ] ( [ORG CU  ] ) ) to discuss post-2010 [LOC Afghanistan  ] options was scheduled for January 29 . 
It was postponed and has not yet been rescheduled . 
Following a request for post-2010 involvement ( from [ORG NATO  ] or the [MISC Afghan  ] government ) , the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] will notify [ORG Parliament  ] and with the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] and [ORG Development Cooperation  ] draw up a plan of engagement . 
The [ORG Cabinet  ] will review and approve the plan , likely in the fall of 2009 . 
The [ORG Cabinet  ] will then send a letter to [ORG Parliament  ] formally notifying it of the government 's intent , initiating parliamentary review and debate ( likely in late 2009 or early 2010 ) . 
The decision will , as in 2007 , follow an exhaustive review of key options including total withdrawal , reduction of contributions , reformation of forces , and repositioning of forces as well as testimony by outside experts . 
Dr. [PER Henk Ormel  ] , Chair of the [ORG Parliament  ] 's [ORG Standing Committee  ] on [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] , told a university audience Feb. 10 that the wording of the 2007 mandate to leave [ORG Uruzgan  ] left plenty of room for a future role in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He believes there will be a " " serious national discussion " " in late 2009 on the appropriate role for the [MISC Dutch  ] focusing on defense , diplomacy and , especially , development ( the 3D approach ) . 
KEY FACTORS FOR [LOC AFGHANISTAN  ] POST-2010 ------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S ) Robert [PER de Groot  ] , MFA Deputy Director General for [ORG Political Affairs  ] and the [ORG Ministry 's  ] point person on [LOC Afghanistan  ] , counseled the [LOC POL/ECON Counselor  ] in December 2008 not to view any one official 's comments in isolation . 
He suggested we balance the Defense Minister 's concern about an exhausted military with the Foreign Minister 's call for greater resources for the military . 
He explained the government told [ORG Parliament  ] during the 2007 debate the [LOC Netherlands  ] would stop being the lead nation for [ORG Task Force Uruzgan  ] in 2010 , " " that is all we promised . 
" " Nevertheless , [PER de Groot  ] said , before agreeing to a follow-on mission , the [MISC Dutch  ] would be influenced by: - CENTCOM Gen. Petreaus 's expected review of [MISC Afghan  ] strategy ; - The [LOC U.S.  ] overall plan for stabilizing [LOC Afghanistan  ] ( perhaps , [PER de Groot  ] mused , we need a " " new platform - a post-ISAF [ORG Phase III  ] " " for the south ) ; - [LOC Canada  ] 's plans ( since [PER de Groot  ] characterized its government 's announcement pulling out of [LOC Afghanistan  ] in 2010 as more categorical than the [MISC Dutch  ] position ) ; - The capacity of the [MISC Dutch  ] military ; - The new administration 's /NATO 's request of allies ( de [PER Groot  ] thought very few allies had the capabilities to contribute more , in a meaningful way , in [LOC Afghanistan  ] ) ; - The ability of the [MISC Afghans  ] to sustain development efforts ; and - The willingness of the central government in [LOC Kabul  ] to address governance issues ( e.g. , corruption ) . 
Declining Military Capabilities ? -------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S ) The [MISC Dutch  ] were one of our first partners in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , contributing a Special Forces [ORG Task Group  ] , infantry troops and staff officers to [ORG ISAF  ] in December 2001 . 
Qinfantry troops and staff officers to [ORG ISAF  ] in December 2001 . 
Since then , they have served as co-lead of [ORG ISAF  ] headquarters ( [LOC Feb.-Aug  ] . 
2003 ) , lead at [LOC PRT Pol-e-Khumri  ] ( [PER Baglan Province  ] 2004-2006 ) , command of [LOC Regional Command-South  ] ( Nov. 06-May 07 ; Nov. 08-present ) , and lead of [PER PRT  ] [PER Tarin Kowt  ] and [ORG Task Force Uruzgan  ] ( Oct. 06-present ) as well as contributing [MISC F-16s  ] , attack and transport helicopters , intelligence assets and trainers . 
As recounted to visiting EUR/WE Office Director [PER Spratlen  ] by the MFA , the [MISC Dutch  ] military , a volunteer force , is currently under strength ( only 34,000 personnel out of an authorized 41,000 ) , and [LOC Afghanistan  ] has taken its toll . 
Yet , by August 2010 , the [MISC Dutch  ] military will be even more experienced and heavily invested in the mission in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
While certain elements may have had " " all they can handle , " " the [MISC Dutch  ] will retain significant capabilities to contribute to the overall [ORG ISAF  ] mission in [MISC Afghanistan:  ] command and staff elements ; [ORG Operational Mentoring  ] and [ORG Liaison Teams  ] ( OMLT ) ; [ORG Provisional  ] Reconstruction Teams ( [LOC PRT  ] ) ; logistical support elements ; limited battle group elements ; close air support assets ; intelligence , surveillance , targeting and reconnaissance ( [ORG ISTAR  ] ) elements ; and staff billets . 
At the same time , other elements such as armored engineers and helicopter transport may not be combat-ready and , therefore , could limit the operations of the battle groups . 
Progress in [LOC Afghanistan  ] Governance and Reconstruction --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S ) The greatest single threat to [MISC Dutch  ] engagement is the perception there is no coherent , winnable game plan for creating a stable , democratic [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[MISC Dutch  ] confidence in their military and civilian engagements at the local levels in [LOC Uruzgan  ] remains strong . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] , however , are frustrated by the " " bungling " " of the central government in [LOC Kabul  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] question their own involvement in an international coalition that appears incapable or unwilling to develop a legitimate , sustainable [MISC Afghan  ] government . 
Decision Makers --------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) As in 2007 , the important players within the [ORG Cabinet  ] on this issue are [PER Balkenende  ] , [PER Verhagen  ] and , to a lesser extent , van [PER Middelkoop  ] . 
[PER Koenders  ] , interested in [MISC Afghan  ] development and governance issues , will be key to convincing Bos to give [ORG Labor/PvdA  ] support in the [ORG Cabinet  ] to any post-2010 engagement plan . 
Parties of the left -- [ORG D66  ] , the [ORG Socialist Party  ] ( [ORG SP  ] ) , and Greenleft -- will likely oppose any continued involvement . 
The conservative [ORG Freedom Party  ] ( [ORG PVV  ] ) and the [ORG VVD  ] will need to be convinced that any decision is clearly in the best interest of the [MISC Dutch  ] . 
Although the ruling coalition parties ( [ORG CDA  ] , [ORG PvdA  ] and [ORG CU  ] ) control enough votes in parliament to approve any [ORG Cabinet  ] action , [MISC Dutch  ] political tradition requires more than a simple majority to approve such an important action . 
The government will need the support of additional parties . 
Comment and [ORG First Steps  ] ----------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) Comment: Embassy The [ORG Hague  ] believes the [MISC Dutch  ] will ultimately stay in [LOC Afghanistan  ] for two primary reasons: to complete the mission and maintain a seat at the table as a " " responsible shareholder " " for international peace and security . 
It is paramount the [MISC Dutch  ] view any post-2010 engagement as partnering toward a viable [LOC Afghanistan  ] solution and not a continuation of a failing strategy ( hence de [PER Groot  ] 's desire for a " " post-ISAF [ORG Phase III  ] " " plan ) . 
A strategy that provides credible steps towards a central government that is responsive to the citizenry and capable of providing security will provide the [MISC Dutch  ] with political cover to make commitments post-2010 . 
Any sense the government is a patsy of the [LOC U.S.  ] or that [LOC Afghanistan  ] is descending into chaos will not garner the necessary public or parliamentary support. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S ) Comment Cont , d: The [MISC Dutch  ] see themselves as our partners in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and not mere supporters of [LOC U.S.  ] goals there . 
[LOC U.S.  ] engagement , from working level contacts to parliamentary and public outreach and high level contacts , will be necessary to confirm to the [MISC Dutch  ] they are a key partner with influence whose consultations are meaningful and have an impact . 
Our engagement must be discreet , sensitive and timely . 
During the run-up to the December 2007 decision to extend the [ORG Uruzgan  ] deployment an extra two years , the [MISC Qto  ] extend the [ORG Uruzgan  ] deployment an extra two years , the [MISC Dutch  ] did not want a heavy visible [ORG USG  ] presence and privately urged the [LOC U.S.  ] to " " trust us " " on getting the extension . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] will want quiet but active consultations and collaboration as a partner with the [LOC U.S.  ] We have suggested ( reftel C ) using important events for the [MISC NY400  ] celebration as a reason for high level visitors to come to the [LOC Netherlands  ] in 2009 , conduct public outreach and quietly engage [MISC Dutch  ] officials and parliamentarians on [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
At the outset , there will be two critical efforts - ensuring [ORG PvdA  ] support within the [ORG Cabinet  ] for any follow-on mission and getting additional parties , support once a [ORG Cabinet  ] plan is submitted to Parliament . 
End comment. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S ) Getting to [MISC Yes: Dutch  ] leaders will appreciate an understanding of both their domestic politics and their international contributions . 
Guidance from [LOC Washington  ] on the changing strategy in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , including growing deployments and expectations for Allies , will be essential . 
Post has already convened an [ORG Afghanistan Working Group  ] involving [ORG POL  ] , [ORG DAO  ] and PD to develop a game plan for engagement and monitor developments . 
Embassy The [ORG Hague  ] will continue to analyze and report on political developments in the [LOC Netherlands  ] and how those events affect prospects for the [MISC Dutch  ] post-2010 development . 
We will look for opportunities for [LOC Washington  ] leaders to engage [MISC Dutch  ] decision-makers ( e.g. , having the [ORG USNATO  ] ambassador as the guest of honor at [ORG Dutch-American Friendship Day  ] in April ; inviting General Petreaus to speak at the May 24 commemoration services at the [LOC Netherlands-U.S.  ] cemetery at [LOC Margraten  ] ; having Special Representative [PER Holbrooke  ] visit [ORG Uruzgan  ] and/or The [ORG Hague  ] as he reviews [LOC U.S.  ] strategy for [LOC Afghanistan  ] ; arranging an early meeting between Minister [PER Koenders  ] and the new USAID Administrator and senior Department officials on development issues ) . 
The upcoming meeting between the Secretary and FM [PER Verhagen  ] is an excellent opportunity to lay out what we want the [MISC Dutch  ] to do post-2010 and how we can help get them to that decision. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The following talking points will be a " " living document " " updated regularly for use with [MISC Dutch  ] officials: - WE VALUE OUR PARTNERSHIP: We are proud to be partners with the [MISC Dutch  ] in promoting a safe and secure [LOC Afghanistan  ] and know that you have consistently punched above your weight in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
( [ORG NOTE:  ] The [MISC Dutch  ] have been more involved in [LOC Afghanistan  ] than many in [ORG NATO  ] that have more capabilities . 
They were part of the initial ISAF forces and continue to contribute vitally important enablers . 
END NOTE . 
) - WE RECOGNIZE YOUR SACRIFICE: We are grateful for your work and recognize your sacrifices in extended command in the south and lead of [ORG Task Force Uruzgan  ] . 
We know your leadership has stretched your military capacity . 
( [ORG NOTE:  ] The [MISC Dutch  ] made a difficult political decision to retain the lead in [ORG Task Force Uruzgan  ] in 2007 and extended their commitment for two years as lead nation ; [ORG Dutch Major General  ] de [PER Kruif  ] is the Commander of [ORG Regional Command South  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have suffered 18 casualties in [LOC Uruzgan  ] , including the son of Chief of [ORG Defense General  ] van Uhm . 
It has been reported that as much as half of the military forces are either in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , preparing to go to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , or in a recovery mode from deployment at any one time . 
END NOTE . 
) - WE SHARE THE SAME GOALS FOR AFGHANISTAN: The President is committed to a 3D approach in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Your leadership in the use of development funds has been impressive in improving the lives of [MISC Afghan  ] citizens . 
( [ORG NOTE:  ] The [MISC Dutch  ] have long been advocates of the 3D approach and strongly push the development aspect in their efforts in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Kathleen Ferrier  ] , a skeptical [ORG CDA  ] MP , actually used the three words of democracy , defense and development to describe her view of what is needed in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
She and many in the [MISC Dutch  ] arena feel they actually initiated the concept . 
We can use this language to build [MISC Dutch  ] support . 
END NOTE . 
) - WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER ON THE CHALLENGES: As Vice President [PER Biden  ] said in his [ORG Wehrkunde  ] speech in [LOC Munich  ] , we are at a tenuous stage in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and we cannot afford Qare at a tenuous stage in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and we cannot afford to backslide . 
This makes every contribution from our Allies all the more important . 
Adding to the urgency of the situation are the upcoming Presidential elections in August ; we must all do everything in our power to head off potential violence if the [MISC Taliban  ] pull out all the stops to derail the process , as we expect them to do . 
With this in mind , we plan to significantly increase our efforts in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and urge Allies to join us in meeting the need for additional diplomacy , development and defense assets . 
We are planning on an extensive infusion of our forces as reinforcements , not replacements for current forces from all troop contributing nations already in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
( [ORG NOTE: Some  ] in the [LOC Netherlands  ] have begun to believe that with the significant additional [LOC U.S.  ] forces there is no longer a need for their own forces in theater . 
END NOTE . 
) - WE BELIEVE [MISC DUTCH  ] CONTRIBUTIONS ARE CRITICAL: [MISC Dutch  ] experience in running successful PRTs and the irreplaceable local knowledge you have gained in [ORG Uruzgan  ] are of crucial importance to ISAF . 
Additional [LOC U.S.  ] capabilities in the region may offer some relief to strained elements of your military , but we all need to continue to work together in [LOC Afghanistan  ] to give a coordinated 3D approach time to work .
