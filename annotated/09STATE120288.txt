( C ) [ORG Posts  ] should not leave any part of this message in writing with host governments . 
DEADLINE -------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) [ORG Posts  ] should report the results of their efforts by November 25 . 
[PER Elisa Catalano  ] ( NEA/FO , 202-647-9533 , CatalanoE@state.sgov.gov ) and [PER Richard Nephew  ] ( [ORG ISN/RA  ] , 202-647-7680 , NephewRM@state.sgov.gov ) are the Department 's POCs for this activity . 
BACKGROUND ---------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Since the 1 October 2009 meeting of the [ORG P5+1 Political Directors  ] and representatives from [LOC Iran  ] , the [LOC United States  ] has been working closely with its partners to fulfill the commitments reached in [LOC Geneva  ] and engage with [LOC Iran  ] to build international confidence in the peaceful nature of its nuclear program . 
In particular , we have focused on supporting the [ORG IAEA  ] 's proposal for refueling the [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] ( [ORG TRR  ] ) , facilitating the [ORG IAEA  ] 's inspection of the previously clandestine uranium enrichment plant at [LOC Qom  ] , and pressing for a follow-on meeting between [ORG P5+1 Political Directors  ] and [MISC Iranian  ] representatives explicitly on STATE 00120288 002 OF 008 [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The results since October 1 have been disappointing . 
It increasingly appears that [LOC Iran  ] will decline the [ORG IAEA  ] 's proposal on [ORG TRR  ] , though a definitive answer remains outstanding . 
In the lead-up to the [ORG IAEA Board of Governors  ] ( [ORG BOG  ] ) meeting on November 26 , [LOC Iran  ] may try to blame the apparent failure of the [ORG TRR  ] agreement on intrusive and inflexible demands by western powers , rather than its own reluctance or inability to reach agreement on the [ORG IAEA  ] proposal which responded to [LOC Iran  ] 's request for assistance and was created on the basis of [LOC Iran  ] 's own commitments made in [LOC Geneva  ] . 
Although [LOC Iran  ] granted [ORG IAEA  ] access to [LOC Qom  ] , [LOC Iran  ] did not cooperate with all of the [ORG IAEA  ] 's requests for access to information and personnel and there remain serious questions about [LOC Iran  ] 's intentions for the facility . 
Finally , [LOC Iran  ] so far has refused a further meeting with the [ORG P5+1  ] to discuss its nuclear program . 
The [LOC United States  ] is now discussing with its P5+1 and other partners potential next steps , including how to handle these issues at the next meeting of the [ORG IAEA  ] BOG. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG IAEA  ] Director General ( [ORG DG  ] ) [PER ElBaradei  ] released his latest report on [LOC Iran  ] on November 16 . 
The report makes clear [LOC Iran  ] 's continuing lack of transparency and cooperation with the [ORG IAEA  ] on its nuclear program , including in assessing a possible military dimension to its program . 
As expected , the uranium enrichment facility at [LOC Qom  ] ( also known as the [LOC Fordow  ] site ) was a central element of the report , and the [ORG IAEA  ] states that [LOC Iran  ] 's previous failure to declare the facility is " inconsistent " with its obligations under its Safeguards Agreement . 
The [ORG IAEA  ] 's report highlights that revelation of the [LOC Qom  ] facility raises concerns of additional clandestine nuclear sites in [LOC Iran  ] and has asked [LOC Iran  ] to confirm that there are no other undeclared nuclear facilities ; [LOC Iran  ] has yet to respond to this [ORG IAEA  ] request . 
[LOC Iran  ] continues to defy [ORG UNSC  ] resolutions and [ORG IAEA  ] BOG resolutions calling on it to adopt the Additional Protocol and to provide the access necessary for the [ORG IAEA  ] to provide assurance as to the absence of additional undeclared nuclear activities. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [ORG P5+1  ] " dual track " policy towards [LOC Iran  ] includes both engagement and pressure if [LOC Iran  ] does not engage constructively . 
President [PER Obama  ] , Secretary [PER Clinton  ] , and others have identified the end of the year as a key period for assessing [LOC Iran  ] 's responsiveness . 
If [LOC Iran  ] continues to refuse to take meaningful steps to meet its international obligations , the international community must be prepared to take strong collective action on the pressure track . 
KEY DIPLOMATIC MESSAGES AND POLICY NARRATIVE -------------------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) [ORG Posts  ] should draw on the following key messages and policy narrative in briefing host governments . 
Key Messages ------------ -- We , in coordination with our international partners , have demonstrated our willingness to engage constructively and respectfully with [LOC Iran  ] to address long-standing international concerns over its nuclear program . 
Our approach has clearly and consistently been based on the P5+1 's dual track strategy . 
-- [LOC Iran  ] so far has failed to accept a very good and balanced [ORG IAEA  ] proposal to facilitate the refueling of the [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] ( [ORG TRR  ] ) which would have fulfilled an [MISC Iranian  ] request , addressed a humanitarian need of the [MISC Iranian  ] people , and served as a confidence- building step to create an opportunity for further progress . 
-- We look forward to close consultations on how best to persuade [LOC Iran  ] to engage constructively as we approach the [ORG IAEA  ] 's [ORG Board of Governors  ] meeting on November 26 and beyond . 
Policy Narrative ---------------- -- Since President [PER Obama  ] took office , he has made clear the willingness of the [LOC United States  ] to engage with [LOC Iran  ] and to seek a new relationship based on mutual respect . 
-- He has authorized the United [MISC States'  ] full participation in diplomatic discussions between the five permanent members of the [ORG Security Council  ] and [LOC Germany  ] STATE 00120288 003 OF 008 and [LOC Iran  ] without pre-conditions . 
-- The [LOC United States  ] has stated its support for [LOC Iran  ] 's full right to a civilian nuclear program within [ORG IAEA  ] guidelines , provided [LOC Iran  ] meets it international obligations and carries out its responsibilities within the NPT framework . 
-- As a way to build confidence , the [LOC United States  ] , with [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC France  ] , has also supported the [ORG IAEA  ] 's proposal to positively respond to [LOC Iran  ] 's request for nuclear fuel for the [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] ( [ORG TRR  ] ) , in spite of [LOC Iran  ] 's continuing violation of [ORG UNSC  ] resolutions and noncompliance with [ORG IAEA  ] requirements on its nuclear program . 
-- However , almost one year into the [PER Obama  ] administration , [LOC Iran  ] has not taken practical , concrete steps that would begin to create confidence in its nuclear intentions . 
Iran: o Continues to enrich uranium despite [ORG UNSC  ] requirements that it suspend such operations ; o Revealed it had been building a secret uranium enrichment facility at a military base near [LOC Qom  ] , in violation of its safeguards agreement ; o Continues to refuse cooperation with the [ORG IAEA  ] in addressing the full range of [ORG IAEA  ] questions about the peaceful purposes of its nuclear program ; o Has not accepted the [ORG IAEA  ] proposal to refuel the [ORG TRR  ] ; and o Since meeting with representatives of the five permanent members of the [ORG Security Council  ] and [LOC Germany  ] in [LOC Geneva  ] on October 1 , has refused all subsequent efforts to schedule another meeting to discuss its nuclear program . 
-- [LOC Iran  ] 's failure to take advantage of these numerous opportunities raises serious questions about the intentions of its nuclear program that deserve urgent international attention . 
We look to work closely with your government in the run-up to [ORG IAEA Board of Governors  ] meeting on November 26 and beyond to develop an appropriate international response . 
[ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] ----------------------- -- The [ORG IAEA  ] , [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC France  ] and the [LOC United States  ] cooperated closely and flexibly to find a way to positively respond to [LOC Iran  ] 's request for fuel for the [ORG Tehran Research Reactor  ] ( [ORG TRR  ] ) so that it could keep running to meet humanitarian medical needs beyond 2010 . 
-- The [ORG TRR  ] refueling proposal offers [LOC Iran  ] the opportunity to convert its stockpile of low enriched uranium ( [ORG LEU  ] ) into higher-enriched fuel with the help of [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC France  ] . 
The proposal 's elements are simple: o [LOC Iran  ] would transfer a portion of its [ORG LEU  ] necessary for fuel production in one batch to [ORG IAEA  ] custody outside of [LOC Iran  ] before the end of the year ; o [LOC Russia  ] would further enrich the [ORG LEU  ] to meet fuel requirements ; and o [LOC France  ] would fabricate the fuel assemblies and return them to [LOC Iran  ] before [LOC Iran  ] 's fuel supplies are depleted before the end of the year . 
-- In addition the [LOC United States  ] expressed a commitment to work with the [ORG IAEA  ] to improve safety and control features at the [ORG TRR  ] . 
-- The [LOC U.S.  ] , [LOC France  ] and [LOC Russia  ] took great risks in supporting the deal , especially in light of [LOC Iran  ] 's continuing violation of successive [ORG UNSC  ] resolutions and [ORG IAEA  ] requirements , including its secret construction of a uranium enrichment facility near [LOC Qom  ] , and its continuing enrichment operations . 
-- We did so because the arrangement would begin to build confidence and would give [LOC Iran  ] and the international community more time to reach a comprehensive negotiated solution to [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program , while fulfilling [LOC Iran  ] 's humanitarian needs . 
-- When [LOC Iran  ] expressed concern about the reliability of the proposal , the [LOC United States  ] and its partners expressed to the [ORG IAEA  ] a willingness to address [LOC Iran  ] 's concerns , including through: o a [LOC U.S.  ] offer to formally join the deal as a signatory ; STATE 00120288 004 OF 008 o a readiness of the five permanent members of the [ORG Security Council  ] and [LOC Germany  ] to guarantee the deal through a political statement of support ; o a willingness to help secure finance for the movement of the [ORG LEU  ] and fuel ; o an openness to move the [ORG LEU  ] to any number of locations outside of [LOC Iran  ] ; and o a willingness to support the [ORG IAEA  ] 's holding material equivalent to the fuel in escrow in a third country as a guarantee for [LOC Iran  ] of the fuel 's ultimate delivery . 
-- After reaching an agreement in principle in the deal following talks with the [LOC E3+3  ] in [LOC Geneva  ] on October 1 , and following further technical discussions at the [ORG IAEA  ] October 19-21 , [LOC Iran  ] has so far failed to accept the deal . 
-- This raises a question about [LOC Iran  ] 's intentions . 
If [LOC Iran  ] is enriching uranium to meet its civilian reactor fuel needs , why would it not accept an international offer ( with significant guarantees ) to provide its [ORG LEU  ] for fuel to power the [ORG TRR  ] to meet its humanitarian needs , particularly when it does not have the capability to produce the fuel on its own ? 
-- This question is troubling in the context of [LOC Iran  ] 's continued enrichment activities in defiance of [ORG UNSC  ] resolutions ; its secret construction of an enrichment facility on a military base near [LOC Qom  ] ; its refusal to cooperate with the [ORG IAEA  ] in answering questions about the peaceful nature of its nuclear program ; and its refusal to meet with the five permanent members of the [ORG Security Council  ] . 
[MISC P5+1  ] ---- -- Together with our [MISC P5+1  ] partners , the [LOC United States  ] informed [MISC Iranian  ] representatives in [LOC Geneva  ] on October 1 of our willingness to discuss any items of concern to [LOC Iran  ] - both bilaterally and multilaterally - in addition to our concerns about [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program . 
-- On October 1 , [LOC Iran  ] 's representatives committed to meet again before the end of the month based on an agenda that included [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program . 
Since that time , however , the [MISC Iranian  ] government has refused all invitations to meet if its nuclear program would be on the agenda . 
-- [LOC Iran  ] 's continued refusal to engage on its nuclear program with the [MISC P5+1  ] deepens our concerns about [LOC Iran  ] 's intentions for its nuclear program . 
The [ORG IAEA  ] Director General 's Report on [LOC Iran  ] ------------------------------------------ -- The [ORG IAEA  ] report makes clear that [LOC Iran  ] has failed to cooperate fully and transparently with the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
Key aspects of the report include: ---- [LOC Iran  ] 's new centrifuge facility at [LOC Qom  ] - built in violation of [LOC Iran  ] 's [ORG UNSC  ] obligations and not declared to the [ORG IAEA  ] as required - has been inspected , but its purpose and origin remain unknown . 
And , [LOC Iran  ] has not yet cooperated with all of the [ORG IAEA  ] 's requests for access to information and personnel . 
[LOC Iran  ] 's failure to provide the [ORG IAEA  ] with early design information regarding the [LOC Qom  ] facility has been deemed " inconsistent with its obligations under the [ORG Subsidiary Arrangements  ] to its Safeguards Agreement " by the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
Furthermore , the relatively small size of the facility at [LOC Qom  ] is inconsistent with [LOC Iran  ] 's assertion that it is to provide fuel for [LOC Iran  ] 's civilian reactors , raising questions about the planned use of the [LOC Qom  ] facility. ---- The [PER Agency  ] noted that [LOC Iran  ] 's failure to declare the [LOC Qom  ] facility also " reduces the level of confidence in the absence of other nuclear facilities under construction and gives rise to questions about whether there were any other nuclear facilities in [LOC Iran  ] that had not been declared to the [PER Agency  ] . 
" ---- These concerns have been compounded by the continued pace of [MISC Iranian  ] enrichment and steadfast refusal to abide by the [ORG UNSC  ] 's legal requirement that [LOC Iran  ] suspend all such work . 
Instead , [LOC Iran  ] continues to produce low enriched uranium and estimated its stockpile at 1763 kilograms at the end of October . 
Notwithstanding a reduction in the number of enriching centrifuges by approximately 600 since August 2009 , this is roughly a similar rate of production as [LOC Iran  ] has STATE 00120288 005 OF 008 achieved for the past year. ---- [LOC Iran  ] continues to install and test additional centrifuges , with more than 1,000 new centrifuges added since August 2009. ---- The [ORG IAEA  ] has discovered a previously unknown cache of heavy water in storage at [LOC Esfahan  ] , and has requested [LOC Iran  ] to explain its origin . 
It is important to note that [ORG UN Security Council  ] resolutions include a ban on supplying [LOC Iran  ] with heavy water. ---- It also asked [LOC Iran  ] to provide further information describing an analytical laboratory that [LOC Iran  ] says it plans to install underground at [LOC Esfahan.  ] ---- There has been no progress made in addressing issues associated with [LOC Iran  ] 's efforts to develop a nuclear warhead , despite a year having passed since the last such conversation and many open questions that surround this work . 
-- If [LOC Iran  ] wishes to begin to resolve international concerns , it should comply with its international obligations , cooperate fully with the [ORG IAEA  ] , grant the access requested ( such as to individuals and workshops associated with past weaponization efforts , and to individuals responsible for managing [LOC Qom  ] ) , and answer the questions it has been asked . 
[LOC Iran  ] has created this confidence deficit and it is up to [LOC Iran  ] to restore the international community 's trust . 
Next Steps ---------- -- The [LOC United States  ] and its partners believe that the troubling questions surrounding [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program deserve the full and urgent attention of the international community . 
-- We look forward to working with your government to promote the active involvement of the [ORG IAEA  ] and the international community in addressing these unresolved questions . 
-- We will be in touch with you in the days ahead to share ideas on how to approach the issue at the [ORG IAEA Board of Governors  ] meeting that will begin on November <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
-- Beyond the [ORG Board of Governors  ] meeting , we would also like to intensify our consultations on next appropriate steps in the international community based on the dual track policy ( engagement and pressure ) to persuade [LOC Iran  ] to bring its nuclear program into full compliance with its international obligations . 
HARD QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS -------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( U ) We have also compiled the following questions and answers to draw from should Posts require them: On The [MISC TRR Proposal  ] ------------------- -- Why must [LOC Iran  ] surrender all of its [ORG LEU  ] in one batch , and why must it be before the end of the year ? o The [ORG TRR  ] proposal was developed both to supply [LOC Iran  ] with the fuel required for the continued operation of the reactor , and also as a measure to build confidence in [LOC Iran  ] 's peaceful intentions and its seriousness to negotiate with the [LOC E3+3.  ] o By agreeing to the transfer of 1200 kilograms of [ORG LEU  ] ( enough to equal the last fuel supply agreement [LOC Iran  ] signed for the reactor with [LOC Argentina  ] in the early 1990s ) , we aimed to lessen international concerns that [LOC Iran  ] was attempting to create a stockpile of uranium to contribute to an eventual breakout from the [ORG NPT  ] . 
This would consequently allow more time for negotiations with the [MISC E3+3  ] on the broader nuclear file. o The transfer by the end of the year is needed to ensure that [LOC Iran  ] receives the fuel required for the reactor before December 2010 , when the reactor will run out and be forced to shut down . 
-- What risk does the [ORG LEU  ] stored in [LOC Iran  ] pose to the international community ? 
Isn't it under full [ORG IAEA  ] monitoring ? o Yes , this [ORG LEU  ] is currently under [ORG IAEA  ] safeguards . 
STATE 00120288 006 OF 008 o However , given [LOC Iran  ] 's long history of [ORG IAEA  ] safeguards violations and [ORG NPT  ] noncompliance , the international community cannot trust that [LOC Iran  ] will not interfere with [ORG IAEA  ] monitoring or withdraw from [ORG IAEA  ] safeguards or the [ORG NPT  ] altogether. o This project will remove an immediate source of concern and establish some confidence in [LOC Iran  ] 's peaceful intent and willingness to comply with its obligations . 
-- How can [LOC Iran  ] be sure it will ever receive the fuel assemblies for the [ORG TRR  ] in the current international environment , in which many openly seek to diminish [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear capacity ? o We and our [MISC E3+3  ] partners have each made political commitments at the highest levels to the fulfillment of this project . 
Should [LOC Iran  ] agree to it , [LOC Iran  ] will receive the fuel required. o All participants in this project are taking risks . 
[LOC Iran  ] stands in violation of the [ORG NPT  ] , its [ORG IAEA  ] safeguards agreement , and three [ORG Chapter VII UNSC  ] resolutions . 
This project offers [LOC Iran  ] an opportunity to establish confidence in its peaceful intentions , a confidence that has eroded due to [LOC Iran  ] 's continued non-compliance . 
-- Can [LOC Iran  ] simply purchase the fuel from an international supplier , as some have advocated in [LOC Iran  ] ? o The [ORG UN Security Council  ] resolutions do permit [LOC Iran  ] to [LOC Iran  ] can purchase low-enriched fuel from an international supplier if it wishes. o However , we are confident [LOC Iran  ] would not find a willing supplier given the concerns surrounding its nuclear program and its continued defiance of the international community. o Outside of the context of the [ORG IAEA  ] proposal before [LOC Iran  ] , we would oppose such a deal . 
-- How would the [MISC E3+3  ] respond if [LOC Iran  ] announced it had " no choice " but to make its own fuel for the [ORG TRR  ] ? o Under three [ORG UN Security Council  ] resolutions , [LOC Iran  ] is required to suspend all uranium enrichment- related activities . 
We have offered [LOC Iran  ] a way to secure the necessary [ORG TRR  ] fuel without further violating these obligations . 
Enrichment activities to produce its own fuel for the [ORG TRR  ] would be a violation of current [MISC UNSCRs.  ] o Further , [LOC Iran  ] is not currently able to produce the fuel . 
Reconfiguration of [MISC Iranian  ] centrifuges to produce the required enrichment level ( 19.75% ) would cause serious international concern and could permit [LOC Iran  ] to produce a stockpile of even greater enriched uranium than it has currently ( [LOC Iran  ] 's current enrichment level is 3.5% ) . 
This would increase the risk of a near-term [MISC Iranian  ] breakout from the [ORG NPT  ] and sprint to producing nuclear weapons . 
On Demands to Suspend Enrichment -------------------------------- -- [LOC Iran  ] suspended enrichment once before in response to international demands , and received no benefit . 
Why should [LOC Iran  ] trust the international community now ? o [LOC Iran  ] 's suspension of uranium enrichment and other activities in the past was intended to support a diplomatic process . 
Unfortunately , [LOC Iran  ] terminated that diplomatic process in August 2005 by abandoning suspension. o However , prior to that point , [LOC Iran  ] 's temporary suspension avoided its being reported to the [ORG UN Security Council  ] and the sanctions that would have likely come along with that report. o The requirement of suspension imposed by the [ORG UNSC  ] in resolution 1737 is intended to restore that diplomatic process and to lead to a final resolution of international concerns with [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program. o This was codified in [LOC UNSCR  ] 1737 when the [ORG UNSC  ] stated its intention to suspend implementation of the measures adopted by the [ORG UNSC  ] if [LOC Iran  ] returned to negotiations through suspension of its nuclear and related activities. o Trust is in short supply on both sides . 
It is for that reason that we have offered [LOC Iran  ] several opportunities for reciprocal , confidence-building steps ( e.g. , " freeze for freeze " and the [ORG TRR  ] proposal ) . 
-- What about recent reports indicating the [MISC Iranian  ] STATE 00120288 007 OF 008 enrichment program has not grown . 
What is the significance of this stagnation ? o [LOC Iran  ] has slowed or scaled back the enrichment program several times since the project became public in 2002. o There are many possible explanations for the stagnation of the [MISC Iranian  ] enrichment program , including technical issues with the centrifuges and general system maintenance. o Regardless of [LOC Iran  ] 's lack of progress in its enrichment program , it continues to enrich and stockpile [ORG LEU  ] . 
This activity in violation of three [ORG United Nations Security Council  ] resolutions calling for full suspension of its nuclear and enrichment related activities , and increases the risk of a near-term [MISC Iranian  ] breakout from the [ORG NPT  ] and sprint to producing nuclear weapons . 
[LOC Israel  ] 's [ORG Nuclear Program  ] ------------------------ -- Why is there not equal attention to [LOC Israel  ] 's nuclear status ? 
Does it not also destabilize the region ? o The [LOC United States  ] has long supported universal adherence to the [ORG NPT  ] treaty and continues to believe that all states that have not done so should join the Treaty and accept the full-scope [ORG IAEA  ] safeguards on all of their nuclear activities. o It is extremely difficult , however , to make this case to a non-NPT state when its neighbors are in violation of their own [ORG NPT  ] obligations , and when the international community has not demonstrated the political will necessary to enforce compliance. o [LOC Iran  ] 's failure to comply with its [ORG NPT  ] and [ORG IAEA  ] obligations bears out these concerns and undermines attempts to secure universal adherence to the [ORG NPT  ] . 
It became a party to the treaty and proceeded to violate its obligations under it for over twenty years , presenting a fundamental threat to the entire nonproliferation regime. o Returning regional states to full compliance with their [ORG NPT  ] obligations would be an important step toward [ORG NPT  ] adherence by all states in the region . 
An [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear weapons capability also serves as a destabilizing factor in the region , possibly triggering proliferation across the [LOC Gulf  ] in response to a mounting threat posed by [LOC Iran  ] . 
Not only does this undermine the entire nuclear nonproliferation regime , but risks further instability in the region . 
[ORG Qom Facility  ] ------------ -- How can you say that the [LOC Qom  ] facility was secret , when it was [LOC Iran  ] that announced its existence and invited [ORG IAEA  ] inspectors to visit ? o [LOC Iran  ] was required to declare the existence of this facility to the [ORG IAEA  ] the moment the decision was made to construct it , not several years into its construction . 
This is a requirement of [LOC Iran  ] 's [ORG IAEA Safeguards Agreement  ] ( contained in Code 3.1 of the [ORG Subsidiary Arrangement to Iran  ] 's [ORG Safeguards Agreement  ] ) . o This code was modified after revelations surrounding [LOC Iraq  ] 's nuclear program were made in the early 1990s. o [LOC Iran  ] was the last state to agree to the revised code , but it did so in March 2003 . 
[LOC Iran  ] attempted to revert to the early form of the code ( which requires notification only 180 days prior to the introduction of nuclear to the facility ) in March 2007 . 
The [ORG IAEA  ] consistently has rejected that [LOC Iran  ] has the legal ability to make such a change. o We also believe that [LOC Iran  ] made the decision to declare the facility not to conform to its legal obligations , but because it had become aware that the secrecy of the facility had been compromised . 
-- [LOC Iran  ] claims it needs such a hardened facility as Fordu because for years both the [LOC US  ] and [LOC Israel  ] have threatened to bomb its nuclear sites . 
Is it not surprising [LOC Iran  ] would try to keep its location a secret to have an emergency back-up facility ? 
O [LOC Iran  ] 's own failure to meet its obligations for transparency and [ORG IAEA  ] monitoring of sensitive nuclear installations is the cause for the STATE 00120288 008 OF 008 international community 's concerns that surrounding its nuclear program. o [LOC Iran  ] 's decision to construct yet another clandestine site only deepens these concerns . 
P5+1 ---- -- Why should [LOC Iran  ] discuss its nuclear program with the self-appointed P5+1 ? 
Isn't the [ORG IAEA  ] the proper place for [LOC Iran  ] to engage on its nuclear program with the international community ? 
O We welcome [LOC Iran  ] 's engagement with the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
But despite its rhetoric , [LOC Iran  ] has not engaged with the [ORG IAEA  ] . 
[LOC Iran  ] has refused for several years to answer the [ORG IAEA  ] 's questions ( even before the [ORG IAEA  ] reported [LOC Iran  ] to the [ORG UNSC  ] for its myriad violations of its international obligations ) . o The [MISC E3+3  ] mechanism evolved as a means to negotiate a solution precisely because [LOC Iran  ] was refusing to engage with the [ORG IAEA  ] on the concerns regarding [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program .
