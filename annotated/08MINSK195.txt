Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Poloff met March 14 with [PER Yakov Basin  ] , a [MISC Jewish  ] community leader , to discuss an anti-Semitic threat letter sent by the [LOC Vitebsk  ] cell of the neo-Nazi [ORG Russian National Unity  ] ( [ORG RNE  ] ) group to the editor of a regional independent daily in January . 
[PER Basin  ] stated that the editor had filed the case with the regional prosecutor 's office . 
The regional prosecutor together with police decided not to open a felony investigation in the matter . 
The case is now in the hands of the local [ORG BKGB  ] , which , in [PER Basin  ] 's opinion , has strong ties to the neo-Nazi group and is doubtful to investigate further . 
End summary . 
Authorities Ignoring the Case ----------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The editor-in-chief of the regional independent daily " Courier from [LOC Vitebsk  ] " [PER Vladimir Bazan  ] and independent media distributor [PER Boris Khomayda  ] received a threatening letter January 9 from the [MISC Neo-Nazi  ] group [ORG Russian National Unity  ] ( [ORG RNE  ] ) ( reftel ) . 
In the letter , [ORG RNE  ] members threatened to disrupt newspaper distribution and to use their ties to government circles to punish [PER Bazan  ] and [PER Khomayda  ] if the newspaper did not publish an article condemning a planned Holocaust memorial in [LOC Vitebsk  ] . 
( [PER Note: Bazan  ] had received a similar threat in August 2006 . 
End note . 
) <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Poloff discussed the case with [PER Yakov Basin  ] , chairman of the [ORG Religious Association of Progressive Jewish Communities  ] . 
According to [PER Basin  ] , [PER Bazan  ] and [PER Khomayda  ] filed a complaint with the [ORG Vitebsk Regional Prosecutor  ] 's office , which passed the case to the local police . 
Following a pro-forma investigation in which they determined the letter represented at most a misdemeanor , the police passed the case to the [ORG BKGB  ] , where , according to [PER Basin  ] , the investigation has stalled. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Authorities refused to investigate threats from [ORG RNE  ] in 2006 , explaining that the group is unregistered , and therefore it is impossible to track down the organizers of the group . 
[PER Basin  ] asserts that the [ORG BKGB  ] supports the [ORG RNE  ] financially and is using the organization to promote " its pro-Russia agenda " in [LOC Belarus  ] . 
Therefore , the fact that the case has been passed to the [ORG BKGB  ] is an indication of the [ORG GOB  ] 's tacit support for the [ORG RNE  ] , according to [PER Basin  ] . 
Comment ------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Though post does not have proof that the [ORG BKGB  ] controls or is in any way officially affiliated with [ORG Russian National Unity  ] , it is clear that the [ORG GOB  ] tolerates the neo-Nazi group and has no intention of investigating its anti-Semitic activities . 
The [ORG GOB  ] 's double standard for investigating unregistered groups is also clear ; authorities assert that it is impossible to crack down on [ORG RNE  ] because it is unregistered , yet use state mechanisms to oppress unregistered pro-democracy groups such as [ORG Malady Front  ] .
