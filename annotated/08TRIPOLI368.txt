( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: A recent drilling accident brought drilling and production operations in an offshore wellfield operated by [MISC French  ] oil company [ORG TOTAL  ] to a halt . 
Although there were no injuries or environmental damage , production ( the field produces about 45,000 barrels/day ) will likely be halted for several months until the wells can be repaired . 
Even if [ORG TOTAL  ] subsequently surges production to recoup its losses , it will take several years to make up the lost production . 
End Summary . 
DRILLING ACCIDENT 2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In September 2003 , [MISC French  ] oil giant [ORG TOTAL  ] started production in [LOC Libya  ] 's [MISC Al Jurf  ] field , located about 100 kilometers offshore in water averaging 90 meters in depth . 
The field consists of a platform with ten production wells connected to a floating production storage offloading ( [ORG FPSO  ] ) vessel located roughly 3km from the producing platform . 
[ORG Total  ] operates the block with a 37.5% interest ( via its local operating company , [ORG Mabruk Oil Operations  ] ) and is partnered with [MISC German  ] oil company [ORG Wintershall  ] ( 12.5% interest ) and [LOC Libya  ] 's [ORG National Oil Corporation  ] ( 50% interest ) . 
3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A drilling accident occurred at the field on April 17 , during work on a development well for gas injection . 
According to [ORG TOTAL  ] 's Health , Safety and Environment ( [ORG HSE  ] ) manager , the drill went off-course and penetrated an adjacent production well at a depth of 650 feet beneath the seabed . 
Due in part to the safety precautions taken before the commencement of drilling , including the shut-down of all production wells , there was no oil spillage or injuries as a result of the accident . 
The entire platform was evacuated within 48 hours as an additional safety precaution against a well blowout , and production was suspended indefinitely in all ten wells in the field . 
OFFLINE FOR MONTHS...AT GREAT COST 4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG TOTAL  ] 's locally-based emergency team was activated to secure the platform , and a specialized ten-member technical team has been flown in from [LOC France  ] to assess the damage and recommend a course of repairs . 
Given the extent of the damage , the early assessment from the team is that the entire field will remain offline for at least two months . 
That best case scenario involves making repairs from the platform itself , rather than from a relief well , which would have to be drilled alongside the damaged one . 
If it becomes necessary to drill a relief well , the cost and timeline of needed repairs could expand considerably . 
5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Al Jurf  ] field is fairly large field , producing an average of 45,000 barrels/day . 
( Note: For sake of comparison , that is roughly the daily crude oil production of [LOC Turkey  ] . 
End Note ) . 
Loss of production for several months will make a significant dent in [ORG TOTAL  ] 's bottom line in [LOC Libya  ] , and the [ORG NOC  ] will likely seek compensation for the shortfall in their projected revenues . 
[ORG TOTAL  ] 's [ORG HSE  ] manager noted that once production is resumed , it could be surged to 52,000 barrels/day or more to compensate for the loss of production for several months . 
Even at that rate , the gap would only be closed after a couple of years of uninterrupted production at the higher level . 
6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: Although [ORG TOTAL  ] has ably handled the aftermath , this is a major accident and a blot on its record in [LOC Libya  ] . 
Insurance will likely cover [ORG TOTAL  ] for its losses in the short term and the continuing technical investigation may determine that repairs can be completed quickly ; however , the tight market for offshore drilling ships could be a factor if it is determined that a relief well must be drilled to complete needed repairs .
