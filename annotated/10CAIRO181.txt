( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Key Points: -- Since your last visit , the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Egypt  ] initiated a senior-level [ORG Strategic Dialogue  ] that built upon the improved bilateral atmosphere following President [PER Obama  ] 's June 2009 speech in [LOC Cairo  ] . 
We have seen improved cooperation in multilateral fora , in addition to close cooperation on regional issues including [MISC Arab-Israeli  ] peace and [LOC Sudan  ] . 
-- While the [MISC U.S.-Egypt  ] military relationship remains strong , the [MISC Egyptian  ] military has been resistant to our efforts to adjust its focus to reflect new regional and transnational threats . 
-- While [MISC Egyptian  ] leadership continues to view [LOC Iran  ] as the greatest strategic threat to the [LOC Middle East  ] , the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] conflict and [MISC Sudanese  ] instability are immediate concerns for [LOC Egypt  ] . 
-- [LOC Egypt  ] has increased counter smuggling efforts , including the construction of a subterranean steel wall along the [MISC Egypt-Gaza  ] border that has provoked intense domestic and regional criticism of perceived complicity in the [MISC Israeli  ] blockade of [ORG Gaza.  ] ---------------------------- [ORG Renewed Cooperation  ] ---------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Admiral Mullen  ] , welcome back to [LOC Egypt  ] . 
Building upon the optimism generated by a new [LOC U.S.  ] administration and President [PER Obama  ] 's well-received June 4 speech in [LOC Cairo  ] , we resumed in June our [MISC Strategic Dialogue  ] and set in place a new framework for regular bilateral meetings with the [MISC Egyptians  ] to explore areas for cooperation and coordination , including examining our respective assessments of strategic threats such as [LOC Iran  ] . 
The most recent meeting was hosted by Under Secretary Burns in December in [LOC Washington  ] . 
We are exploring other ways to translate this sense of goodwill into concrete action , including a renewed focus in our bilateral assistance programs on human capacity development and strengthening [LOC Egypt  ] 's ability to compete in education , science , and technology. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Our goal remains to widen our military cooperation discussion beyond the annual flow of [ORG Foreign Military Financing  ] ( [ORG FMF  ] ) . 
At the end of 2009 , we conducted our two premier bilateral military events - the annual [ORG Military Cooperation Committee  ] ( [ORG MCC  ] ) meeting and the [ORG Bright Star  ] military exercise . 
During the [ORG MCC  ] , [LOC Egypt  ] agreed to implement specific measures to improve their ability to protect [LOC U.S.  ] technology . 
During [ORG Bright Star  ] , the [MISC Egyptians  ] canceled several joint-operations that would have broadened the exercise 's scope . 
We are working hard to ensure that [ORG Bright Star  ] 2011 will involve full-spectrum operations . 
[PER Tantawi  ] and his senior leaders recognize and appreciate increased engagement with the [LOC U.S.  ] military , which provides us an opportunity to highlight for them the need to sharpen and focus the [MISC Egyptian  ] military 's mission to reflect new regional threats . 
[LOC Egypt  ] 's offer to train [MISC Iraqi  ] and [MISC Afghan  ] military officials provides an opportunity for the [MISC Egyptian  ] military to play a greater role in supporting regional security . 
[LOC Egypt  ] also has plans to significantly increase its peace-keeping presence in [LOC Africa  ] , including a new deployment to the [LOC Democratic Republic  ] of the [LOC Congo  ] , and we hope to support their efforts through [LOC Egypt  ] 's inclusion in the [MISC Global Peace Operations Initiative  ] . 
We have requested meetings for you with President [PER Mubarak  ] , [ORG MinDef Field Marshall Tantawi  ] , CoS [PER LTG Anan  ] , and EGIS Chief MGen ( ret ) [ORG Soliman.  ] --------------------- [ORG Regional Security  ] --------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) President [PER Mubarak  ] sees [LOC Iran  ] as [LOC Egypt  ] 's -- and the region 's -- primary strategic threat . 
[LOC Egypt  ] 's already dangerous neighborhood , he believes , has only become more so since the fall of [ORG Saddam  ] , who , as nasty as he was , nevertheless stood as a wall against [LOC Iran  ] . 
He now sees [LOC Tehran  ] 's hand moving with ease throughout the region , " from the [LOC Gulf  ] to [LOC Morocco  ] . 
" The immediate threat to [LOC Egypt  ] comes from [MISC Iranian  ] conspiracies with [ORG Hamas  ] ( which he sees as the " brother " of his own most dangerous internal political threat , the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] ) to stir up unrest in [LOC Gaza  ] , but he is also concerned about [MISC Iranian  ] machinations in [LOC Sudan  ] and their efforts to create havoc elsewhere in the region , including in [LOC Yemen  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] , and even the [MISC Sinai  ] , via [ORG Hezbollah  ] . 
While [LOC Tehran  ] 's nuclear threat is also a cause for concern , [PER Mubarak  ] is more urgently seized with what he sees as the rise of [MISC Iranian  ] surrogates ( [ORG Hamas  ] and [ORG Hezbollah  ] ) and [MISC Iranian  ] attempts to dominate the [LOC Middle East.  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) The [MISC Egyptians  ] have stepped up their cooperation with the [MISC Iraqis  ] considerably , primarily through establishment of a " joint committee " which covers the full range of economic , social , military and political bilateral development . 
In November 2009 , the [MISC Egyptians  ] returned an ambassador to [LOC Baghdad  ] . 
MOD is also requesting USG approval to sell [LOC Iraq  ] 140 M1A1 tanks manufactured in [LOC Egypt  ] under a co-production agreement . 
On [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the [ORG GOE  ] has agreed to explore expanding its scope and breadth of programs there , including in the areas of education , women 's empowerment and communications . 
[LOC Egypt  ] has operated a military field hospital at [LOC Bagram  ] since 2003 with approximately 60 personnel. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC Egypt  ] 's top priority in [LOC Africa  ] is the future of [LOC Sudan  ] . 
The [ORG GOE  ] would like to maintain [MISC Sudanese  ] unity because it believes a break-up will increase refugee flows into [LOC Egypt  ] and threaten [LOC Egypt  ] 's access to [LOC Nile  ] waters . 
However , the [ORG GOE  ] is hedging its bets by providing [LOC South Sudan  ] with development assistance including building and staffing medical clinics , helping to clear aquatic plants from the [LOC White Nile  ] and building power stations and a university . 
[LOC Egypt  ] is the fifth-largest peace keeping contributor in the world , with the majority of its troops deployed to southern [LOC Sudan  ] and [LOC Darfur  ] . 
They have also agreed to deploy a large contingent to the [LOC Democratic Republic  ] of the [LOC Congo.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC Egypt  ] continues to support our efforts to resume negotiations between the [MISC Israelis  ] and [MISC Palestinians  ] and maintains a regular dialogue with all sides . 
[MISC Egyptian  ] sponsored negotiations on [MISC Palestinian  ] reconciliation are ongoing . 
[LOC Egypt  ] 's objectives are to avoid another [LOC Gaza  ] crisis while eroding Hamas' power and ultimately returning the [ORG Palestinian Authority  ] to [ORG Gaza.  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- [ORG Mil-Mil Cooperation: Counter Smuggling  ] --------------------------------------------- ----- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) President [PER Mubarak  ] and military leaders view our military assistance program as a cornerstone of our mil-mil relationship and consider the USD 1.3 billion in annual [ORG FMF  ] as untouchable compensation for making peace with [LOC Israel  ] . 
Decision-making within MOD rests almost solely with Defense Minister [PER Tantawi  ] . 
In office since 1991 , he consistently resists change to the level and direction of [ORG FMF  ] funding and is therefore one of our chief impediments to transforming our security relationship . 
Nevertheless , he retains President [PER Mubarak  ] 's support . 
You should encourage [PER Tantawi  ] to place greater emphasis on countering asymmetric threats rather than focusing almost exclusively on conventional force. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [LOC Egypt  ] continues to use a wide range of military , security , intelligence , and diplomatic efforts to combat the flow of arms to [LOC Gaza  ] . 
The effectiveness of these efforts is difficult to assess , and our visibility into these programs is limited . 
However , [LOC Egypt  ] has reported success in identifying and intercepting arms smuggling networks from [LOC Sudan  ] to [LOC Cairo  ] , as well as interdicting illicit funds destined for [LOC Gaza  ] . 
[MISC Israeli  ] officials have also reported some satisfaction with increased [MISC Egyptian  ] efforts . 
MOD is also participating in a USG-financed project - led by EGIS - to install 15 x-ray scanners along the vehicular entrances to the [MISC Sinai  ] to search for arms and explosives. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Tantawi  ] continues to resist [LOC U.S.  ] offers of additional counter smuggling assistance . 
Sovereignty concerns are likely driving his hesitation , along with concerns that [ORG FMF  ] funds may be directed away from more high-profile programs like M1A1 tanks and aircraft . 
You should encourage [PER Tantawi  ] to focus more [LOC U.S.  ] assistance on border security , especially along the remote [MISC Egypt-Sudan  ] border . 
You should also remind [PER Tantawi  ] that no single technology can stop smuggling . 
Success will depend on how well [LOC Egypt  ] uses all available tools and resources to identity and disrupt smuggling networks . 
He will likely reply that BTADS - currently on-hold because of security concerns - and the subterranean steel wall MOD has begun to install along the [MISC Egypt-Gaza  ] border , will provide a sufficient counter-smuggling capability. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Tantawi  ] will likely express concerns over releasability issues and frustration with [LOC Egypt  ] 's inability to procure restricted weapons systems . 
However , concerns over [LOC Egypt  ] 's end-use performance , especially in [ORG Congress  ] , continue . 
You should stress that decisions to release advanced weapons systems are made on a country-by-country basis , but continued cooperation to improve [LOC Egypt  ] 's protection of [MISC American  ] technology and signing a [ORG CISMOA  ] would be welcome steps in our dialogue on releasability. -------------------------------------- Internal Politics and Economics -------------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) We continue to promote democratic reform in [LOC Egypt  ] , including the expansion of political freedom and pluralism , and respect for human rights . 
While [LOC Egypt  ] has made some limited gains over the last several years , such as on freedom of the press , progress overall has been slow . 
We continue to press the [ORG GOE  ] to replace the [ORG State of Emergency  ] , in place almost continuously since 1967 , with counterterrorism legislation that protects civil liberties . 
Designed to target violent [MISC Islamist  ] extremist groups , the [ORG GOE  ] has also used the [ORG Emergency Law  ] to target political activity by the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] , bloggers and labor demonstrators . 
The [ORG Interior Ministry  ] suppresses political opposition through arrests , harassment and intimidation. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) The [ORG GoE  ] remains skeptical of our role in democracy promotion , arguing that any efforts to open up will result in empowering the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] , which currently holds 86 seats -- as independents -- in [LOC Egypt  ] 's 454-seat parliament . 
Elections for the upper house of the parliament , or the [ORG Shura Council  ] , are to be held in June 2010 and elections for the lower house of parliament or the [ORG People 's Assembly  ] are now scheduled for October <a id='par2010' href='#par2010'>¶</a>2010 . 
Presidential elections will be held in 2011 . 
It is still unclear whether President [PER Mubarak  ] , in power for over 25 years , will decide to run again . 
Some believe that he is grooming his son , [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] , to succeed him as President. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Economic reform is ongoing although [LOC Egypt  ] still suffers from widespread poverty affecting 35-40% of the population . 
[MISC Egyptian-U.S.  ] trade more than doubled between 2005 and 2008 , before slumping in 2009 amidst the global economic crisis . 
Bilateral trade volume was roughly $7.5 billion in 2009 , and the [LOC U.S.  ] exports to [LOC Egypt  ] more than twice as much as it imports . 
[MISC Egyptian  ] banks operate very conservatively and have been spared involvement in risky financial products , but the effects of the global economic crisis on [LOC Egypt  ] are beginning to be felt . 
As the global credit crunch worsens , [LOC Egypt  ] remains vulnerable as exports , [LOC Suez Canal  ] revenues , tourism , and remittances - its largest sources of revenue -- are all down and will likely to continue to fall .
