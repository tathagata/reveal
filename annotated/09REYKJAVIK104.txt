( U ) Emboff met with [LOC Iceland  ] 's Commissioner to the [ORG International Whaling Commission  ] ( [ORG IWC  ] ) [PER Tomas Heidar  ] and Director of the [ORG Ministry for Foreign Affairs' Natural Resources and Environmental Affairs Department  ] Jon [PER Egill Egilsson  ] on June 9 to relay reftel points and elicit [LOC Iceland  ] 's priorities for the annual [ORG IWC  ] meeting in [LOC Portugal  ] . 
[LOC Iceland  ] 's responses are keyed to reftel . 
The official delegation will consist of four members: [PER Tomas Heidar  ] ; [PER Gisli Vikingsson  ] , a scientist from the [ORG Marine Research Institute  ] ; [PER Kristjan Loftsson  ] , owner of the whaling company [LOC Hvalur  ] , which is the only company with the capacity to hunt large whales such as fin whales ; and a fourth , unspecified person. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Begin responses to reftel ( note internal numbering ) : 9a . 
[PER Heidar  ] said in the report of the [ORG SWG  ] , there is a footnote indicating a reservation by two countries , one of which is [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Although [PER Heidar  ] described the footnote as inaccurate in detail , he said the principal meaning was conveyed . 
The [MISC Icelandic  ] delegation is concerned about the two stage process -- first separating [LOC Japan  ] and sanctuaries in one stage and then moving on to a second stage on general rules . 
In [LOC Iceland  ] 's view , the " Future " process should be combined in a single package . 
9b . 
[PER Heidar  ] said that the meetings should be closed to observers and for states only . 
He clarified that [LOC Iceland  ] has no difficulty speaking in front of observers , but it is their experience that others might not speak their mind in an open meeting . 
9c . 
[PER Heidar  ] said it would be more realistic to limit the number of participants in these discussions to the number of countries that are most affected . 
He further clarified this as meaning whaling countries and " the most outspoken on the other side " and a group of countries committed to the process . 
9d . 
[PER Heidar  ] 's recommendation for a Chair was that he/she be balanced . 
He asked about rumors that current Chair Dr. [PER Bill Hogarth  ] 's term would be extended . 
[PER Heidar  ] said that [LOC Iceland  ] would be willing to let [PER Hogarth  ] continue if the election is postponed . 
[LOC Iceland  ] will not present a candidate . 
[PER Heidar  ] also said the [MISC Nordic  ] group had met and there is no confirmed candidate from the group . 
10a . 
[PER Heidar  ] and [PER Egilsson  ] thought the chair of the [ORG SWG  ] had been effective . 
10b . 
[PER Heidar  ] and [PER Egilsson  ] did not have any recommendations regarding the chairmanship of the [ORG SWG  ] . 
16a . 
[PER Heidar  ] and [PER Egilsson  ] both emphatically said the [ORG GOI  ] is not involved in the trade of whale products: " the [ORG GOI  ] does not further trade or hinder it . 
" Rather , " trade is open and left to private parties to establish . 
" 16b . 
[PER Heidar  ] said there is no change in the principle behind [LOC Iceland  ] 's whaling ; " we are conducting sustainable whaling...that means it is conservation as it 's based on scientific advice . 
" [PER Heidar  ] said that for [ORG GOI  ] there are just two kinds of whaling -- sustainable and not sustainable . 
He said that is how whaling should be defined and sustainability should be kept in mind when talking about aboriginal whaling or research whaling . 
[PER Heidar  ] clarified that there are no changes this year to whaling but that future whaling had not been decided .
