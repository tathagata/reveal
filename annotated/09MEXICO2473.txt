( [ORG S/NOFORN  ] ) Summary: Since 1996 , [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [LOC Mexico City  ] has maintained an electronic database of all [MISC Mexican  ] military trained with [LOC U.S.  ] funds . 
These records show that the [ORG USG  ] has trained nearly of 5,000 [MISC Mexican  ] military personnel , including members of [LOC Mexico  ] 's [ORG Special Forces  ] ( GAFEs ) . 
Several prominent members of the [MISC Mexican  ] cartel [ORG Los ZETAS  ] , notorious for violent attacks , previously served in the [MISC Mexican  ] military 's special forces units . 
Rumors have long circulated suggesting that U.S.-trained members of the [MISC Mexican  ] military have become [ORG ZETAS  ] . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] actively vets [ORG GOM  ] security officials selected for participation in [MISC U.S.-funded  ] training programs for involvement in human rights abuses or other criminal activities . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] also sponsors training activities , exercises , and exchanges that promote human rights within the [MISC Mexican  ] military . 
Separately , the [MISC Mexican  ] Government has proposed legislation to increase the penalty for [ORG GOM  ] military personnel implicated in organized crime activities . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] conducted an extensive cross-check of our database of [MISC Mexican  ] military officials who participated in [MISC U.S.-funded  ] training programs against lists of known members of [ORG Los ZETAS  ] . 
The comparison of databases did not produce any hits . 
However , intelligence from other sources yielded the name of one individual was reportedly trained by [LOC U.S.  ] forces , retired from the [MISC Mexican  ] Military , was forcibly recruited into [ORG Los ZETAS  ] , and was later implicated in a plan to assassinate former [MISC Mexican  ] Deputy Attorney General [PER Jose Luis Vasconceles  ] . 
End Summary . 
The Raw Data <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Since 1996 , the [ORG Embassy  ] 's Office of [ORG Defense Coordination  ] ( [ORG ODC  ] ) has maintained an electronic database of all [MISC Mexican  ] military personnel that receive [MISC U.S.-funded  ] military training . 
The database categorizes the individuals by military organization -- [ORG SEDENA  ] or SEMAR -- as well as by the type of training they receive . 
The numbers below show [MISC Mexican  ] military members trained in the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Mexico  ] . 
The training in [LOC Mexico  ] by [LOC U.S.  ] personnel involves subject matter exchanges , seminars , conferences , and mobile training teams . 
The training conducted in the [LOC U.S.  ] normally is individual-level training , although some tactical-level training includes special forces training . 
According to [ORG ODC  ] 's database , since 1996 the [LOC U.S.  ] has trained the following number of [MISC Mexican  ] military personnel . 
1996 - 440 1997 - 236 1998 - 693 1999 - 1271 2000 - 282 2002 - 225 2003 - 207 2004 - 162 2005 - 185 2006 - 184 2008 - 177 2009 - 517 ( to be completed by end of [ORG FY  ] 09 ) Total: 4952 <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) From 1996-1998 , the [LOC U.S.  ] provided unit-specific training to 422 GAFEs . 
After 1998 , the [LOC U.S.  ] military discontinued unit level training programs , including [ORG GAFE  ] training , to concentrate on specialized individual military training . 
It is possible that the [LOC U.S.  ] provided training to individual GAFEs who participated as members of regular units . 
Cross-checking and Validating <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [ORG Embassy  ] 's [ORG DEA  ] office maintains a database of all [ORG ZETAS  ] who have been arrested , killed , or otherwise identified . 
The database relies on a variety of sources including the [ORG GOM  ] , informants , and press accounts . 
[ORG Los ZETAS  ] is a criminal organization that guards the identity of its members . 
We cannot know the names of every one of its [LOC MEXICO  ] 00002473 002 OF 002 members . 
Nevertheless , we have cross-checked the names of the nearly 5,000 [MISC Mexican  ] military personnel that we have trained since 1996 against the list of known [ORG ZETA  ] members that the [ORG DEA  ] compiles and have not found a match . 
( Note: Prior to 1996 , only hard copies of military orders exist . 
A review of these files suggests they are incomplete . 
Where paper files exist , we cross checked those names against the [ORG DEA  ] 's list and found no matches . 
End Note . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NOFORN  ] ) Separate sensitive collateral reporting indicates that [PER Rogelio Lopez Villafana  ] , a former [MISC Mexican  ] infantry lieutenant who retired from the [MISC Mexican  ] elite special forces , was forcibly recruited into [ORG Los ZETAS  ] . 
[PER Lopez  ] was later arrested and implicated in a plan to assassinate the former Deputy Attorney General for Legal and [ORG International Affairs  ] , [PER Jose Luis Santiago Vasconceles  ] , in January 2008 . 
The same sensitive collateral reporting indicates that [PER Lopez  ] received counter-narcotics operations training at [LOC Fort Bragg  ] , but the records do not include the specific date . 
In response to [ORG Embassy  ] queries , [LOC Fort Bragg  ] advised us that it could not recover any record on this individual . 
[LOC Fort Bragg  ] noted that its electronic training records only date back to 1996 . 
The [MISC Mexican  ] Army ( [ORG SEDENA  ] ) reported to the [ORG Embassy  ] that [PER Lopez  ] retired in July 2007 after completing 20 years and 8 months of service in the [MISC Mexican  ] Army . 
As a result , he could have trained in the [LOC U.S.  ] prior to the inception of the [ORG ODC  ] and [LOC Fort Bragg  ] electronic databases . 
Vetting and Training Provide Additional Protections <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Since 1998 , [LOC U.S.  ] law requires [PER Leahy  ] human rights vetting for any individual participating in [MISC U.S.-sponsored  ] training . 
Post and [ORG ODC  ] administers a robust human rights vetting program and every [MISC Mexican  ] participant in our military training program is subject to these legal requirements prior to the training event . 
By law , we deny training to any candidate implicated in a human rights abuse . 
Raising the Stakes For Soldiers Going Bad <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In April 2009 , President [PER Calderon  ] proposed a piece of legislation that would mandate a 60-year prison sentence for any member of the military that deserts and subsequently engages in organized crime activity . 
Drafters of the legislation hope that this bill will discourage soldiers from using their military training for criminal purposes . 
All major political parties agree on the bill 's content . 
Adoption of the bill would represent the first time the federal government directly mandates a change to the [MISC Mexican  ] Military Code . 
This point may generate some debate when the [MISC Mexican  ] [ORG Congress  ] reconvenes in September and reviews the bill. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NOFORN  ] ) Comment: Critics of [LOC U.S.  ] military training and conspiracy theorists have long speculated that members of the notoriously violent cartel [ORG Los ZETAS  ] once received [MISC U.S.-funded  ] special forces training . 
Since we cannot know the name of every [MISC Mexican  ] soldier who has joined [ORG Los ZETAS  ] , we cannot irrefutably reject this possibility . 
However , the [ORG Embassy  ] checked all available databases and obtained no adverse results . 
Additional records based on informant sources only yielded one case . 
Since 1998 , the [ORG USG  ] has vetted every candidate for [MISC U.S.-funded  ] military training for human rights abuses . 
It is impossible to guarantee that every [MISC Mexican  ] soldier who receives our training in the future will not defect to organized crime . 
We remain hopeful , however , that the passage of harsh legislation instituting a 60-year sentence for soldiers who become involved in organized crime will be a useful deterrent .
