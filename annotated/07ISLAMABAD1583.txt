( U ) On April 3 , President [PER Musharraf  ] met with Senator [PER John McCain  ] ( [ORG R-AZ  ] ) and Representative [PER Richard Renzi  ] ( [ORG R-AZ  ] ) , [PER Musharraf’s  ] third [ORG U.S. Congressional  ] delegation of the day ( reftel ) . 
The group , s discussion focused on [LOC Iraq  ] , the broader [LOC Middle East  ] , and the [MISC Pak-Afghan  ] border region. --------------------------------------------- -- [MISC Muslim  ] countries should play lead role in [LOC Iraq  ] And help solve the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] dispute --------------------------------------------- -- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Musharraf  ] noted that he and many [MISC Middle Eastern  ] leaders were worried that a premature pull-out of [LOC U.S.  ] and coalition forces from [LOC Iraq  ] would spread sectarian strife throughout the [LOC Gulf  ] region . 
[PER Musharraf  ] underlined the importance of increasing the capacity of the [MISC Iraqi  ] armed forces and police . 
He noted there could be little improvement in the situation in [LOC Iraq  ] without broader political participation from the [MISC Sunnis  ] . 
[PER Musharraf  ] agreed with Senator [PER McCain  ] that [MISC Muslim  ] countries needed to lead efforts to help [PER Iraq’s Shias  ] , [MISC Sunnis  ] , and [MISC Kurds  ] reach political consensus before a major withdrawal of coalition troops . 
[PER Musharraf  ] said he understood [LOC U.S.  ] public opinion was against prolonging [LOC U.S.  ] presence in [LOC Iraq  ] , but hoped [LOC U.S.  ] leadership could communicate the importance of the mission in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Turning to the future of [LOC Iraq  ] , [PER Musharraf  ] hoped that [MISC Muslim  ] peacekeeping troops ( including [MISC Pakistanis  ] ) could replace [LOC U.S.  ] forces under a [ORG United Nations  ] umbrella. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Conflicts outside [LOC Iraq  ] also contributed to the unstable situation in the region , [PER Musharraf  ] said . 
[PER Musharraf  ] noted that in addition to [MISC Saudi  ] King [PER Abdullah  ] , s work in forging an [MISC Arab  ] consensus on [LOC Iraq  ] , he was working on building consensus within the [MISC Muslim  ] world on the [MISC Palestinian  ] issue ) work that was slowly but surely bringing [LOC Syria  ] back into the [MISC Arab  ] fold . 
Alluding to his own outreach to the moderate [MISC Muslim  ] world , [PER Musharraf  ] noted there was space for non-Arab nations to play a role on [LOC Iraq  ] and the [MISC Israeli-Palestinian  ] dispute , and that [LOC Pakistan  ] , [LOC Indonesia  ] and [LOC Malaysia  ] had agreed to form a united voice to help promote peace in the region . 
[PER Musharraf  ] said he was the first non-Arab leader invited to address the [ORG Arab League Summit.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Musharraf  ] said he believed [MISC Syrian  ] President [PER Bashar al-Assad  ] could play a positive role in both [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Lebanon  ] , and that [PER Assad  ] could be “handled” if the [LOC U.S.  ] understood his issues: &If you want him to play ball , he needs comfort on other fronts -- namely , the [MISC Golan Heights.8  ] Turning to another [MISC Iraqi  ] neighbor , [PER Musharraf  ] agreed with the delegation that [LOC Iran  ] could not be allowed to create further divisions in [LOC Iraq.  ] ------------------------------------- The [MISC Pak-Afghan  ] border: Past decisions created present security problem ------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) When asked for his views on [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [PER Musharraf  ] ISLAMABAD 00001583 002 OF 003 said [LOC Pakistan  ] was facing the fallout from security decisions made in the 1980s . 
People who came to fight with the mujahideen against the [MISC Soviets  ] settled in [MISC Pakistan’s  ] tribal areas and now had families . 
These people -- mostly [MISC Uzbeks  ] and [MISC Arabs  ] -- developed links with al [ORG Qaeda  ] . 
Recently , tribal groups in both [LOC South  ] and [PER North Waziristan  ] were taking action against [MISC Uzbeks  ] and other foreigners because of the foreigners , cruel and high-handed behavior . 
[MISC Pakistan’s  ] military provided covert support in the form of arms and ammunition . 
[PER Musharraf  ] reported that in [LOC South  ] [PER Waziristan  ] , a large group of foreign militants were surrounded on a ridge and would soon surrender. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Originally , [PER Musharraf  ] said , the [ORG Taliban  ] movement was a reaction against growing tribalism and warlordism in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Since [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC India  ] supported [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] ( ethnic [MISC Tajik  ] ) [ORG Northern Alliance  ] , [MISC Pakistan’s  ] natural ally was the ( ethnic [MISC Pashtun  ] ) [ORG Taliban  ] . 
This all changed after 9/11 , [PER Musharraf  ] said , and [LOC Pakistan  ] had captured and killed hundreds of al [ORG Qaeda  ] fighters near [PER Tora Bora.  ] -------------------------------------- We’re Going After Militants: [PER Bin Laden  ] May Be Here , But [PER Mullah Omar’s  ] Not -------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( S/NF ) Echoing similar statements he , d made during an earlier meeting with [PER CODEL Tierney  ] ( reftel ) , [PER Musharraf  ] said that although he had no direct evidence , he thought al [ORG Qaeda  ] leaders [PER Osama Bin Laden  ] and [PER Ayman al-Zawahiri  ] were hiding in [LOC Bajaur Agency  ] , since it was in ( [MISC Afghan  ] militant leader ) [PER Gulbuddin Hekmatyar’s  ] territory and bordered [MISC Afghanistan’s  ] Konar province . 
The landscape in videos of [PER Bin Laden  ] and [PER Zawahiri  ] looked similar to [LOC Bajaur  ] , [PER Musharraf  ] said , and the area provided comfort , high mountains , positive support , and an absence of [LOC U.S.  ] troops in neighboring [LOC Konar.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Musharraf  ] voiced concern over [MISC Afghan  ] President [PER Karzai  ] , s frequent pronouncements about [MISC Pakistan’s  ] &failure8 to capture [ORG Taliban  ] leader [PER Mullah Omar  ] in [LOC Balochistan’s  ] capital [LOC Quetta.  ] &Let me tell you , 8 [PER Musharraf  ] emphasized , &Omar would be mad to be in [LOC Quetta  ] -- he has too many troops to command in southern [LOC Afghanistan  ] to make it feasible . 
In fact , the only parts of [LOC Balochistan  ] where there are [MISC Pakistani  ] [ORG Taliban  ] are in the province’s [MISC Afghan  ] refugee camps , which we are planning to shut down.8 [PER Musharraf  ] said that most [PER Pashtuns  ] in [LOC Balochistan  ] were traders and had no reason to join the [MISC Taliban.  ] &They want roads to increase their trade , not to fight.8 The same could not be said for the [LOC Federally Administered Tribal Areas  ] , [PER Musharraf  ] said. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Musharraf  ] said the [ORG Taliban  ] were mainly in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Karzai  ] , s policies , [PER Musharraf  ] believed , alienated [PER Afghanistan’s Pashtuns  ] by favoring ( ethnic [MISC Tajik  ] ) [ORG Panshiris  ] . 
After Coalition forces joined the [ORG Northern Alliance  ] to oust the [ORG Taliban  ] government , there was no change in the ethnic makeup of the victors when it came to planning . 
[ORG Panshiris  ] were disproportionately represented in the government , even though they had never ruled before and were , [PER Musharraf  ] believed , the natural enemy of the country’s majority [PER Pashtuns  ] . 
ISLAMABAD 00001583 003 OF 003 -------------------------------------- A New Strategy in the [MISC Tribal Areas  ] And the Ethnic Dimension in [LOC Afghanistan  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Turning to the [LOC Federally Administered Tribal Areas  ] , [PER Musharraf  ] stated that [ORG Taliban  ] militants from [LOC Afghanistan  ] drew support from [LOC Pakistan  ] for re-supply , hospitals , recruitment , and indoctrination of new troops . 
[PER Musharraf  ] emphasized military force alone could not deny terrorists safe haven in the [LOC Tribal Areas  ] over the long term . 
That was why , [PER Musharraf  ] explained , [LOC Pakistan  ] was pursuing a four-pronged strategy that included military , political , development , and administrative elements . 
The fencing of the [MISC Pak-Afghan  ] border in some parts of the [LOC Federally Administered Tribal Areas  ] would reduce some cross-border movement , he said , but it was not enough . 
[PER Musharraf  ] described development as the most forward-looking ) and in some ways most complex ) part of the strategy . 
[LOC Pakistan  ] was looking for [LOC U.S.  ] assistance and expertise. --------------------------------------------- --- Pakistan’s [MISC Taliban Problem Is An Extremism Issue  ] --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) One of [MISC Pakistan’s  ] biggest concerns , [PER Musharraf  ] said , was the spread of talibanization , especially into settled and urban areas . 
Countering talibanization required a well thought out strategy to cleanse society of the [ORG Taliban  ] culture and to encourage moderation . 
Modernization and economic development were the way forward , [PER Musharraf  ] noted . 
Talibanization was even spreading to [LOC Islamabad  ] , as you could see by the recent events at the [ORG Red Mosque  ] ( reported septel ) . -------------------------------------------- [ORG Afghanistan’s Poppy Industry Should Go Legal  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) In response to [MISC McCain’s  ] question about whether [PER Musharraf  ] was worried [LOC Afghanistan  ] would become a narco-state , [PER Musharraf  ] answered that he was , especially because if it did it would affect [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[PER Musharraf  ] thought [LOC Afghanistan  ] could follow the example of other countries -- such as [LOC India  ] -- where narcotics were purchased legally and channeled into the international pharmaceutical industry . 
It was a $500-600 million annual industry , [PER Musharraf  ] said , and the profits made from legal poppy sales could go toward poverty alleviation instead of to the [ORG Taliban  ] .
