End Summary . 
[PER Sunni Problem  ] , [ORG Shi'a Solution  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) In a 45-minute meeting with [PER CODEL Voinovich  ] , Vice President [PER Abdel Mehdi  ] stated that the last few months had seen a " shift in [LOC Iraq  ] 's situation " that went to the " root " of its core problem: [MISC Sunni  ] fears and frustrations , " whether valid or not valid , " caused by a loss of political dominance . 
He cited the willingness of [MISC Sunni  ] leaders in [LOC Anbar  ] province , " where all the trouble started , " to battle al-Qaeda as evidence of that shift , and attributed a change in [MISC Sunni  ] " mood " to " exhaustion " and a realization by [MISC Sunni  ] leaders that they had run out of options . 
Using [LOC Northern Ireland  ] as an analogy , he averred that insurgencies end when insurgents , even if not thoroughly defeated , realize they can not achieve their aims through violent means . 
[PER Abdel Mehdi  ] said he detected a changed mood among [MISC Iraqis  ] in general , stating that " in 2003 we were totally optimistic and in 2006 we were totally pessimistic , now we are exhausted and more realistic . 
" The 59 year-old [MISC Shi'a  ] politician stated that [LOC Iraq  ] 's " [MISC Sunni  ] problem " requires a " [MISC Shi'a  ] solution " through greater [MISC Shi'a  ] understanding and accommodation of [MISC Sunni  ] fears " even though the fears might not be just " but provided no details beyond " good governance " and better education. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Abdel Mehdi  ] said that while he and President [PER Talibani  ] were working hard to overcome mutual mistrust between [MISC Sunni  ] VP al-Hashemi and PM [PER Maliki  ] , the concept of power sharing had limits " because there can only be two or three top positions . 
" He identified lack of trust as a real problem among [MISC Iraqi  ] politicians , but not within ordinary [MISC Iraqi  ] society . 
As a measure of [LOC Iraq  ] 's growing political maturity , he pointed to the contrast between the [ORG GOI  ] 's inability to restrain retaliatory sectarian violence after the February 2006 bombing of [LOC Samara  ] 's [LOC al-Askari Mosque  ] , and the [ORG GOI  ] 's far more competent handling of the aftermath of a repeat bombing of the mosque several months ago that resulted in relatively little sectarian mayhem . 
He also pointed to private sector investment of USD 1.25 billion in [LOC Iraq  ] 's mobile telephone industry as evidence that [LOC Iraq  ] is moving forward , as it indicates investor confidence in [LOC Iraq  ] 's future . 
VP Senior Advisor [PER Fareed Yasseen  ] chimed in that while the western media never tires of stories about [LOC Iraq  ] 's problems , it pays scant attention to [MISC Iraqi  ] successes such as the stability of the [MISC Iraqi  ] Dinar , which he claimed has appreciated against the [LOC U.S.  ] dollar due to prudent [ORG GOI  ] fiscal and budgetary policy. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In reply to repeated questions and expressions of [MISC American  ] exasperation over the [ORG Iraqi Government  ] 's inability to achieve political reconciliation , [PER Abdel Mehdi  ] conceded limited progress but cited recent agreement [LOC Iraq  ] 's top leaders on the broad outlines of de-Ba'athification , amnesty , and detainee release . 
On several occasions he cautioned that political reconciliation and [LOC Iraq  ] 's " radical " transformation from dictatorship to democracy will take time: to drive home [LOC BAGHDAD  ] 00002838 002 OF 002 his point , he half-jokingly surmised that there may be some people in [LOC Tennessee  ] , the home state of [PER Senators Alexander  ] and [PER Corker  ] , who have yet to be reconciled to the outcome of the [MISC American Civil War  ] . 
He insisted that the [ORG Iraqi Government  ] should not be held responsible for all of [LOC Iraq  ] 's problems , citing al-Qaeda as " an international problem " and complaining of support by [LOC Iraq  ] 's neighbors for malign internal elements . 
For example , he listed [LOC Syria  ] , [LOC Iran  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , and [LOC Egypt  ] as sources of support or foreign fighters for internal [MISC Iraqi  ] violence , and stated that visiting [MISC French  ] Foreign Minister [PER Kouchner  ] told him [LOC France  ] had detained 42 fighters who were headed to [LOC Iraq  ] . 
He also stated that the [ORG Iraqi Government  ] was fearful that its efforts could " backfire " if it acted too hastily . 
[PER Abdel Mehdi  ] opined that [LOC Iraq  ] 's enemies believe the [MISC Iraqi  ] and [MISC American  ] governments are " nervous and want to force us into making mistakes . 
" A recurring meeting theme was expression of [ORG Senatorial  ] impatience met with [PER Abdel Mehdi  ] 's plea for greater patience: Senator [PER Voinovich  ] stated the [ORG GOI  ] badly needs a " dramatic " political achievement to ensure status quo [ORG USG  ] support , while [PER Abdel Mehdi  ] asked the [ORG USG  ] to not " throw away your past sacrifices " through a precipitate change in policy . 
[LOC Iran  ] , al-Sadr , [PER al-Sistani  ] ------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Abdel Mehdi  ] said he shares [MISC American  ] concerns regarding [MISC Iranian  ] activity in [LOC Iraq  ] , adding that the recent assassinations of two provincial governors from [LOC Iraq  ] 's southern [MISC Shi'a  ] belt ( both of whom were affiliated with [PER Abdel Mehdi  ] 's ISCI/Badr political movement ) were " probably " perpetrated by the [ORG Mahdi Army  ] ( [ORG JAM  ] ) . 
He stated that [LOC Iran  ] was exploiting some [MISC Iraqi  ] [MISC Shi'a  ] elements , but declined to express an opinion on the extent of [MISC Iranian  ] influence over [PER Muqtada al-Sadr  ] , [ORG JAM  ] 's spiritual leader . 
Recounting an anecdote about recent mortar attacks on [LOC Baghdad  ] 's [ORG International Zone  ] ( where [PER Abdel Mehdi  ] lives and works ) , he stated that an [MISC Iranian  ] official told him [LOC Iran  ] had pressured al-Sadr followers to cease such attacks: [PER Abdel Mehdi  ] said with a chuckle that the official 's statement unwittingly revealed [MISC Iranian  ] complicity in the attacks . 
He claimed that al-Sadr has " only 3 percent " of the influence and public prestige held by [LOC Iraq  ] 's supreme [MISC Shi'a  ] prelate [PER Ali al-Sistani  ] among [LOC Iraq  ] 's majority [MISC Shi'a  ] population , and he hailed [PER al-Sistani  ] 's efforts to counsel [MISC Shi'a  ] calm and peace in the wake of repeated provocative violence by [MISC Sunnis  ] . 
Senator [PER Voinovich  ] asked him to pass a message of thanks to al-Sistani. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( U ) CODEL [PER Voinovich  ] did not have an opportunity to review this message .
