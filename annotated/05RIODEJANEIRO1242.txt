( [ORG SBU  ] ) State Secretary for Security [PER Marcelo Itagiba  ] told the [PER Hyde  ] [MISC CODEL on November  ] 30 that police are implementing a number of programs to better combat crime and drug trafficking in violence-plagued [LOC Rio de Janeiro  ] state . 
While drug-related crime remains a major problem , the state 's murder rate has dropped -- in part due to an increase in the confiscation of illegal firearms . 
[PER Itagiba  ] , fluent in [MISC English  ] and a close Mission contact , called on other state agencies , family , the media , schools and the church to do their part to combat widespread drug use and improve public security in [LOC Rio  ] . 
[PER Itagiba  ] 's determination seemed to impress the [ORG CODEL  ] , but [LOC Rio  ] 's high crime rate continues to impact Consulate employees ; just two weeks ago an [ORG FSN  ] was carjacked at gunpoint while running errands before the [PER Marine Ball  ] . 
End Summary . 
Assembling the Tools to Combat Crime ------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [PER Itagiba  ] briefed members of the [PER Hyde  ] [MISC CODEL on November  ] 30 at the [ORG Marriott Hotel  ] . 
Participants included Representatives [PER Henry Hyde  ] ( [ORG R-IL  ] ) , [PER Tom Lantos  ] ( [ORG D-CA  ] ) , [PER Mel Watt  ] ( [ORG D-NC  ] ) , [PER Diane Watson  ] ( [ORG D-CA  ] ) , and [PER Luis Fortuno  ] ( [ORG R-PR  ] ) . 
Also present were their staffers , the Charge , [PER CG Atkins  ] , [ORG RSO  ] , [ORG Poloff  ] and [ORG Conoff  ] notetaker. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Itagiba  ] described a series of measures which are better positioning [LOC Rio  ] 's law enforcement community to fight the state 's notoriously high crime rate . 
Over the past six years , the state 's [ORG Military Police  ] ( " first responders " who prevent crime ) and [ORG Civil Police  ] ( the investigative agency that solves non-Federal crimes ) have augmented their staffs by at least 30 percent . 
More patrol cars , modernized precinct buildings , better training , more extensive coursework at universities and improved technology - including the installation of 220 video cameras across the city of [LOC Rio  ] - are improving police capabilities and have produced tangible results , [PER Itagiba  ] said . 
Another contributing factor appears to be an increase in the seizure of illegal firearms ; in 1995 , police seized approximately 5,000 weapons , with 8,000 murders recorded in [LOC Rio  ] state . 
To compare , in 2004 police captured approximately 15,000 firearms , but only 6,400 murders were recorded . 
[PER Itagiba  ] displayed a graph showing a correlation between the increase in the number of guns seized and a drop in the murder rate . 
Laying [MISC Societal Problems On  ] the [ORG Doorstep of Law Enforcement  ] ------------------------------- -------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Responsibility for the violence plaguing [LOC Rio  ] should not fall on the doorstep of law enforcement , [PER Itagiba  ] said . 
Many crimes stem from personal or business conflicts and are thus difficult for the police to prevent . 
Families , schools and the church must do their part to provide guidance . 
Similarly , the private sector has responsibility to prevent acts of " delinquency " ; a nightclub , for example , should provide security and prevent drinking-related violence from spilling into the street . 
The [MISC Brazilian  ] government shares the blame too: haphazard planning and urban overcrowding have led to a 30% increase in the number of slums in [LOC Rio  ] , while inadequate public transportation has forced low-paid construction workers to cram into far-flung shantytowns to build the middle -class high rises burgeoning in the suburbs . 
In conditions of despair , [PER Itagiba  ] said , many people lose their perspective and commit crimes . 
Widespread Drug Use and [MISC Trafficking Makes Matters Worse  ] ------------------- --------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) A significant portion of [LOC Rio  ] crime stems from drug trafficking . 
Criminal gangs steal money and cars to raise funds for traffickers to buy drugs from outside [LOC Rio  ] state . 
The drugs are then trafficked elsewhere or sold domestically , in the hillside slums ( favelas ) interspersed throughout [LOC Rio  ] . 
Domestic consumption is a major problem as well . 
Ten percent of the state 's population , or 1.4 million people , use illegal drugs - often in broad daylight in public spaces , such as in [LOC Ipanema  ] , home to many Consulate employees . 
Interestingly , [LOC Rio  ] state does not produce its own drugs or guns ; these are imported from [LOC Colombia  ] , [LOC Peru  ] and [LOC Bolivia  ] . 
Representatives from the major drug gangs in these countries operate in [LOC Rio  ] , [PER Itagiba  ] said . 
Comment ------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG CODEL  ] members were clearly impressed with [PER Itagiba  ] 's claim that 78 drug lords have been arrested or killed under his watch ( since 1999 ) , with only one major player still at-large . 
Nevertheless , drug-related crime in [LOC Rio  ] continues to dominate the headlines and impact the lives of Consulate employees . 
Three weeks ago , an [ORG FSN  ] was car- jacked at gunpoint in a middle-class neighborhood as she was returning a DVD at a store . 
Shortly before that , 15 gunmen took over an apartment building two doors down from the residence of the Assistant [ORG RSO  ] , seeking to rob the apartments inside . 
Forty people were held hostage for three hours , including five [MISC Americans  ] . 
A month ago , an attempted apartment invasion was thwarted by police a block away frm the [PER CG  ] 's residence . 
Given the size of the internal drug market and lax law enforcement regarding consumption , trafficking and related crime remain huge problems here .
