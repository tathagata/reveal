( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Summary:  ] The [MISC Icelandic  ] parliament 's return after its holiday recess has been marred by the largest protests the country has experienced since the 1949 debate over [ORG NATO  ] membership . 
By some estimates , as many as 2,000 demonstrators caused enough noise to force a halt to the opening legislative session on the afternoon of January 20 . 
The [ORG Althingi  ] reconvened later in the day , amidst protests so severe that members of the cabinet were unable to leave the building for several hours after the session finally concluded . 
The demonstrations have carried on into a second day , forcing another disruption in the legislative schedule and sparking a tense confrontation in front of the Prime Minister 's Office . 
Tension within the governing coalition is at an all-time high , and the government appears to be at a loss for ways to lower the temperature . 
Early elections later this year now seem a near-certainty , with even the Deputy Chair of the junior coalition party openly calling for them . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) On January 20 , the [MISC Icelandic  ] parliament -- the [ORG Althingi  ] -- reconvened after a month-long holiday break . 
During the holiday recess , the protest movements sparked by this fall 's economic collapse continued to organize at least one demonstration weekly , generally in the square in front of the [ORG Althingi  ] . 
Though attendance and enthusiasm dipped over the holidays , many predicted that pressure would start to rise again in January , both as a result of the [ORG Althingi  ] 's return as well as the fact that the severance packages from many of the autumn layoffs would expire during the month . 
( Unemployment has gone from 5.8 percent on Dec. 24 to 7.3 percent on January 20 . 
) A foretaste came on Dec. 31 , when protestors burst into a hotel on the square where a televised talk show with the country 's political leaders was taking place . 
They were removed by police using pepper spray , but not before they managed to halt the broadcast by setting fire to some of the transmission equipment. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) On January 20 , as many as 2,000 protestors quickly surrounded the [ORG Althingi  ] after it reconvened . 
The atmosphere was tense as protestors generated thunderous noise , threw eggs , snowballs , and paint as they called for new elections while lawmakers tried to continue with their session . 
Some protestors banged on the windows of the parliament building and set off firecrackers . 
Police used pepper spray repeatedly to control the crowd , which grew in size and intensity enough to force a delay in the [ORG Althingi  ] session . 
Inside the building , the opposition [ORG Left-Green Movement  ] used question time and open debate to reiterate its support for the protesters , and several [MISC Left-Green  ] MPs used the recess periods to go outside and join the protest . 
Over 100 police officers were present and over 30 people were arrested , among them many teenagers . 
As night fell , the demonstrators lit a bonfire outside the [ORG Althingi  ] and added park benches as well as the [MISC Christmas  ] tree given annually to the [LOC City  ] of [LOC Reykjavik  ] from [LOC Oslo  ] . 
Some MPs , including the Speaker of the Parliament , could not leave the building until late evening . 
The protest ended shortly after 3 a.m. following a series of violent confrontations between police and small groups of protestors . 
Most observers report that the demonstrations were only equaled by the unforgettable 1949 protests against [ORG NATO  ] accession. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) The following day , as protestors gathered again outside the building , the Speaker of the [ORG Althingi  ] cancelled the parliament 's scheduled session and instead held a meeting with the chairmen of the political parties . 
They decided that on January 22 the parliament will conduct a lengthy debate on economic issues , at which time PM [PER Geir Haarde  ] will present a report on the economic situation . 
This did little to sate the assembled protestors , who later moved to the Prime Minister 's Office and repeated the tactics of the previous day . 
A tense confrontation ensued when PM [PER Haarde  ] attempted to leave the building , as protestors blocked his car from leaving and threw eggs and other projectiles at the vehicle . 
They were finally removed by the PM 's security detail. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Tensions are very high within the coalition government as well as outside government buildings . 
Opposition parties have strengthened their call for early elections , with [ORG Left-Green Chair  ] [PER Steingrimur Sigfusson  ] asking the government what other way it might have in mind to meet the demands of the nation . 
The [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] ( [ORG SDA  ] ) , the junior party in the coalition , has moved from quiet agitation to near-open rebellion , as the [ORG SDA  ] Deputy Chair said in a media interview on Jan. 21 that early elections this spring are " unavoidable . 
" On January 21 , the [ORG Reykjavik Chapter  ] of the [ORG SDA  ] , the party 's largest , will be holding a meeting to discuss the coalition with the [ORG Independence Party  ] ( [ORG IP  ] ) . 
Many [ORG SDA  ] members believe that the meeting will pass a resolution calling for early elections . 
Meanwhile , [ORG IP  ] dissatisfaction with PM [PER Haarde  ] is also [ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000012 002 OF 002 growing , a week ahead of that party 's national congress . 
Emboffs have heard from two [ORG IP  ] insiders in the last day that many fear the PM is " not doing anything " and that the situation will only get worse absent some dramatic action . 
The only prominent [ORG IP  ] comment in the last 24 hours has been the Justice Minister 's statement that police are ready to deal more harshly with protestors should they continue to break the law. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: The January 21 demonstration may have been a turning point in the political situation here . 
The raw emotion of the demonstrations has shocked and unsettled Icelanders unaccustomed to open civil strife . 
The linkage to the 1949 [ORG NATO  ] riots , which are seared into [LOC Iceland  ] 's collective memory , is telling . 
The cabinet , especially the [ORG IP  ] , appears confused as to how to contain the escalating disorders . 
Coverage of the Prime Minister 's embarrassing encounters with the protestors has not reassured the public regarding his leadership abilities . 
Undoubtedly , the government 's response has been hindered by the absence of Foreign Minister and [ORG SDA Chair  ] Ingibjorg [PER Solrun Gisladottir  ] , who is in [LOC Sweden  ] receiving ( unexpectedly prolonged ) treatment for a brain tumor diagnosed last fall . 
Without [PER Gisladottir  ] 's calm leadership , the [ORG SDA  ] is having difficulty finding a coherent message . 
As the country 's new special prosecutor investigating last fall 's economic collapse begins his work this month , reports of corruption in [MISC Icelandic  ] business life will only fuel popular dissatisfaction . 
Absent some bold and effective move to release public pressure , the assessment of early elections as " unavoidable " may prove to be right .
