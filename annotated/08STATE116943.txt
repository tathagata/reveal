( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG EUR  ] - [LOC Ireland  ] - Emergency Action Committee ( [ORG EAC  ] ) [LOC Belfast  ] met October 31 to discuss the armed forces homecoming parade scheduled for November 2 and the planned simultaneous counter-demonstrations by [PER Sinn Fein  ] and the dissident republican group [ORG Eirigi  ] . 
Discussions centered on the parade route and the possibility of confrontations and violence in different areas , as well as the presence of [LOC AmCits  ] along the parade and demonstration routes . 
The [ORG EAC  ] decided the [LOC U.S.  ] Consulate General should release a [ORG Warden Message  ] to warn [LOC AmCits  ] in [LOC Belfast  ] . 
( [LOC Belfast  ] 0137 ) <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Sweden  ] - Approximately 12 to 15 protesters , carrying banners and flags requesting fair treatment for the &Cuban [LOC Five8  ] in [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] , [LOC Cuba  ] , made an unscheduled appearance at [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG Embassy Stockholm  ] November 1 . 
The group emerged from the nearby [MISC German  ] Embassy and stopped briefly in front of [ORG Post  ] . 
The [ORG RSO  ] monitored the group ; they did not attempt to contact [ORG Embassy  ] officials , but appeared more interested in photographing the front of [ORG Post  ] . 
The protesters departed within a few minutes before [MISC Embassy  ] police could respond . 
No damages or injuries were reported .

( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [ORG NEA  ] - [LOC Egypt  ] - [ORG EAC  ] Cairo convened October 20 to review recent threat reporting and access any threats specific to the planned visit by [LOC U.S.  ] Secretary of State [PER Condoleezza Rice  ] on November 8 and 9 . 
The [ORG EAC  ] agreed there is no new , specific , and/or credible threat to [LOC U.S.  ] interests in [LOC Egypt  ] , but also assessed that [LOC Egypt  ] remains a very tempting target for both indigenous and transnational terrorist elements . 
[ORG EAC  ] members also agreed to enhance security measures at the [MISC American Presence Post  ] in [LOC Alexandria  ] . 
The [ORG EAC  ] continues to assess the Government of [LOC Egypt  ] , s ( [ORG GoE  ] ) counterterrorism efforts as effective , and [ORG Post  ] has a close relationship with the [ORG GoE  ] on security matters . 
( Appendix 1 ) <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [LOC Kuwait  ] - [ORG EAC Kuwait City  ] convened November 2 to discuss the security impact of recent threat reporting , Embassy [LOC Kuwait  ] election coverage , [ORG U.S. Marine Corps  ] Birthday [ORG Ball  ] , and the upcoming visit of the former [LOC U.S.  ] President [PER William J. Clinton  ] . 
The [ORG EAC  ] was briefed on the recent reporting of possible terrorist surveillance of housing areas within [LOC Kuwait City  ] . 
[ORG Post  ] is coordinating the release of this information to the [ORG Kuwait Security Service  ] for further action . 
The [ORG RSO  ] stated the [ORG Local Guard Force  ] ( [ORG LGF  ] ) [ORG Mobile Patrol  ] unit will increase coverage in the housing occupied by Chief of Mission personnel within the named areas , defensive counterintelligence training with be given to locally employed staff , and a Security Notice reminding personnel to remain vigilant in their personal security procedures will be released . 
The [ORG EAC  ] concluded that [ORG Post  ] , s current security posture is appropriate for the planned events .

( [ORG S//NF  ] ) EAP - [LOC Indonesia  ] - [ORG EAC Jakarta  ] convened October 30 to discuss the security implications of the anticipated execution of the [LOC Bali  ] bombers . 
The Government of [LOC Indonesia  ] ( GoI ) recently announced they would be executed during the first week of November . 
Rumors are circulating around [LOC Jakarta  ] that retaliatory attacks and demonstrations by those who support the bombers are possible . 
However , there is no specific or credible information regarding the planning of these types of attacks . 
One report mentioned possible suicide bomber attacks on shopping malls in [LOC Jakarta  ] , specifically the [LOC Kelapa Gading  ] mall in northern [LOC Jakarta  ] , but without details . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy assesses the likelihood of a terrorist attack conducted against [LOC U.S.  ] or other [MISC Western  ] interests in direct response to the executions is low .

[PER Ali Shah  ] and 20 others were wounded , and nine police officers were killed in the attack . 
On November 1 , at approximately 2:33 a.m. , an explosion occurred at a police substation approximately 2,000 meters from the [LOC U.S.  ] Consulate [LOC Peshawar  ] residential area and official annexes . 
One police officer was killed and several other individuals were badly wounded . 
It is undetermined at this time whether the explosion was from a rocket or an explosion charge placed at the structure . 
The [ORG RSO  ] will monitor these attacks .

( [ORG S//FGI//NF  ] ) [ORG NEA  ] - [LOC Lebanon  ] - Al-Qa , ida affiliate to attack [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Embassy  ] motorcade: According to a source of the [MISC Jordanian  ] General Intelligence Directorate , as of mid-October , al-Qa , ida-affiliated elements in the Ayn al-Hilwah [MISC Palestinian  ] refugee camp plan to attack a [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Embassy  ] motorcade in [LOC Beirut  ] . 
The men planning the operation had already collected an unspecified amount of explosives and a white 1983 [MISC Mercedes  ] , which was currently inside the [MISC Shatila Palestinian  ] refugee camp . 
The [MISC Mercedes  ] was to be rigged with the explosives . 
( Appendix source 4 ) <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S//FGI//NF  ] ) [ORG SCA  ] - [LOC Maldives  ] - Continued monitoring of al-Qa , ida associates: The [ORG Maldives Police Service  ] continued to investigate and monitor the activities of [MISC Maldives-based  ] al-Qa , ida associates [PER Yoosuf Izadhy  ] , [PER Easa Ali  ] , and [PER Hasnain Abdullah Hameedh  ] ( a.k.a . 
Hameed ) . 
[PER Izadhy  ] was reportedly in contact with a militant group in [LOC Waziristan  ] , which allegedly maintained unspecified links to al-Qa , ida . 
[PER Izadhy  ] was clandestinely working to recruit others into his organization , specifically seeking individuals who had undergone basic terrorism training in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
[PER Izadhy  ] planned to create a terrorist group in the [LOC Maldives  ] with the assistance of the [MISC Waziristan-based  ] group . 
[PER Izadhy  ] planned to send his members to [LOC Waziristan  ] for training . 
[PER Hameedh  ] was in close contact with a number of individuals who had undergone training in [LOC Pakistan  ] , including individuals who were members of [ORG Jamaat-ul Muslimeen  ] and completed basic and advanced training by [ORG Lashkar-e-Tayyiba  ] ( [ORG LT  ] ) in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
They followed the ideology of [LOC Abu Easa.  ] <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S//FGI//NF  ] ) [ORG DS/TIA/ITA  ] notes , while the operational aspirations of [PER Yoosuf Izadhy  ] ( Terrorist [ORG Identities Datamart Environment  ] ( [ORG TIDE  ] ) number 17312323 ) , [PER Easa Ali  ] ( [ORG TIDE  ] number 17312652 ) , and [PER Hasnain Abdullah Hameedh  ] ( [ORG TIDE  ] number 20686145 ) are unclear ; past reporting suggests [MISC Maldivian  ] extremists have demonstrated interest in actively participating in global jihadi activities by attempting to arrange travel and terrorist training in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
While many [MISC Maldivian  ] participants of extremist online forums aimed to ultimately fight Coalition forces in [LOC Iraq  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] , mid-October 2007 debrief information following the September 29 bombing in Male that targeted tourists indicates at least two of the operatives participated in the attack in exchange for travel from the islands after the operation and arranged study at a madrassa in [LOC Pakistan.  ] <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Specific links to al-Qa , ida remain unclear ; although , reporting from May detailed recruitment activity by [MISC Maldivian  ] national [PER Ahmed Zaki  ] of [LOC Maldivians  ] into the [PER Kashmiri  ] extremist group [ORG LT  ] madrassas and training camps in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
A variety of reports from 2006 details linkages between [LOC Maldivians  ] belonging to a group known as [ORG Jama-ah-tul-Muslimeen  ] ( [ORG JTM  ] ) and individuals participating in an anti-American [MISC Islamic  ] extremist online forum called [ORG Tibyan Publications  ] . 
[ORG JTM  ] is an extremist group based in the [LOC UK  ] that follows an extremist ideology known as Takfiir that actively encourages violent jihad and supports criminality against apostate states .

( [ORG U  ] ) Threats & Analysis <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [ORG WHA  ] - [LOC Mexico  ] - Violence spikes again in [MISC Tijuana:  ] According to a mid-level [LOC Baja California  ] state police official , a turf war between the [ORG Arellano Felix Organization  ] ( [ORG AFO  ] ) and the [ORG Sinaloa Cartel  ] has caused another increase in violence in [LOC Tijuana  ] . 
The [MISC Mexican  ] Government , s counternarcotics efforts -- in the form of 3,300 military and police assets patrolling the area under Operation [LOC Tijuana  ] -- have severely weakened the [ORG AFO  ] , s operations . 
The [ORG Sinaloa Cartel  ] , hoping to capitalize on the [ORG AFO  ] , s weaknesses , is battling for control of [LOC Tijuana  ] , s drug plaza . 
While the [ORG AFO  ] assassins are skilled , [ORG Sinaloa Cartel  ] hit men are poorly trained and have no aversion to public shootings ; however , if the [ORG Sinaloa Cartel  ] successfully ousts the [ORG AFO  ] from [LOC Tijuana  ] , [ORG DS/TIA/ITA  ] notes the levels of violence should decrease . 
While residents and visitors are not being targeted , the likelihood of being in the wrong place at the wrong time is of increasing concern . 
Cartel targets are being killed during daytime hours in public areas of [LOC Tijuana  ] , including restaurants , shopping centers , and near school buildings . 
The DoS , [ORG Travel Alert for Mexico  ] was extended for six months on October 14 to reflect the current and widely reported crime and violence occurring throughout [LOC Mexico  ] .

( [ORG U  ] ) AF - [LOC Cameroon  ] - An examination of the background , goals , and tactics of the [ORG Niger Delta Defense and Security Council  ] and the [ORG Bakassi Freedom Fighters:  ] ( [ORG S//NF  ] ) The October 31 kidnapping of approximately 10 hostages off the shores of the [ORG Bakassi Peninsula  ] has magnified the role of two groups -- the [ORG Bakassi Freedom Fighters  ] ( [ORG BFF  ] ) and the [ORG Niger Delta Defense and Security Council  ] ( [ORG NDDSC  ] ) -- in the increasing insecurity in the [ORG Bakassi  ] . 
The kidnappings , an overview of the [ORG NDDSC  ] , s and [ORG BFF  ] , s background , and an examination of their past operations , highlight the groups , possible intent to use novel , deadly , and unprecedented tactics to achieve their goals. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In the early morning of October 31 , a group of armed men in three boats attacked a [MISC French  ] Total vessel named [PER Bourbon Sagita  ] , which was located off the [MISC Cameroonian  ] shore between [ORG Bakassi  ] and [LOC Limbe  ] . 
Although no [MISC Americans  ] were directly impacted , at least seven [MISC French  ] citizens , one [MISC Tunisian  ] , one [MISC Senegalese  ] , and several [MISC Cameroonian  ] nationals were kidnapped ; five remaining oil workers were left on the boat . 
Nobody was injured in the attack. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to unconfirmed media reports , shortly after the raid , the [ORG BFF  ] , part of a larger and shadowy alliance of the [ORG NDDSC  ] , claimed responsibility for the attacks and threatened to kill the hostages , stating , &The 10 are in our hands . 
If you don , t tell the government of [LOC Cameroon  ] to come here and discuss with us , we will kill them all in three days.8 On November 1 , the [ORG NDDSC/BFF  ] withdrew the threat , but stated it would hold the hostages until the government opened negotiations with them. <a id='par24' href='#par24'>¶</a>24 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) The [ORG NDDSC/BFF  ] is likely referring to discussions over the status of the [ORG Bakassi Peninsula  ] in its statement . 
The region was transferred from [LOC Nigeria  ] to [LOC Cameroon  ] on August 14 , per an [ORG International Court of Justice  ] ruling . 
According to e-mails it sent to media outlets , the [ORG NDDSC/BFF  ] merged into an official alliance at the end of July in an attempt to forestall the hand over . 
Led by Commander [PER Ebi Dari  ] and General [PER A.G. Dasuo  ] , who claim they are fighting for &self-determination and freedom8 of the [ORG Bakassi Peninsula  ] which contains a majority of [MISC Nigerian  ] citizens . 
They are also demanding that two of their fighters captured in July be released and that [MISC Nigerians  ] on the [ORG Bakassi Peninsula  ] be compensated. <a id='par25' href='#par25'>¶</a>25 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) An intelligence and open media search of the [ORG BFF  ] provided negligible results . 
Meanwhile , although little background information is known about the [ORG NDDSC  ] , it claims to have approximately 1,050 fighters . 
It has been in existence since at least 2002 and previously conducted low-level attacks against [MISC Cameroonian  ] troops on the [ORG Bakassi  ] . 
It can also be linked to three deadly operations prior to the hand over of the controversial region . 
In the most macabre raid , on June 9 , the [ORG NDDSC  ] allegedly killed and mutilated six members of a [MISC Cameroonian  ] delegation visiting the [ORG Peninsula  ] , including the deputy subregional commander . 
It also claimed responsibility for a November 2007 raid on a [MISC Cameroonian  ] military outpost which killed 21 soldiers ; this claim remains unconfirmed . 
( Please see the July 26 DS Daily for further information on the pre-hand over security incidents in the [ORG Bakassi  ] . 
) <a id='par26' href='#par26'>¶</a>26 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Although the post-hand over period has been defined by a series of attacks , the [ORG NDDSC/BFF  ] has released statements denying culpability in some of those operations . 
These include a September 28 bank robbery in [LOC Limbe  ] and a September 13 attack against a trawler off the [ORG Bakassi Peninsula  ] . 
The [ORG NDDSC/BFF  ] may be responsible for some post-hand over operations , while others may have been conducted by different militants in the region , including in the [ORG Niger Delta  ] . 
Despite similar tactics in all these operations , including the use of speedboats carrying heavily armed masked men , at this time , there are no clear indications the [ORG NDDSC/BFF  ] has a defined relationship with the [ORG Movement for the Emancipation  ] of the [ORG Niger Delta  ] ( [ORG MEND  ] ) or any other prominent [ORG Niger Delta  ] group. <a id='par27' href='#par27'>¶</a>27 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Instead , the series of raids by the [ORG NDDSC/BFF  ] may possibly signify new tactics being pursued in the [ORG Bakassi  ] region . 
In its early raids , the [ORG NDDSC/BFF  ] primarily used deadly and brutal force against the [MISC Cameroonian  ] military , but often spared expatriates and civilians . 
Two recent attacks , however -- the June 9 attack and the October 31 hostage-taking operation -- have demonstrated its desire to expand its targets . 
In the June 6 raid , the [ORG NDDSC  ] targeted a political delegation and mutilated a deputy subregional commander , the equivalent of a governor . 
It is unclear if the [ORG NDDSC  ] was directly targeting the governor ; but , nevertheless , the group demonstrated its desire to also kill politicians . 
For its part , the October 31 attacks was the first kidnapping of expatriates off the coast of [LOC Cameroon.  ] <a id='par28' href='#par28'>¶</a>28 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Also of concern is the [ORG NDDSC/BFF  ] , s intent to hold hostages indefinitely after initially threatening to kill them . 
Whereas [ORG MEND  ] and other [LOC Delta  ] groups kidnapped hostages primarily to garner ransom money or to force oil companies to scale back operations , they had seldom directly harmed or threatened to kill hostages . 
They also often released hostages shortly after their capture . 
Moreover , given its intent to hold the hostages for a political objective , the [ORG NDDSC/BFF  ] may find it convenient to continue operations against expatriates in the region to pressure the [MISC Cameroonian  ] Government and to ensure that its political demands are met .

( [ORG S//FGI//NF  ] ) [ORG SCA  ] - [LOC Bangladesh  ] - Rejection of [ORG IDP  ] to register for December elections: As of late October , the [ORG Bangladeshi Election Commission  ] was set to reject the [ORG Islamic Democratic Party  ] , s ( [ORG IDP  ] , s ) attempt to register for the December parliamentary elections . 
The [ORG IDP  ] is a nascent political party formed by senior members of the [MISC Islamic  ] terrorist group [ORG Harakat-ul-Jihad-i-Islami Bangladesh  ] ( [ORG HUJI-B  ] ) . 
[LOC Bangladesh  ] , s [ORG Directorate General of Forces Intelligence  ] ( [ORG DGFI  ] ) supported the formation of the [ORG IDP  ] as a way to bring [ORG HUJI-B  ] into the mainstream and reported it tightly monitored the group , s activities ; although , [ORG HUJI-B  ] has never renounced the use of violence to implement its vision of transforming [LOC Bangladesh  ] into a [MISC Muslim  ] theocracy . 
According to [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy [LOC Dhaka  ] , which strongly opposed the creation of the [ORG IDP  ] , the party and its leadership will likely be angered by the decision and may respond with violence possibly against the commission or the [LOC U.S. Mission  ] or interests. <a id='par30' href='#par30'>¶</a>30 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) Arrests and monitoring have undoubtedly hindered [ORG HUJI-B  ] , s capabilities in recent years , and it is entirely plausible the group is pursuing the creation of a political wing to improve its ability to support and carry out terrorist activity . 
A late-September assessment from [LOC Bangladesh  ] , s [ORG National Security Intelligence Organization  ] ( [ORG NSI  ] ) voiced concern that the party , s creation would free extremists to pursue extremist activity under the cover of a moderate front organization . 
Indeed , there are no indications [ORG IDP  ] would garner a significant number of votes . 
Analysis from the [ORG DoS , Office of Research  ] noted the majority of [LOC Bangladeshis  ] want [ORG Awami League  ] and [ORG Bangladesh National Party  ] leaders [PER Sheikh Hasina  ] and [PER Khaleda Zia  ] to participate in the December elections . 
Interestingly , 80 percent stated they would ignore a call by either party to boycott the vote . 
One-third further stated they would join street protests in the face of a cancellation of elections. <a id='par31' href='#par31'>¶</a>31 . 
( [ORG S//FGI//NF  ] ) Although there is little information available regarding [ORG HUJI-B  ] , s current capabilities , its membership likely does retain the ability to manufacture and use explosives and has previously favored targeting high-profile individuals for attack . 
While there is no specific reporting at the present time detailing plots against [LOC U.S.  ] interests in [LOC Bangladesh  ] , the group has publicly articulated its anti-Western and -Indian stance , including signing [PER Usama Bin Ladin  ] , s 1998 fatwa against the [LOC West  ] . 
In regards to [ORG HUJI-B  ] , s capabilities , [ORG DGFI  ] , s , [ORG Rapid Action Battalion  ] , s ( [ORG RAB  ] , s ) , and [ORG NSI  ] , s assessments vary significantly . 
Following the early-March [LOC U.S.  ] designation of [ORG HUJI-B  ] as a foreign terrorist organization , [ORG RAB  ] assessed [ORG HUJI-B  ] would not respond with violence due to the severe degradation of the group , s capability and leadership structure from arrests and active surveillance . 
Some member who wanted to independently attack [MISC Western  ] interests , however , remained technically capable of carrying out low-level attacks using small arms , grenades , and IEDs . 
[ORG DGFI  ] likewise reported [ORG HUJI-B  ] was &an organization on the run8 and that it did not pose a threat to [LOC U.S.  ] interests in [LOC Bangladesh  ] . 
[ORG NSI  ] conversely assessed [ORG HUJI-B  ] would react violently to the designation and would attempt to conduct an attack against the [LOC U.S.  ] official presence in [LOC Dhaka  ] ; although , there was no information available detailing such an operation . 
Thus far , [ORG HUJI-B  ] has not carried out an attack against [MISC American  ] interests in [LOC Bangladesh  ] , but the group has been linked to assassination attempts on intellectuals , journalists , and politicians , including two thwarted attempts on the life of Prime Minister [PER Sheikh Hasina  ] during public addresses and a grenade attack that injured the [MISC British  ] high commissioner in May 2004 .

( [LOC S//REL  ] TO [LOC USA  ] , [LOC FVEY  ] ) WHA - CTAD comment: On October 16 , at least one e-mail account within the Government of [LOC Canada  ] received a Trojanized message from a [ORG Yahoo  ] account claiming to represent a [LOC U.S.  ] embassy . 
The bogus subject line was an invitation for a private meeting with a named DoS employee . 
The attached [MISC Microsoft Word  ] document was a malicious &invitation8 file that , when opened , attempts to beacon and create a connection to &jingl.cable.nu8 via port 8080 . 
The &cable.nu8 domain remains one of concern , as it has historically been associated with activity from [MISC Chinese  ] hacker organizations. <a id='par34' href='#par34'>¶</a>34 . 
( U ) EUR - CTAD comment: The [ORG European Commission  ] ( [ORG EC  ] ) this week proposed legislation to establish a [ORG Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network  ] ( [ORG CIWIN  ] ) to improve information sharing among [ORG European Union  ] ( [ORG EU  ] ) member nations . 
The proposed legislation would enable the [ORG EC  ] to launch and manage the [ORG CIWIN  ] , a secure information technology ( IT ) system aimed at sharing knowledge on threats , vulnerabilities , and protection of critical infrastructures . 
The [ORG CIWIN  ] would be a voluntary tool for transmitting sensitive information and would also include a rapid alert system for critical infrastructure , allowing [ORG EU  ] nations to post alerts on immediate threats. <a id='par35' href='#par35'>¶</a>35 . 
( U ) AF - CTAD comment: [MISC Sudanese  ] law enforcement recently reported the arrest of three hackers who have allegedly attacked more than 300 government and public websites during the last few months . 
Among the hacked sites was that of the [ORG National Telecommunication Corporation  ] , which is responsible for oversight of telecommunication service providers as well as many other aspects of [MISC Sudanese  ] IT and network stability . 
The three highly skilled hackers , all of whom are [MISC Sudanese  ] , reportedly caused significant damage to their targets , but their motivation for the attacks and any potential group affiliations are yet undetermined. <a id='par36' href='#par36'>¶</a>36 . 
( C ) [ORG NEA  ] - CTAD comment: On October 21 , officials from the [ORG Kuwaiti Central Agency for Information  ] ( [ORG CAIT  ] ) and the [ORG National Security Bureau  ] ( [ORG NSB  ] ) expressed concerns for foreign and domestic threats to [MISC Kuwaiti  ] information systems . 
According to these organizations , some of the issues plaguing Government of [LOC Kuwait  ] ( [ORG GoK  ] ) networks are suspected attacks from [MISC Iranian  ] hackers , insider corruption and misuse of resources , and a lack of sufficient interagency coordination and guidance for monitoring users , activities and investigating incidents . 
For example , the groups , inability to adequately examine malicious software ( malware ) injections or internal abuse of system access continues to hinder the [ORG GoK  ] , s capacity to ensure the protection of sensitive information . 
Therefore , the [ORG CAIT  ] and [ORG NSB  ] are interested in learning more about [LOC U.S.  ] cyber security programs as well as receiving additional training and support. <a id='par37' href='#par37'>¶</a>37 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) EAP - CTAD comment: Between September 29 and October 2 , a conference was held by the [ORG German Federal Office  ] for the Protection of the [MISC Constitution  ] ( [ORG BfV  ] ) . 
During this conference , the [ORG BfV  ] delivered a briefing on its analysis of the cyber threat posed by the People , s [LOC Republic of China  ] ( [LOC PRC  ] ) , which appears to mirror conclusions drawn by the [ORG U.S. Intelligence Community  ] . 
The [ORG BfV  ] surmises the intention of [LOC PRC  ] actors is espionage , and the primary attack vector used in their malicious activity is socially engineered e-mail messages containing malware attachments and/or embedded links to hostile websites . 
According to reporting , &from October 2006 to October 2007 , 500 such e-mail operations were conducted against a wide range of [MISC German  ] organizations , 8 and the attacks appear to be increasing in scope and sophistication . 
The socially engineered e-mail messages delivered to [MISC German  ] computer systems were spoofed to appear to come from trusted sources and contain information &targeted specifically to the recipient , s interests , duties , or current events.8 This malicious activity has targeted a wide variety of [MISC German  ] organizational levels to include &German military , economic , science and technology , commercial , diplomatic , research and development , as well as high-level government ( ministry and chancellery ) systems.8 In addition , [MISC German  ] intelligence reporting indicates an increase in activity was detected immediately preceding events such as [MISC German  ] Government , or commercial , negotiations involving [MISC Chinese  ] interests. <a id='par38' href='#par38'>¶</a>38 .

( [LOC S//REL  ] TO [LOC USA  ] , [LOC FVEY  ] ) Source paragraph: &Byzantine Candor ( [ORG BC  ] ) actors have compromised multiple systems located at a [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Internet  ] service provider ( [ORG ISP  ] ) and have used the systems as part of [ORG BC  ] , s [MISC U.S.-based  ] attack infrastructure since at least March , targeting multiple victims including at least one [ORG USG  ] agency.8 <a id='par42' href='#par42'>¶</a>42 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) CTAD comment: Since late 2002 , [ORG USG  ] organizations have been targeted with social-engineering online attacks by [ORG BC  ] actors . 
[ORG BC  ] , an intrusion subset of [LOC Byzantine Hades  ] activity , is a series of related computer network intrusions affecting [LOC U.S.  ] and foreign systems and is believed to originate from the [LOC PRC  ] . 
[ORG BC  ] intruders have relied on techniques including exploiting Windows system vulnerabilities and stealing login credentials to gain access to hundreds of [ORG USG  ] and cleared defense contractor systems over the years . 
In the [LOC U.S.  ] , the majority of the systems [ORG BC  ] actors have targeted belong to the [LOC U.S.  ] Army , but targets also include other DoD services as well as DoS , [ORG Department of Energy  ] , additional [ORG USG  ] entities , and commercial systems and networks . 
[ORG BC  ] actors typically gain initial access with the use of highly targeted socially engineered e-mail messages , which fool recipients into inadvertently compromising their systems . 
The intruders then install malware such as customized keystroke-logging software and command-and-control ( [ORG C&C  ] ) utilities onto the compromised systems and exfiltrate massive amounts of sensitive data from the networks . 
This month , [ORG BC  ] actors attempted to compromise the network of a [LOC U.S.  ] political organization via socially engineered e-mail messages ( see CTAD Daily Read File dated October 16 ) . <a id='par43' href='#par43'>¶</a>43 . 
( [LOC S//REL  ] TO [LOC USA  ] , [ORG ACGU  ] ) CTAD comment: Also discovered this month by [ORG USG  ] analysts was the compromise of several computer systems located at a commercial [ORG ISP  ] within the [LOC United States  ] . 
According to [ORG Air Force Office of Special Investigations  ] ( [ORG AFOSI  ] ) reporting , hackers based in [LOC Shanghai  ] and linked to the [LOC PRC  ] , s People , s [ORG Liberation Army  ] ( [ORG PLA  ] ) [ORG Third Department  ] have been using these compromised systems as part of the larger [ORG BC  ] attack infrastructure to facilitate computer network exploitation ( [ORG CNE  ] ) of [LOC U.S.  ] and foreign information systems . 
Since March , the responsible actors have used at least three separate systems at the unnamed [ORG ISP  ] in multiple network intrusions and have exfiltrated data via these systems , including data from at least one [ORG USG  ] agency . 
[ORG AFOSI  ] reporting indicates , on March 11 , [ORG BC  ] actors gained access to one system at the [ORG ISP  ] , onto which the actors transferred multiple files , including several [ORG C&C  ] tools . 
From here , the intruders used the tools to obtain a list of usernames and password hashes for the system . 
Next , on April 22 , [ORG BC  ] actors accessed a second system at the [ORG ISP  ] , where they transferred additional software tools . 
From April through October 13 , the [ORG BC  ] actors used this computer system to conduct [ORG CNE  ] on multiple victims . 
During this time period , the actors exfiltrated at least 50 megabytes of e-mail messages and attached documents , as well as a complete list of usernames and passwords from an unspecified [ORG USG  ] agency . 
Additionally , multiple files were transferred to the compromised [ORG ISP  ] system from other BC-associated systems that have been previously identified collecting e-mail messages from additional victims . 
The third system at the [LOC U.S.  ] [ORG ISP  ] was identified as compromised on August 14 , when [ORG BC  ] actors transferred a malicious file onto it named &salaryincrease-surveyandforecast.zip.8 According to [ORG AFOSI  ] analysis , [ORG BC  ] actors use this system to host multiple webpages that allow other BC-compromised systems to download malicious files or be redirected to [ORG BC C&C  ] servers. <a id='par44' href='#par44'>¶</a>44 . 
( [LOC S//REL  ] TO [LOC USA  ] , [LOC FVEY  ] ) CTAD comment: Additional DoD reporting this month indicates [ORG BC  ] actors have used multiple other systems to conduct [ORG CNE  ] against [LOC U.S.  ] and foreign systems from February through September . 
A October 23 DoD cable states [MISC Shanghai-based  ] hackers associated with [ORG BC  ] activity and linked to the [ORG PLA  ] have successfully targeted multiple [LOC U.S.  ] entities during this time period . 
The cable details dozens of identified [MISC Internet  ] Protocol ( [MISC IP  ] ) addresses associated with [ORG BC  ] activity as well as the dates of their activity . 
All of the [MISC IP  ] addresses listed resolve to the [ORG CNC Group Shanghai Province Network  ] in [LOC Shanghai  ] , and all the host names of the addresses contained [MISC Asian  ] keyboard settings as well as [LOC China  ] time zone settings . 
Most of these [MISC IP  ] addresses were identified as responsible for direct [ORG CNE  ] of [LOC U.S.  ] entities , including unspecified [ORG USG  ] organizations , systems and networks . 
Interestingly , although the actors using each [MISC IP  ] address practiced some degree of operational security to obfuscate their identities , one particular actor was identified as lacking in these security measures . 
On June 7 , the [ORG BC  ] actor , using an identified [MISC IP  ] address , was observed using a [MISC Taiwan-based  ] online bulletin board service for personal use. <a id='par45' href='#par45'>¶</a>45 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [ORG CTAD  ] comment: [ORG BC  ] actors have targeted the DoS in the past on multiple occasions with socially engineered e-mail messages containing malicious attached files and have successfully exfiltrated sensitive information from DoS unclassified networks . 
As such , it is possible these actors will attempt to compromise DoS networks in the future . 
As [ORG BC  ] activity continues across the DoD and [LOC U.S.  ] , DoS personnel should practice conscientious [MISC Internet  ] and e-mail use and should remain informed on BH activity .
