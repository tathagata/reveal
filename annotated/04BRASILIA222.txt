( U ) Summary: Members of [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Federal Chamber  ] 's [ORG Investigative Commission  ] ( [MISC CPI  ] ) on Piracy briefed visitors from the [ORG U.S. General Accounting Office  ] and [LOC Emboffs  ] on January 20 . 
Describing the work of the [MISC CPI  ] and the extent of the piracy problem in [LOC Brazil  ] , the federal deputies expressed their appreciation of the interest of the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] in this issue and signaled their desire for further consultations in [LOC Washington  ] . 
Biopiracy , threats to health and safety , raising public consciousness and addressing the root causes of piracy were among the issues covered . 
The [MISC CPI  ] is making preparations for drafting its final report ( expected in June ) , planning town hall meetings in several cities to engage the public as well as a working group session with private-sector representatives next week in [LOC Brasilia  ] . 
End Summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Just returning from the holidays to an extraordinary session of the [ORG Congress  ] called by the President , [MISC Brazilian  ] Federal Deputy [PER Luiz Medeiros  ] ( [ORG PL-SP  ] ) , met with visitors from the [ORG U.S. General Accounting Office  ] and [LOC Emboffs  ] on January 20 . 
[PER Medeiros  ] presided over an hour-long session that included expositions from other [MISC CPI  ] members on subjects ranging from biopiracy to [LOC China  ] , questions and answers from the [ORG GAO  ] team , and his own vignettes from investigations . 
He began the meeting by extolling the [MISC CPI  ] 's work and reputation . 
He recognized that piracy in [LOC Brazil  ] is intimately linked with corruption , organized crime and the drug trade , citing the case of three shopping centers selling pirated goods in [LOC Sao Paulo  ] , owned and operated by the [MISC Chinese  ] mafia , that were temporarily shut down last month through the efforts of the [MISC CPI  ] and enforcement officials ( see ref A ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Medeiros  ] also highlighted the negative consequences of piracy on economic development as evinced in the case of a [ORG Toshiba  ] factory in [LOC Brazil  ] considering closure due to the unfair competition from contraband and pirates . 
According to [PER Medeiros  ] , police discovered a factory assembling [ORG Toshiba  ] laptop look-a-likes with used contraband computer parts , posing as a computer repair shop . 
Before police could initiate an investigation and raid , a federal judge intervened attesting to the legitimacy of the repair shop . 
The [MISC CPI  ] later discovered that the judge in question was himself under investigation in [MISC Operation Anaconda  ] , a wide-ranging [ORG Federal Police  ] corruption investigation . 
More than simply a question of tax evasion , job losses and trampled intellectual property rights , pirated , often sub-standard , goods such as medicines and auto-parts present a real threat to the health and safety of [MISC Brazilians  ] , he said. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The extension of the [MISC CPI  ] until June 2004 and the formation of a [ORG Congressional  ] caucus ( " [MISC Frente Parlamentar  ] " in [MISC Portuguese  ] ) devoted to the issue of piracy and tax evasion evidenced the strong public support of the [MISC CPI  ] 's work , according to [PER Medeiros  ] . 
Therefore , the [MISC CPI  ] has an obligation to provide realistic proposals for improving the situation . 
Toward that end , the [MISC CPI  ] has maintained a very open atmosphere , seeking input from the private sector , law enforcement officials , and the judiciary . 
While the [MISC CPI  ] has supported public awareness campaigns , such as the [MISC Anti-Piracy Day  ] activities ( see ref B ) [PER Medeiros  ] told us that [MISC CPI  ] wants to involve the general public in formulating its report . 
Depending on the availability of funding , the [MISC CPI  ] hopes to hold several town-hall meetings in large cities around the country to get feedback from [MISC Brazilian  ] citizens on how to effectively combat piracy . 
He invited Emboff to participate in a working group session with private sector representatives to be held in [LOC Brasilia  ] February 4 . 
[PER Medeiros  ] , however , noted the absence of contact from the [ORG Interministerial Committee  ] to Combat Piracy ( [ORG CICP  ] ) , the executive body formed by the GoB in 2001 , although he made no mention of inviting input from the [ORG CICP  ] . 
He said that the [MISC CPI  ] would seek modifications to the [ORG CICP  ] , but did not elaborate further. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Approximately 10 deputies on the [MISC CPI  ] joined the discussion , many praising the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] 's interest in their legislative effort to address piracy . 
Deputy Sarney-Filho ( PV- [LOC MA  ] ) , a former Minister of Environment , stressed the need for a wider vision of the problem to include biopiracy and trafficking in protected species . 
Sarney-Filho encouraged [LOC Brazil  ] 's support for transnational legislation to address piracy in all of its forms . 
Other deputies spoke of the difficulties enforcement officials face with minimal resources , inadequate laws ( for example , the requirement for indefinite storage of seized goods ) , and at times an unsupportive judiciary . 
They asked for information on [LOC U.S.  ] legislation and procedures regarding seizures and targeted customs inspections . 
[PER Vanessa Grazziotin  ] ( [ORG PCdoB-AM  ] ) noted that [LOC China  ] receives more than its fair share of criticism as a supplier of pirated goods to the world , saying other [MISC Asian  ] and [LOC East European  ] countries merit investigation as well . 
She spoke of the difficulty customs inspectors faced in differentiating between simply contraband goods and pirated goods . 
Recognizing that poverty plays a significant role in [LOC Brazil  ] 's piracy problem , deputies discussed the merits of seeking ways to increase the cost of pirated goods as well as lower the cost of legitimate products . 
Comment ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC CPI  ] members clearly stated their desire to produce a useful and relevant document , and to have a long-term impact on the [ORG Federal Government  ] 's treatment of the piracy issue . 
They are cognizant of the difficulties ahead , including the five-month timeframe in which they must complete their work . 
The [MISC CPI  ] has thus far managed to avoid becoming politicized . 
Engaging the general public as fully as they have engaged the private sector will assist in producing a balanced set of proposals and lessen the possibility that the final report is perceived as primarily pro-private sector to the detriment of the larger [MISC Brazilian  ] populace. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) The [MISC CPI  ] is working to keep the issue in the spotlight . 
Since the beginning of the year , the " [LOC Estado de Sao Paulo  ] " newspaper , with the country 's second-largest circulation , has published at least two articles featuring the [ORG Association for Protection of Intellectual Property  ] ( [ORG ADEPI  ] ) and the [MISC CPI  ] . 
One editorial cited the " real possibility " of [MISC U.S.-applied  ] commercial sanctions against [LOC Brazil  ] due to the country 's failure to effectively combat piracy , a reference to the GSP review of last October . 
A recent RadioBras ( [LOC Brazil  ] 's [LOC National Radio  ] ) report featured the [MISC CPI  ] and the [ORG Interministerial Committee  ] as two of the main fronts in the fight against piracy , working to educate and protect the [MISC Brazilian  ] public . 
Maintaining this positive momentum after the [MISC CPI  ] 's closure will be a challenge , an issue likely to be addressed by private sector representatives at the February 4 working group session with the [LOC CPI.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Meeting with members of the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] active on piracy issues is high on the [MISC CPI  ] 's agenda , and may in part explain their willingness to meet with us at such an inopportune time . 
IPR trade associations are working to organize a [MISC Brazilian  ] legislators' visit to the [LOC U.S.  ] in late March , one aim being meetings with members of [ORG Congress  ] 's two Piracy/IPR caucuses . 
Mission strongly recommends that the Department facilitate such meetings and looks forward to communicating details of the visit through the appropriate point of contact in the [ORG Legislative Affairs Bureau  ] as soon as they are available .
