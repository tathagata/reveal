( U ) June 25 , 2009 ; 8:45 am ; [ORG The Hague  ] , [LOC Netherlands.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Participants: [LOC United States  ] ------------- [PER Craig Kelly  ] , Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary , [ORG WHA Eric Falls  ] ( Embassy notetaker ) [LOC Netherlands  ] ----------- [PER Laurent Stokvis  ] , MFA Director for [MISC Western  ] Hemisphere Affairs [PER Peter Potman  ] , Chief , [MISC North American  ] Affairs [PER Walter Oostelbos  ] , Chief , [MISC South American  ] Affairs [PER Jan Jaap Groenemeijer  ] , [ORG Senior Policy Advisor  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Summary: In a cordial , 45 minute meeting , [ORG WHA Principal Deputy Assistant  ] Secretary [PER Kelly  ] and the [MISC Dutch  ] MFA Director [PER Stokvis  ] discussed [LOC Cuba  ] , [LOC Nicaragua  ] , [LOC Bolivia  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] , and other issues . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] emphasized their support for recent [MISC American  ] efforts to expand dialogue with [LOC Latin America  ] . 
[LOC Cuba  ] ---- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) PDAS [PER Kelly  ] noted the President , s message that there exists a moment of opportunity for improving relations in the [MISC Western  ] hemisphere . 
The President has announced several steps related to [LOC Cuba  ] , and [LOC Cuba  ] and the [LOC United States  ] will resume migration talks on July 14 in [LOC New York  ] , the first such talks in five years. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Stokvis  ] praised [LOC U.S.  ] policy developments , noting it was very important for the [LOC U.S.  ] position in the hemisphere . 
He added that the [ORG Helms-Burton Act  ] creates a horrible situation for companies facing [ORG EU  ] action if they don't participate in [LOC Cuba  ] trade , and [LOC U.S.  ] penalties if they do. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Stokvis  ] emphasized the [ORG EU  ] , s strong support for dialogue . 
In accordance with [ORG EU  ] policy , the [MISC Dutch  ] are trying to have a dialogue , but [LOC Cuba  ] wants a guarantee that there will be no meetings between [ORG GONL  ] officials and [MISC Cuban  ] [ORG NGOs  ] . 
Again in accordance with [ORG EU  ] policy , the [LOC Netherlands  ] cannot accept this precondition . 
Therefore , the bilateral dialogue is blocked . 
[LOC Cuba  ] is treated as a political issue -- human rights is the primary thing for us -- as the [MISC Dutch  ] do not hold substantial economic interests in [LOC Cuba  ] . 
[LOC Northern Europe  ] takes the same position as the [LOC Netherlands  ] , but the [MISC Swedes  ] will have a difficult time managing diverging [ORG EU  ] opinions when they take on the [ORG EU  ] presidency in July . 
In [LOC Cuba  ] , policy is unlikely to change while [PER Fidel  ] remains in power , and there are unlikely to be any results on political prisoners . 
[LOC Nicaragua  ] --------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Kelly  ] stated the [ORG Millennium Challenge Corporation  ] ( [ORG MCC  ] ) follows established governance indicators , and the [ORG MCC  ] cut support to [LOC Nicaragua  ] due to the problems with the municipal elections . 
President [PER Ortega  ] is following President [PER Chavez  ] , s playbook of blaming the [LOC United States  ] for various internal problems . 
As a result , [LOC U.S.  ] embassies in a few countries are trying to engage with all sectors despite host government pressure to self-censor and avoid a whole range of normal activities. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Stokvis  ] said that while the [LOC Netherlands  ] has been a long-time donor in [LOC Nicaragua  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] cut budget support to the [ORG GON  ] after the recent voting fraud and [PER FM Santos  ] , s refusal to offer guarantees to support democratic reform . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] froze 6 million euros in budget support in 2008 , and 12 million euros in 2009 . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are concerned that while they have worked to move the [ORG EU  ] to cut budget support , international financial institutions continue to assist the [ORG GON  ] . 
However , [MISC Dutch  ] Minister for [ORG Development Cooperation Koenders  ] does not intend to raise this issue publicly , but will instead push the issue quietly in order to maintain influence in [LOC Nicaragua  ] . 
[LOC Bolivia  ] ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Stokvis  ] said that the [MISC Dutch  ] give 42 million euros Q9 . 
( C ) [PER Stokvis  ] said that the [MISC Dutch  ] give 42 million euros annually toward [MISC Bolivian  ] development , with total , lifetime contributions near 1 billion euros . 
However , while they have good relations with [LOC Bolivia  ] , it does not mean that they are able to influence President [PER Morales  ] . 
Regarding [LOC U.S.  ] THE HAGUE 00000404 002.2 OF 002 relations , the [MISC Dutch  ] support recent [LOC U.S.  ] overtures to [LOC Bolivia  ] as the ( best ) way forward . 
The GOB MFA Director General told the [MISC Dutch  ] he was not happy being at loggerheads with the [MISC Americans  ] , but the [MISC Dutch  ] believe nonetheless that there is deep GOB resistance to closer bilateral relations . 
Regarding counterdrug efforts , the [MISC Dutch  ] believe [ORG DEA  ] can be heavy-handed , but the [ORG EU  ] cannot and does not want to replace [LOC U.S.  ] programs . 
[PER Stokvis  ] urged the return of a [LOC U.S.  ] ambassador to [LOC Bolivia  ] , though the [LOC United States  ] should move slowly and carefully. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Kelly  ] responded that the [LOC United States  ] would welcome Brazil-EU-U.S. cooperation on this issue . 
[LOC Brazil  ] is keenly interested in [LOC Bolivia  ] to ensure gas supplies for [LOC Sao Paolo  ] and limit drug trafficking . 
There will be a private [MISC USG-GOB  ] dialogue on June 29-30 . 
( [PER Note:  ] The meeting was subsequently pushed back . 
End note . 
) It is positive that President [PER Morales  ] appears uneasy about growing drug trafficking in [LOC Bolivia  ] and does not appear to want to lead a narco-state . 
More troubling is the fact that [MISC Mexican  ] cartels may be moving south . 
( [PER Note: Oostelbos  ] agreed , noting that he had heard from [MISC Peruvian  ] officials that they are concerned about the presence of [MISC Mexican  ] cartels . 
End note . 
) [PER Kelly  ] encouraged [ORG EU  ] messages of concern about the drug trafficking . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] --------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [PER Stokvis  ] began stating , we look carefully at [LOC Venezuela  ] because it is a neighboring country to the [LOC Netherlands Antilles  ] and [LOC Aruba  ] , which are part of the [MISC Kingdom of the Netherlands  ] . 
[LOC Venezuela  ] sees the [LOC Netherlands Antilles  ] as an unsinkable [LOC U.S.  ] aircraft carrier . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] regularly explain to the [ORG GOV  ] that [LOC U.S.  ] ship visits to [LOC Curacao  ] are not a threat , but there still exists a certain suspicion from time to time . 
( [PER Note: Stokvis  ] added that the [MISC Dutch  ] look carefully at [LOC U.S.  ] nuclear aircraft carrier clearances , but otherwise offer automatic clearance to [LOC U.S.  ] ships . 
End Note . 
) As a general rule , the [MISC Dutch  ] want to maintain good relations . 
For example , the [MISC Dutch  ] have ongoing contracts to upgrade the [LOC Curacao  ] oil refinery , which is leased by [LOC Venezuela  ] , s petroleum company , [ORG PVDSA  ] . 
Good relations are also important for tourism -- for example , visitors to [ORG Willemstad  ] buy [MISC Venezuelan  ] goods . 
There is practical cooperation between the [ORG GONL  ] and [ORG GOV  ] on counternarcotics . 
Nonetheless , it is proving to be exceptionally difficult to get into discussions with the [ORG GOV  ] . 
Within [LOC Venezuela  ] , the economic difficulties are getting worse , particularly with ongoing nationalizations . 
Poverty and medical care are so problematic that even the basic care provided by [MISC Cuban  ] doctors is well received . 
It is clear [PER Chavez  ] is becoming more autocratic and will stay a long time , although human rights in [LOC Venezuela  ] are not bad . 
Although the [MISC Dutch  ] have increasing worries about [LOC Venezuela  ] , they continue to seek opportunities for dialogue. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Kelly  ] responded that [LOC Washington  ] will send Ambassador [PER Duddy  ] back to [LOC Caracas  ] , and that [LOC Washington  ] was also looking for opportunities for dialogue . 
At the same time , we will make our principles clear , for example on freedom of expression . 
The opposition party Mayor of [LOC Caracas  ] has been completely undercut by [PER Chavez  ] , who has restricted the mayor , s authority so that he cannot even manage the city , s firefighters . 
The mayor said that the [LOC U.S.  ] statements on freedom of the press were well received . 
Other Issues ------------ <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) [PER Stokvis  ] said the [MISC GONL-USG  ] agreements on Forward Operating Locations in the [LOC Caribbean  ] will be extended , QOperating Locations in the [LOC Caribbean  ] will be extended , although the MFA prefers to leave the renewal process as it is because parliament will otherwise ask questions and raise tensions with [LOC Venezuela.  ] <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) [PER Stokvis  ] requested that the [LOC United States  ] share information on the pathways to prosperity initiative , and [PER Kelly  ] promised to follow up . 
[PER Kelly  ] added the [LOC United States  ] intends to host a fall event on female entrepreneurs in [LOC Latin America  ] and would like to get the [ORG EU  ] involved. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( U ) This cable was cleared by PDAS [PER Kelly  ] .
