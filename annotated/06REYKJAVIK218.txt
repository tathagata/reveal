( C ) SUMMARY . 
In meetings with Embassy officials June 13 and 14 , [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG MFA  ] officials indicated agreement on most key issues for the June 19-30 first session of the [ORG UN Human Rights Council  ] ( [ORG HRC  ] ) . 
The [ORG Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples  ] may prove to be a sticking point , as [MISC Nordic  ] solidarity dictates that [LOC Iceland  ] should not openly oppose what has been a [MISC Norwegian  ] priority . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) Poloff discussed reftel demarche with [ORG MFA Political Department Human Rights  ] Officer [PER Ingibjorg Davidsdottir  ] June <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
The Ambassador followed up June 14 with a call on [ORG MFA Permanent  ] Secretary [PER Gunnar Snorri Gunnarsson  ] in which she emphasized establishing effective [ORG HRC  ] processes and maintaining a lean agenda , and outlined the potential problems with the [ORG Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples  ] . 
Both [PER Davidsdottir  ] and [PER Gunnarsson  ] expressed sympathy with [LOC U.S.  ] views but said final decisions on [MISC Icelandic  ] positions would need to be cleared by new Foreign Minister [PER Valgerdur Sverrisdottir  ] ( note: who took office June 15 ; end note ) . 
[PER Sverrisdottir  ] may herself travel to [LOC Geneva  ] for the [ORG HRC  ] session . 
NATURE OF THE FIRST SESSION --------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [LOC Iceland  ] [ORG MFA  ] officials agree that the first session of the [ORG HRC  ] must avoid the rancor of the organization 's predecessor body by eschewing country-specific resolutions such as those that the [ORG Organization of the Islamic Conference  ] may intend to raise against [LOC Israel  ] . 
That said , [LOC Iceland  ] will/will take positions on any country resolutions that do get discussed . 
ESTABLISHMENT OF WORKING GROUPS ------------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [ORG GOI  ] agrees that there must be a review of [ORG Human Rights Commission  ] mandates and that older mandates and special procedures ( rapporteurs ) should be extended one year for review -- indeed , [PER Davidsdottir  ] said she saw no realistic alternative . 
She added , however , that as [LOC Iceland  ] has a member on the [MISC Sub-Commission  ] on [ORG Human Rights  ] the [ORG GOI  ] probably would not speak out in favor of that body 's elimination. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Davidsdottir  ] agrees that there should be a working group to establish the processes and rules for the new [MISC Universal Periodic Review  ] mechanism . 
[ORG DECLARATION ON RIGHTS  ] OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES ------------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG Declaration on Rights of Indigenous Peoples  ] presents the main impediment to full [MISC Icelandic  ] cooperation with the [LOC U.S.  ] in [LOC Geneva  ] . 
While [PER Davidsdottir  ] personally shares our concern that the [ORG Declaration  ] 's text is seriously flawed , she and [PER Gunnarsson  ] asserted that [LOC Iceland  ] 's equities lie with following the [MISC Scandinavian  ] lead in supporting the document . 
[LOC Iceland  ] is the only [MISC Nordic  ] country without an indigenous population. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Comment: As [PER Sverrisdottir  ] , who comes from six years at [LOC Iceland  ] 's [ORG Ministry of Industry  ] and [ORG Commerce  ] , is a foreign affairs neophyte , we expect her to accept the [ORG MFA  ] career officials' advice on what positions [LOC Iceland  ] should take at the [ORG HRC  ] . 
Unfortunately , that is likely to include going along with the other [MISC Nordics  ] in their outreach to indigenous peoples . 
End comment .
