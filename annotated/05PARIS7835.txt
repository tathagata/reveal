( C ) [LOC PARIS  ] 7527 Classified By: Pol/MC [PER Josiah Rosenblatt  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Summary: The perpetrators of the urban rampaging ( refs ) in [LOC France  ] are by and large of [MISC Arab-African  ] and [MISC Black-African  ] background . 
In most cases , they are also [MISC Muslims  ] , raising the question as to what extent their religious affiliation helps explain the explosion in [LOC France  ] 's immigrant suburbs . 
There is widespread agreement that unemployment and lack of education , and not religious affiliation , are the primary factors underlying the angry hopelessness of urban youth . 
That said , responsible commentators on the situation -- from officials who monitor potential support for terrorist activities to rights activists with long experience working in troubled neighborhoods -- see religious affiliation as a complicating factor . 
Thus far most of the youths in question , while happening to be [MISC Muslim  ] by culture , are generally not viewed as individually inspired by [MISC Islam  ] , just as [MISC Islamic  ] political groupings are generally not viewed as being directly behind the violence . 
Observers note , however , that these groups have not hesitated to try to exploit the unrest for their own purposes , just as extremist and nativist politicians on the far-right have played to racism and xenophobic fears . 
The government 's decision to turn to [MISC Muslim  ] leaders to quell the unrest is itself seen by some as misdirected and a bad precedent , in contradiction with the [MISC French  ] republic 's strict secularism . 
In sum , while efforts to politicize the unrest are seen as unsuccessful to date , there is concern that not " getting it right " in dealing with the problems of [LOC France  ] 's underclass [MISC Muslims  ] could eventually produce the very [MISC Islamic  ] extremism identity that ( almost ) no one wants . 
End summary . 
No direct links to [MISC Islamic  ] extremism ------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Though it has carefully watched for it , the [MISC French  ] Government has not discerned any significant link between [MISC Islamic  ] extremism and the recent unrest . 
As [PER Christophe Chaboud  ] , head of the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] 's counter-terrorism coordination body ( known by its [MISC French  ] acronym - UCLAT ) , categorically reconfirmed to [LOC PolOff  ] on November 15 , " we ( the [MISC GoF  ] ) have not found any link between [MISC Islamic  ] extremists and those fomenting the unrest . 
He acknowledged that police and internal intelligence organizations have received " a few " signs that some [MISC Islamic  ] extremists have participated in the violence . 
That said , he believed that they were acting as individuals and not as members of a coordinated , [MISC Islamic  ] group . 
Fears of extremist and criminal exploitation -------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Chaboud  ] reported that [MISC GoF  ] monitoring of websites and blogs ( in [LOC France  ] and abroad ) nonetheless reveals that extremists are trying to exploit the unrest to their advantage , claiming ( for example ) that it results from [ORG GOF  ] attempts to control and muzzle [MISC Islam  ] in [LOC France  ] . 
Asked whether there was any connection between organized criminal gangs and [MISC Islamic  ] extremists in exploiting the unrest , [PER Chaboud  ] said those in the " revolt movement " were , at most , only petty criminals . 
Indeed , police are quoted in press as observing that where organized crime is strongest is often where there has been , counter to conventional expectations , little unrest , presumably because drug-selling organizations view burning cars as bad for business . 
( See also ref C for the views of a investigating judge on the connection between criminality and current unrest . 
) Just hoodlums ? -------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Samira Cadasse  ] , vice-president of a leading women 's rights group that focuses on empowering women in poor immigrant communities , told [LOC PolOff  ] that the small groups of youths responsible for car burnings and police taunting are the same ones who " hold hostage " suburban housing projects throughout [LOC France  ] . 
[PER Cadasse  ] 's NGO -- " [ORG Ni Putes Ni Soumises  ] ( [ORG NPNS  ] -- translated literally as " Neither Whores nor Submissives " ) focuses on the difficulties poor , often [MISC Muslim  ] women of immigrant background face in resisting discrimination from [MISC French  ] society as well as oppression within their own cultural traditions . 
[PER Cadasse  ] said [ORG NPNS  ] has tried to highlight for years the way frustrated , angry , aimless young men in poor neighborhoods , under the blind eye of [MISC French  ] authorities , visit their powerlessness first and foremost on their female relatives . 
Or " [MISC Islamic  ] " hoodlums ? ---------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Contrary to much of the media reporting , [PER Cadasse  ] said she definitely also perceived an [MISC Islamist  ] element behind some of the violence . 
Exclaiming that , " we all know who these guys are , " she claimed they had shaved their ( [MISC Islamic  ] ) beards in order to spread violence . 
These unemployed [MISC Islamist  ] youths were the same troublemakers who had sought to repress women in the troubled suburban neighborhoods . 
She also believed it significant that there were no girls among the troublemakers . 
That said , while [PER Cadasse  ] clearly believed that the misapplication of tenets some attribute to [MISC Islam  ] abets the widespread oppression of women in these immigrant communities , she stopped well short of calling the " big brothers " committed [MISC Islamist  ] fundamentalists . 
No role models or jobs ---------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Cadasse  ] identified lack of jobs as the real root of the problem , which was compounded by the relative generosity of the social safety net . 
As a result , young men sat idle at home , while receiving a generous -- but ultimately insufficient and humiliating -- 950-euro stipend from the government . 
They could not afford to move away from their parents , but at the same time accepted no parental control . 
She did not think it accurate to portray these youths as victims ; these young men were guilty of arson and other crimes and should be punished . 
At the same time , she thought it would be difficult to break the vicious cycle . 
[PER Cadasse  ] saw the current crisis -- due to larger failures and shortfalls in education , employment opportunities and housing -- as very difficult to resolve , and doubted that the government had the will do go beyond the " [MISC Band-Aid  ] " solutions employed in the past . 
30 years of " ghettoization " --------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) According to [PER Cadasse  ] , the government 's history of treating only the symptoms rather than the causes of minority unemployment and social exclusion , and its failure to curb a thirty-year ghettoization trend among [MISC French  ] immigrant communities , " has been an error " of governments of both left and right . 
[PER Cadasse  ] was pessimistic about the prospects of bettering the circumstances of [LOC France  ] 's immigrants of [MISC Arab  ] background . 
She said that overall , " we're no better off than 22 years ago " -- at the time of the " march of the beurs " -- a turning point in [MISC North African  ] immigrant activism . 
While she did not envision a " [PER Marshall  ] plan " for [LOC France  ] 's inner-city-like suburbs , she believed that " drastic measures " were necessary nonetheless . 
PM de [PER Villepin  ] 's pledge to reverse the budget cuts to associations ( like [ORG NPNS  ] ) and to offer a range of other social program enhancements was a positive start . 
Government funding was also critical for secular [ORG NGOs  ] like [ORG NPNS  ] to combat the influence of [MISC Islamists  ] . 
But she doubted the government had the will to stay the course . 
In her view , it was too tempting for the government to focus on security in an attempt to appeal to far-right-leaning voters in the upcoming presidential election. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: [MISC French  ] [ORG NGOs  ] are largely dependent on government support , and typically receive 80 percent or more of their funding from the state . 
These associations are essential to holding together the social fabric of poor neighborhoods , providing everything from food kitchens to tutoring to psychological support activities . 
Soon after President [PER Chirac  ] 's re-election in 2002 , the state financing of these associations was cut severely . 
Prime Minister [PER Villepin  ] last week promised to restore the cuts . 
The government appears to understand that diminishing the viability of these secular , state-funded charitable organization risks a vacuum that could be filled by home grown , [MISC Islamist  ] self-help organizations . 
End Comment . 
[ORG GOF  ] guilty of using religion ? ----------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Interestingly , some see the government itself as guilty to some degree of having violated the principle of secularism it holds so dear . 
In a meeting with the rector of the [MISC Grand Mosque of Lyon  ] on November 15 , one [MISC Muslim  ] religious leader 's criticized the government for violating [LOC France  ] 's strict separation of the religious and the public . 
The [ORG Rector  ] , [PER Kamel Kabtane  ] , took to task the government 's effort to use [MISC Muslim  ] religious figures to calm the situation in troubled neighborhoods . 
[PER Kabtane  ] said that many of his fellow-clerics were also ambivalent about the [MISC French  ] government 's call on religious leaders to " do the work of the government and security forces . 
" " If farmers started protesting " , said the [ORG Rector  ] , " the government wouldn't call on the Archbishop to resolve the situation . 
" He warned against attributing a religious dimension to socio-economic problems ; there was a risk it could become a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
Better ecumenical than Muslim-only ---------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Kabtane  ] went on to point out that , " the government says that [LOC France  ] is a secular state , but then -- when it serves its purposes to do so -- it turns around and calls on religious leaders to solve non-religious problems that the secular state should have been addressing over the last 20-30 years . 
" [PER Kabtane  ] has not issued a statement condemning the violence or calling upon the perpetrators to stop , as he believes it is important not to conflate the actions of violent youths with [MISC Islam  ] . 
If religious leaders are to be involved , he believes it would be preferable to adopt an ecumenical rather than a sectarian approach . 
To that end , he was organizing a meeting of religious leaders from the [MISC Muslim  ] , [MISC Christian  ] , and [MISC Jewish  ] communities in [LOC Lyon  ] on November <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
His aim was to convince those present to issue a joint statement condemning the violence and calling for it to end . 
The risk of an anti-Muslim backlash ----------------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Kabtane  ] indicated that he was much more worried about backlash against [MISC Muslims  ] following on the recent unrest than about any putative use of the unrest by fundamentalists . 
On November 12 , a [MISC Molotov  ] cocktail was thrown over the wall into the [MISC Grand Mosque of Lyon  ] . 
Then on November 13 , someone threw a [MISC Molotov  ] cocktail over the wall of a mosque in [LOC Saint-Chamond  ] ( a town near [LOC Lyon  ] ) . 
[PER Kabtane  ] said that [MISC Muslims  ] were paying the price for the fact that [MISC French  ] politicians -- and foreign media -- have blamed the violence on " [MISC Muslims  ] " and " immigrants " instead of on " unemployed " or " underprivileged " youths . 
( Comment: We have now heard reports of a handful of such attacks against mosques . 
In all likelihood , they were perpetrated by right-wing , anti-immigrant nativists . 
End Comment . 
) [PER Kabtane  ] added that he was satisfied with the demonstrations of support he had received from [MISC French  ] authorities in the wake of the attack on the mosque . 
The local prefect visited the site the following morning , and Interior Minister [PER Sarkozy  ] had telephoned [PER Kabtane  ] to offer support . 
The [MISC French  ] school system as the key ----------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During a public affairs talk show on the evening of November 13 , conservative philosopher [PER Alain Finkelkraut  ] addressed how " the [MISC Republic  ] " could reclaim the troubled , inner-city-like neighborhoods " lost " to both law and order and social integration . 
[PER Finkelkraut  ] poetically evoked his experience in [LOC France  ] 's public school system , stressing its role in separating youths from surrounding society in order better to inculcate the values that underpin the " [MISC Republican  ] ideal " of equal citizenship blind to race , nationality , religion and social class . 
[PER Finkelkraut  ] lamented the way " society had invaded the schools , " bringing with it a raft of demands , identities , exceptions and resentments that , taken together , interfered with the inculcation of a shared national identity . 
In [PER Finkelkraut  ] 's view , taking back the neighborhoods for " [MISC Republican  ] " law and order was the lesser half of the battle . 
Providing , to those most removed from the possibility of it , the convictions and opportunities required for successfully integrating into [MISC French  ] society was the more difficult , and most urgent challenge , facing [LOC France  ] today . 
Otherwise sectarianism could follow ----------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Finkelkraut  ] warned that failure to meet this challenge would inevitably open the door to the ascendancy of separate , alternative identities focused on religion . 
Controversial [MISC Islamic  ] activist [PER Tarik Ramadan  ] , who also participated in the round-table discussion , indirectly confirmed as much . 
Turning around the image of " the [MISC Republic  ] needing to take back the neighborhoods " , [PER Ramadan  ] , unctuously , but deftly , argued for the right of " the neighborhoods " -- their cultures , identities , religion , etc. -- to " take the [MISC Republic  ] . 
" The [MISC French  ] fear of " communitarism " ---------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Former Prime Minister [PER Alain Juppe  ] -- spending a semester teaching in [LOC Canada  ] -- posted a long piece to his blog ( www.al1jup.com ) that clearly identified " [PER Islam  ] in [LOC France  ] , " specifically " radical [PER Islam  ] , " as a factor also " responsible " for the current unrest . 
In [PER Juppe  ] 's view , " [MISC French  ] [PER Islam  ] 's " refusal -- so far -- to " solemnly proclaim " its acceptance of the " separation of the temporal from the spiritual " and its recognition of " non-negotiable , universal human rights " ( including gender equality ) contributes to the difficulty of integrating those who live in the neighborhoods where radical [PER Islam  ] presents itself as an alternative model for social organization . 
Comment ------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The gangs of underclass youths who are the perpetrators of the car burnings and urban violence in [LOC France  ] are not [MISC Islamists  ] , nor are they at all motivated by religion . 
It is highly misleading to characterize them -- as is often done in media coverage -- as " insurgent " and " [MISC Muslim  ] " youths . 
The anger felt by these youths stems from how they are trapped and without a future -- facing pervasive racial prejudice , and without the skills and education needed to get-a-life of employment and conventional respect. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) That said , the dominant religion in [LOC France  ] 's low-income housing projects affected by the recent violence is [PER Islam  ] , and there are those intent on " saving " these communities from their social ills by re-founding them on religious , as opposed to secular , principles , in effect filling the vacuum where [MISC French  ] republican values have failed to take root . 
Whether or not [MISC Islamic  ] organizations and fundamentalist proselytizing will make significant inroads among the inhabitants of [LOC France  ] 's immigrant suburbs of course depends on the effectiveness of the [ORG GOF  ] 's social programs and the willingness of [MISC French  ] society at large to face up to its pervasive prejudices against [MISC Blacks  ] and [MISC Arabs  ] .
