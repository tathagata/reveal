( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Spanish  ] government officials and press followed the [LOC U.S.  ] financial turmoil closely during the week . 
President [PER Zapatero  ] and Second Vice President and [ORG Economy  ] and Finance Minister [PER Solbes  ] reassured [MISC Spaniards  ] that [LOC Spain  ] 's financial sector was safe and its financial firms solvent . 
[PER Zapatero  ] claimed that the turmoil proved that the [LOC U.S.  ] subprime mortgage crisis was the origin of [LOC Spain  ] 's difficulties . 
[PER Solbes  ] later acknowledged that [LOC Spain  ] 's housing and inflation problems predated the international credit crisis but said they would have been manageable without the credit crisis . 
Some of [PER Zapatero  ] 's political allies described USG actions as proving the inadequacy of unregulated markets and the value of economic intervention. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Solbes'  ] ministry announced that [MISC Spanish  ] financial firms had only limited direct exposure to [ORG Lehman Brothers  ] . 
62 insurance companies had 281 million euros in exposure , 0.2% of the sector 's total exposure . 
45 pension funds had exposure totaling 0.07% of assets , and investment funds had 300 million euros in [ORG Lehman  ] bonds or shares , 0.13% of the sector 's assets . 
[PER Solbes  ] and visiting [MISC European  ] Commissioner for Economic and [ORG Monetary Affairs  ] [PER Joaquin Almunia  ] called for more centralized [ORG EU  ] financial supervision . 
( All Media ) 2009 Budget to be Austere <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Secretary of State for [LOC Treasury  ] and Budget [PER Carlos Ocana  ] announced September 18 that because of lower-than-expected growth , the 2009 budget will be more restrictive than the [ORG GOS  ] had anticipated in June . 
Press reports suggest that the 2009 budget proposal the [ORG GOS  ] is negotiating with parliamentary groups will include a deficit of 2% of GDP . 
( [ORG Europa Press  ] , 9/18 ; [ORG El Pais  ] 9/17 ) [ORG Immigrant Return Incentive Approved  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [ORG Council of Ministers  ] approved Labor Minister [PER Corbacho  ] 's proposal to allow unemployed immigrants to obtain all of their unemployment benefit if they agree to leave the country and not return for three years . 
Immigrants from the 19 non-EU countries that have [ORG Social Security  ] agreements with [LOC Spain  ] will be able to participate , receiving 40% of the benefit in [LOC Spain  ] and the remaining 60% a month later in their country of origin . 
Of the 165,000 immigrants registered as unemployed in July , over half were from either [LOC Ecuador  ] or [LOC Morocco  ] . 
The incentive must be reviewed by the [ORG Council of State  ] before it can take effect . 
( [ORG El Pais  ] , 9/19 ; [ORG Council of Ministers  ] , 9/19 ) [ORG Energy Commission Fears Problems Unless GOS Increases Electricity Charges  ] <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) According to the [ORG National Energy Commission  ] ( [ORG CNE  ] ) , if the [ORG GOS  ] does not drastically increase electricity tariffs , then it runs the risk of accruing an additional debt of up to 5 billion euros in 2009 to add to the 9 billion it already has with electricity companies . 
Under [LOC Spain  ] 's partially liberalized electricity price system , tariffs for the captive markets are set by the government . 
Companies that serve this portion of the market often must sell electricity to consumers below cost , producing a deficit that runs into billions of euros which the [ORG GOS  ] is obliged to reimburse . 
With a deficit of 9 billion ( partially financed by private banks ) , the [ORG CNE  ] fears that additional debt may incur serious financial difficulties . 
Energy Secretary-General [PER Pedro Marin  ] MADRID 00001003 002 OF 002 told reporters that the next tariff increase would not take place until January . 
Comment: Given [LOC Spain  ] , s economic woes and rising unemployment , the [ORG GOS  ] will find it politically difficult to raise electricity prices by too much . 
The [ORG GOS  ] , which has been under pressure from the [ORG European Commission  ] to abolish regulated tariffs and from the [ORG CNE  ] to raise tariffs , has said in the past that it needs several years to raise regulated prices enough to bring them fully in line with costs . 
Recent [ORG GOS  ] tariff increases have been above the rate of inflation but below [ORG CNE  ] requests . 
( Expansion , 9/18 ; [ORG ABC  ] , 9/17 , Embassy ) [ORG GOS  ] on Track to [ORG Implement Radiation Detection Maritime Portals  ] by Late 2009 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [MISC Spanish  ] Customs officials told a [ORG DOE Megaports  ] visiting team and Emboff September 15 that the [ORG GOS  ] was on schedule to install radiation detection portals at the maritime ports of [LOC Valencia  ] and [LOC Barcelona  ] by late 2009 . 
The [ORG GOS  ] will shortly solicit bids from companies interested in undertaking this [MISC Megaports  ] project at each port . 
The bidding and award process is expected to take 6 months , followed by the construction and installation , which is expected to take up to 9 months . 
The visiting [ORG DOE Megaports  ] team was in [LOC Madrid  ] September 15 to add final technical suggestions to the [ORG RFP  ] document prepared by [MISC Spanish  ] Customs . 
Comment: The only obstacle the [ORG GOS  ] may face in implementing [ORG Megaports  ] may be the upcoming year , s budget , which is expected to be strained given the current economic woes . 
( Embassy ) [ORG Vodafone  ] Launches 670 [MISC Million Euro Suit Against Telefonica Subsidiary  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Vodafone  ] has filed suit against [ORG Telefonica  ] Moviles de [LOC Espana  ] in [MISC Spanish  ] court ( 1st instance court in [LOC Madrid  ] ) demanding reparation in the amount of 670 million euros . 
[ORG Vodafone  ] asserts that [ORG Telefonica  ] abused its dominant position in the mobile phone market between 1995-1999 , blocking [ORG Vodafone  ] , s [ORG Airtel  ] from gaining access to its network and ultimately blocking [ORG Airtel  ] from hundreds of millions of euros in profits . 
According to the [MISC Spanish  ] press , [ORG Vodafone  ] , s suit builds on the 2006 [ORG Supreme Tribunal  ] , s decision that determined that between 1996-1999 , [ORG Telefonica  ] engaged in conduct that blocked or hindered [ORG Airtel  ] , s access to the network , conduct which did not comply with [LOC Spain  ] , s law against anti-competitive practices ( [ORG Ley de Defensa de Competencia  ] ) .This is the largest judicial suit presented in [LOC Spain  ] against a [MISC Spanish  ] multinational company . 
( [ORG El Pais  ] , 9/15 ) [ORG Sabadell Sells Half of Insurance Business  ] for 750M Euros <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) [ORG Banco Sabadell  ] , [LOC Spain  ] 's sixth largest banking institution , will sell half of its insurance business to [LOC Zurich  ] [ORG Vida  ] for 750 million euros plus the possibility of up to another 150 million euros over ten years , depending on the evolution of future business . 
[ORG Sabadell  ] is following other [MISC Spanish  ] banks that have sold or are studying selling part of their insurance business to raise funds . 
Comment: [LOC Spain  ] 's financial press gave this action very little coverage , which suggests that it was not a panic sale . 
[ORG Sabadell  ] 's stock price is down 40% from its peak of last year , but that is actually less of a drop than most [MISC Spanish  ] banks have suffered .
