( C ) The Government of [LOC Cuba  ] has offered no official reaction to President [PER Obama’s  ] June 4 speech in [LOC Cairo  ] . 
Former president [PER Fidel Castro  ] , however , previewed his interest in the [LOC Cairo  ] speech in a Reflection article on June 6 that he started with “Yesterday afternoon , while I was carefully analyzing [PER Obama’s  ] address at the [MISC Muslim  ] university in [MISC Cairo...”  ] ( Note: Fidel’s June 6 Reflection was devoted principally to linking the June 4 arrest in the [LOC United States  ] of [LOC Kendall  ] and [PER Gwendolyn Meyers  ] for espionage related charges to the June 3 OAS resolution regarding [LOC Cuba  ] . 
End Note . 
) Fidel’s subsequent Reflection on June 9 will only add to speculation from our civil society and diplomatic contacts that [PER Fidel  ] is obsessed with President [PER Obama.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Fidel’s latest , lengthy ( 3,500 words ) Reflection focused entirely on the [LOC Cairo  ] speech , including pages worth of short excerpts from the speech itself . 
[PER Fidel  ] split the speech into two sections . 
[PER Fidel  ] mostly sympathized with POTUS - in his own way - regarding the first section , which included the fact that the [LOC U.S.  ] is not at war with [MISC Islam  ] , the [MISC Israel-Palestine  ] issue , and [LOC Iran  ] and nuclear weapons . 
Specifically , [PER Fidel  ] said , “One cannot blame the new president of the [LOC United States  ] for the situation created in the [LOC Middle East...He  ] takes office at an exceptionally complex time for his country and the world...It is still too early to pass judgment on his degree of commitment to the ideas he presents...” [PER Fidel  ] then continued his attempts to walk a thin line between a positive impression of a popular [LOC U.S.  ] president and the idea that the evil empire will never change . 
For example , [PER Fidel  ] explained that “the current president’s main difficulty lies in the fact that the principles he is advocating contradict the policy the superpower has pursued for almost seven decades...” [PER Fidel  ] also renewed his insistence that the [LOC United States  ] is a racist country by adding that “Not even [PER Obama  ] could imagine when he was working in the black communities of [LOC Chicago  ] that the terrible effects of a financial crisis would combine with the factors that made his election as president in a strongly racist society possible.” <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Fidel  ] referred to the second section of the speech on the topics of democracy , religious freedom , and women’s rights as the moment when “Obama starts philosophizing and lecturing about [LOC U.S.  ] foreign policy.” [PER Fidel  ] targets the line in the speech “No system of government can or should be imposed by one nation on any other” and argues that it was followed by [PER Obama  ] immediately contradicting himself “with a declaration of faith that turns the [LOC United States  ] into the supreme judge over democratic values and human rights.” Overall , [PER Fidel  ] said the speech “would appear to be a public relations campaign carried out by the [LOC United States  ] with the [MISC Muslim  ] countries ; in any case , this is better than threatening to destroy them with bombs.” [PER Fidel  ] ends his article by calling POTUS a “very good communicator” , highlighting the ecumenical breadth of the speech , and complimenting [PER Obama  ] on his “impressive working capacity.” <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG U.S. Interests Section  ] ( [ORG USINT  ] ) posted a video of the speech , a link to the [MISC America.gov  ] website covering the speech , and a [MISC Spanish  ] translation on our homepage . 
[ORG USINT  ] is distributing a [MISC Spanish  ] copy of the speech to [MISC Cuban  ] Muslims and other contacts in civil society and the diplomatic community . 
The [LOC Cairo  ] speech was not available to [MISC Cubans  ] through the official [MISC Cuban  ] media , and only excerpts of Fidel’s Reflections were read on the radio and television . 
This is not the first time Fidel’s Reflection was the first official source of information regarding a significant world or domestic event . 
He frequently provides the only snippets of President [PER Obama’s  ] speeches available to [MISC Cubans  ] outside of [MISC USINT’s  ] reach . 
( Note: [ORG Today’s Communist Party  ] newspaper [ORG Granma  ] notes that tonight’s roundtable television program will discuss , among other things , [PER Obama’s  ] recent trip to the [LOC Middle East  ] .
