( [ORG SBU  ] ) SUMMARY . 
The Government of [LOC Brazil  ] ( [ORG GOB  ] ) had another bad month in August in its efforts to reduce the rate of deforestation: the rate more than tripled compared to August 2007 . 
Against this backdrop , the Environment Minister [PER Carlos Minc  ] announced twelve additional measures to reinforce the [ORG GOB  ] 's efforts to combat deforestation . 
Most notably , [PER Minc  ] released a list of the top one hundred contributors to deforestation , with a promise to take legal action against them . 
This step stirred up a controversy because at the top of the list was the [ORG Brazilian Land Settlement Agency  ] ( [ORG INCRA  ] ) , which resettles the landless . 
At around the same time , the [ORG GOB  ] released for public comment a proposed [ORG National Plan on Climate Change  ] ( [ORG SEPTEL  ] ) , which calls for reducing the rate of " illegal " deforestation to zero and eliminating the " net " loss of the area of forest coverage by 2015 . 
During this same period , [PER Minc  ] acceded to demands from the agriculture lobby to water down tough changes to strengthen the [ORG National Environmental Crimes Law  ] proposed by his predecessor , Minister [PER Marina Silva  ] . 
This has provoked sharp criticisms from some in the environmental community , especially from former Minister [PER Silva  ] . 
[PER Minc  ] did succeed in persuading the [ORG Agriculture Ministry  ] to exclude the [LOC Amazon  ] and some other sensitive areas from the planting of sugar cane in a new zoning regulation to be released . 
END SUMMARY YET ANOTHER BAD MONTH FOR FIGHTING DEFORESTATION <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) ON September 29 , the [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG National Space Research Institute  ] ( [ORG INPE  ] ) announced the amount of deforestation for the month of August: 756 square kilometers . 
Environment Minister [PER Carlos Minc  ] - not one to sugarcoat matters - exclaimed , " The numbers are just terrible . 
" The August 2008 figure represents a 228 percent increase compared to the amount of forest cleared in the same month for the previous year , i.e. , 230 square kilometers . 
Further , the August figure is more than twice that for July , i.e. , 323 square kilometers . 
The northern state of [LOC Para  ] was responsible for almost 60 percent of the total forest clearing in [LOC August.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG INPE  ] is expected to release its annual rate of deforestation later this year , which uses more precise and reliable data than that employed for monthly rates . 
Expectations are that the annual rate will be significantly higher than the 11,532 square kilometers cleared in the September 2006-August 2007 annual period . 
TWELVE NEW MEASURES <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In response to the bleak numbers in August and earlier months , [PER Minc  ] announced twelve new measures to step up efforts to reduce deforestation . 
Most notably , he released a list of the top 100 illegal deforesters , with a promise to work with federal prosecutors to take legal action against the culprits . 
The other measures are: - The creation of a new federal task force to fight deforestation and combat environmental crimes . 
This unit will have three thousand officials , two thousand working with [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG Environmental Agency  ] ( [ORG IBAMA  ] ) and one thousand with the [ORG Institute Chico Mendes  ] , which manages conservation areas ; - The launching of law enforcement operations in the second half of October 2008 to expel illegal loggers from the national forests in the north-western state of [LOC Rondonia.  ] - An intention to work with state governments in the [LOC Amazon  ] to develop their state-level plans for combating deforestation , which is a precondition for obtaining financial support from the new national [ORG Amazon Fund  ] ( [ORG REFTEL  ] ) . - The creation of six new check points / monitoring stations on the principal highways through the [LOC Amazon  ] to deter the transportation of illegal wood and charcoal. - The formation of an inter-ministerial committee for fighting deforestation that will define strategies and actions , which will be composed of representatives from six different ministries ; - The development of a system for issuing of federal [ORG Forest Origin Documents  ] , which should help deter fraud in the logging sector ; The setting up of a [ORG Forest District  ] along the north-south [MISC BR-163  ] highway ( [LOC Cuiaba-Santarem  ] ) to better control and protect the region ( this project will be financed through six million [MISC Euros  ] donated by the [ORG European Union  ] ) ; - The creation of a working group to designate conservation units along the length of the north-south [MISC BR-319  ] ( [PER Porto Velho-Manaus  ] ) highway , which is undergoing upgrades and completion of the paving process ; - The revision of the national Program for the [ORG Prevention and Combating of Deforestation  ] ( [ORG PPCDAM  ] ) with the aim of strengthening efforts along the so-called [ORG Arc of Fire  ] , where most of the deforestation is occurring ; - The equalization of rights of mining communities with those of settlers in communities established by the [ORG Brazilian Land Settlement Agency  ] ( [ORG INCRA  ] ) , and release the first management plan for an [ORG INCRA  ] settlement in [LOC Rondonia.  ] - The organization of workshops in states to facilitate the licensing of rural settlements and the recuperation of [ORG Mining Reserves  ] and [ORG Permanently Protected Areas  ] . 
BRAZIL'S WORST OFFENDER ? 
THE GOVERNMENT OF [LOC BRAZIL  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Minc  ] 's list of the nation 's top one hundred deforesters immediately caused a political storm because at the top of the list of offenders was the Government of [LOC Brazil  ] itself , namely , [ORG INCRA  ] . 
Initially , [PER Minc  ] said that criminal charges would be opened against all the main deforesters . 
( NOTE: [PER Minc  ] tried to defuse the political mess by saying he had released the list without reading it first and , to make matters even worse , claimed that the list had been prepared by his predecessor [PER Marina Silva  ] . 
END NOTE ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG INCRA  ] 's President [PER Rolf Hackbart  ] pushed back . 
He challenged the inclusion of [ORG INCRA  ] on the list saying that the data used to prepare it was from 1998 and completely obsolete . 
Subsequently , [PER Minc  ] promised to have the list reviewed . 
He further announced that in talks with [ORG INCRA  ] it was determined that instead of taking any legal actions against [ORG INCRA  ] , [ORG INCRA  ] would turn over to the [ORG Environment Ministry  ] an unspecified amount of land ( in a place to be named later ) as compensation . 
For the others on the list , [PER Minc  ] said that his ministry would work with prosecutors to bring criminal charges and/or seek heavy fines . 
PROPOSED NATIONAL PLAN ON CLIMATE CHANGE <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Around this same time , on September 30 , the [ORG Environment Ministry  ] released for public comment a proposed [ORG National Plan  ] on [ORG Climate Change  ] ( [ORG SEPTEL  ] ) . 
The proposed plan addresses the problem of deforestation . 
It calls for , among other actions , measures to reduce the " illegal " deforestation rate to zero , as well as achieving a sustainable decrease in the overall deforestation rate . 
In addition , the plan proposes to eliminate the " net " loss of the area of forest coverage by 2015 . 
Key to the plan is reforestation and developing tree plantations ( such as eucalyptus , which would produce wood for making coal ) . 
The final version of the plan should be ready to be presented at the [ORG UN Climate Change Conference  ] to take place in [LOC Poznan  ] , [LOC Poland  ] , December 1-12 , 2008 . 
CHANGES TO ENVIRONMENTAL CRIME LAWS ---------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On October 8 , 2008 , [PER Minc  ] announced his revision to changes proposed earlier by his predecessor , Min . 
[PER Marina Silva  ] , to the country 's [ORG Environmental Crime Law  ] . 
The earlier version would have imposed tough requirements on farmers and ranchers in the [LOC Amazon  ] region , and the [ORG Ministry of Agriculture  ] had objected . 
[PER Minc  ] essentially split the difference between the agriculture and the environmental communities . 
The main changes refer to the time frame farmers will have to bring their properties into compliance with the requirements to maintain a forest reserve of 80 percent . 
Also , the changes would reduce the penalties for non-compliance . 
Instead of denying benefits to a farmer for all the land in question for non-compliance , the penalties - such as a cutoff of government credits - would only the non-compliant portion . 
The proposed text still has to go the President for approval before going to [ORG Congress  ] . 
The [ORG Congress  ] has a powerful rural contingent that may seek to further amend the bill or just kill it. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) During a [ORG Senate  ] hearing , [PER Minc  ] was heavily criticized by his predecessor , now Senator [PER Marina Silva  ] , who said that by changing [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001378 003.2 OF 003 the current legislation the country is creating an even bigger problem for the environment . 
[PER Silva  ] also criticized [PER Minc  ] 's permission for the planting of biofuel crops in already degraded areas of the [LOC Amazon Forest  ] . 
NEW ZONING PLAN <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG Environment Ministry  ] has been working with the [ORG Agriculture Ministry  ] on developing a new zoning plan to govern sugarcane . 
[PER Minc  ] and Agriculture Minister [PER Reinhold Stephanes  ] announced that the plan would be ready later this year . 
According to both ministers , the only pending part of the report refers to whether or not sugarcane planting will be allowed in the high plateaus of the [LOC Pantanal  ] region . 
[PER Minc  ] anticipated the results by saying that the studies have identified 65 million hectares of possible sugarcane planting lands outside the [LOC Pantanal  ] and [ORG Amazon Biomes  ] . 
The area also excludes land with native vegetation coverage in any of the country 's biomes , as well as sloped land where mechanical planting cannot be used and therefore the use of fire would be considered necessary. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) " All we have to do now is choose six million hectares out of the total 65 , so that we can meet our goals established in the [ORG National Climate Change Plan  ] for the production of ethanol " , said [PER Minc  ] during the hearing . 
The Plan establishes an eleven percent yearly increase in ethanol production in order to bring down CO2 emissions . 
COMMENT <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Environment Minister [PER Minc  ] has injected new energy and greater pragmatism into the GOB 's efforts to reduce the high deforestation rate . 
He doesn't shy from admitting problems with the current efforts , and he is willing to try new measures . 
Further , [PER Minc  ] has shown his pragmatism by working with the [ORG Agriculture Ministry  ] even when it draws the ire of environmentalists or his predecessor [PER Marina Silva  ] . 
This is reflected in the proposed [ORG National Plan  ] on [ORG Climate Change  ] , which envisions halting " net " loss of forest coverage at the same time that it includes reforestation and tree plantations as tools ( an anathema to some in the environment community ) . 
END COMMENT .
