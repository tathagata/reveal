End summary. -------------------------- Tide Needs Turning in [LOC Iraq  ] -------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On an April 5 visit , Commandant of the [ORG Marine Corps  ] General [PER James Conway  ] met with Crown Prince [PER Shaikh Salman Bin Hamad Al Khalifa  ] , who said that he had been watching the situation in [LOC Iraq  ] closely , especially the activities of Commander of the [ORG Multinational Force in Iraq  ] General [PER David Petraeus  ] . 
He commended General [PER Petraeus  ] for his clear commitment to the mission in [LOC Iraq  ] , including his “Marhaba , shabab” ( Hello , youth ) statement . 
The “tide needs to be turned , ” the [ORG CP  ] said , and security forces need to find those responsible for the violence and stop them . 
General [PER Conway  ] said that there has been incremental progress , including with some [MISC Sunni  ] tribes in [LOC Anbar  ] province , some of whom are turning away from [PER Al Qaida  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] ( [MISC AQI  ] ) because of its brutal tactics and abuse of some [MISC Sunni  ] tribal leaders. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Regarding [LOC U.S.  ] troop levels in [LOC Iraq  ] , the [ORG CP  ] advised reducing troop levels as soon as possible in urban areas , with the exception of [LOC Baghdad  ] , and moving the troops to outlying areas . 
He stressed the importance of keeping the borders secure , but counseled to let [MISC Iraqis  ] begin to sort out the security situation . 
Admittedly there will be a rise in violence between people who want to “settle scores , ” but after six months the situation will calm down . 
The [MISC Iraqi  ] military needs to take over more responsibility , and it will grow to fill its role . 
Similarly [MISC Iraqi  ] leaders need to increase their initiative and leadership over its people , demonstrating a sense of common purpose . 
When asked by General [PER Conway  ] whether he had expressed these ideas to [LOC U.S.  ] Defense Secretary [PER Gates  ] , the [ORG CP  ] said that he had and that Secretary [PER Gates  ] had listened carefully . 
The [ORG CP  ] said that he SIPDIS had experienced difficulty previously trying to convince [LOC U.S.  ] policy-makers who still believed [LOC Iraq  ] could be a model of democracy in the region , but Secretary [PER Gates  ] had not dismissed his ideas . 
[PER Shaikh Salman  ] said , “Iraq will not be a model of democracy , at least not in the next 10-15 years.” <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [ORG CP  ] said that [LOC Iraq  ] needs a strong federal government with 18 provinces . 
Splitting the country into three areas by sects is the wrong thing to do , because the country will eventually fall apart . 
He said [LOC Iraq  ] needs a strong civilian government backed by the military , referring to [LOC Turkey  ] as a model . 
He also said that total de-Baathification was the wrong approach , but that there needed to be efforts to root out militia members from the security forces . 
[PER Shaikh Salman  ] stated that Prime Minister [PER Al Maliki  ] may not be the right leader for the job in the long run , “but he is the guy for now . 
It was unrealistic to expect that merely a single election cycle could take [LOC Iraq  ] from [LOC Saddam  ] to stability.” The [ORG CP  ] offered Bahrain’s support in any way it could assist. ------------------ Concern About [LOC Iran  ] ------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Shaikh Salman  ] expressed his concern about domestic [LOC MANAMA  ] 00000336 002 OF 002 problems in [LOC Iran  ] , including the poor state of the economy , which increases desperation , and the corresponding danger , of the [MISC Iranian  ] government . 
He said he was worried about a nuclear-armed [LOC Iran  ] , as it would likely spark a nuclear arms race in the [LOC Gulf  ] . 
The [ORG CP  ] focused on [ORG Iran’s  ] consistent activity around the world spreading violence and unrest , including [ORG Iran’s  ] support of [ORG Hizbullah  ] , [ORG Hamas  ] , militias in [LOC Iraq  ] , and extremists in [LOC Indonesia  ] . 
[LOC Iran  ] is also trying to build networks in [LOC Bahrain  ] , so the [MISC Bahraini  ] security services are working diligently to contain and disrupt their activities . 
[ORG Iran’s  ] policies to spread the revolution have nothing to do with being [PER Shia  ] , but everything to do with its [MISC Persian  ] identity . 
The [MISC Iranians  ] want to project their [MISC Persian  ] identity across the entire [LOC Gulf  ] . 
The [ORG CP  ] noted that coverage of the release of the 15 [MISC British  ] sailors and marines showed messages about the “Persian [LOC Gulf”  ] prominently placed on signs in the background. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The [ORG CP  ] wondered aloud how the 15 [MISC British  ] allowed themselves to be caught and why the [MISC British  ] decided against immediate action . 
He surmised that they must have been too far from their support ship . 
General [PER Conway  ] added that the [MISC British  ] seek to de-escalate tension in such incidents . 
The [ORG CP  ] quipped that sometimes there is a need for quick , strong escalation ( to send a message ) . 
He commented that [LOC Iran  ] has benefited disproportionately from the incident in terms of public relations . 
The [ORG CP  ] also said that he assumed the release of [PER Jalal Sharafi  ] , the [MISC Iranian  ] official who had been abducted in [LOC Iraq  ] , was connected to the release of the [MISC British  ] sailors , mentioning that [LOC Iran  ] has always used hostage-taking to their benefit. -------------------- Success in [LOC Singapore  ] -------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) When asked by the Ambassador about his recent trip to [LOC Singapore  ] , the [ORG CP  ] said that it was a productive visit . 
[LOC Bahrain  ] is in a similar position in terms of development and economic growth that [LOC Singapore  ] was in 20 years ago . 
Even though [LOC Singapore  ] is not close to the [LOC Middle East  ] , the [ORG CP  ] said that officials he talked with were concerned about the [MISC Islamic  ] threat . 
[MISC Singaporeans  ] live with [MISC Muslims  ] , and officials fear the ways extremist messages affect their youth . 
He had been told there are approximately 2,000 hardened , completely convinced “psychopaths , ” who have the potential to cause serious problems in [LOC Singapore  ] . 
The [ORG CP  ] said these extremists need to be handled like a cult and stopped at their source . 
He said that extremist groups often cut off their recruits from their families and friends to break their support network . 
Consequently , officials in [LOC Singapore  ] encourage parents and other family members to be heavily involved in their youths’ lives to be more in touch with their activities and prevent their mixing with extremists. ********************************************* ******** Visit Embassy Manama’s Classified Website: http://www.state.sgov.gov/p/nea/manama/ ********************************************* ******** MONROE</pre></code>
