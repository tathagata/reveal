( C ) We look forward to your visit . 
[LOC Turkey  ] is a strong ally in the [MISC Global War on Terrorism  ] ( GWOT ) , facilitating the distribution of critical supplies and fuel to the coalition in [LOC Iraq  ] and supporting the [ORG NATO Training Mission  ] ( [MISC NTM-I  ] ) there ; publicly calling on [LOC Iran  ] to comply with its [ORG IAEA  ] commitments ; and pressuring [LOC Syria  ] and [ORG Hamas  ] to renounce their support for terrorism . 
Later this year [LOC Turkey  ] will take over command of ISAF-Central ( with [LOC France  ] and [LOC Italy  ] ) and open its first Provincial Reconstruction Team ( PRT ) in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
But there are challenges . 
Bilateral defense industry cooperation is on the decline . 
An enhanced [MISC Turkish  ] security presence along the [MISC Iraqi  ] border to combat an increase in [ORG PKK  ] terrorist activity has raised concerns that [LOC Turkey  ] might act unilaterally across the border into [LOC Iraq  ] , which we have discouraged. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) [LOC Turkey  ] is a key player in a number of issues that come under your command , chiefly connected to [ORG OIF  ] and the [MISC GWOT:  ] --58% of all supplies flowing into [LOC Iraq  ] by air use the multi-directional cargo hub at [LOC Incirlik  ] Air Base. --25% of sustainment fuel for the coalition flows over the [MISC Turkey-Iraq  ] border crossing at [LOC Habur Gate  ] , as do many other key supplies for our troops downrange. --We are now in informal discussion with the GOT to use [MISC Turkish  ] roads and ports to retrograde excess equipment and material from [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Retrograding equipment via [LOC Turkey  ] would provide an additional LOC to [ORG CENTCOM  ] , relieve congestion at [LOC Kuwait  ] , and ensure a more secure route . 
You should urge the [MISC Turkish  ] General [PER Staff  ] ( [ORG TGS  ] ) to continue to work with us on this issue. --Turkey has signaled its interest in working with us on repairing [LOC Nasosnaya Air Base  ] in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] ; you should seek senior [MISC Turkish  ] military confirmation and sell them on the concept. --The [MISC Turkish  ] military had allowed us to use [LOC Incirlik  ] as a refueling stop for [ORG Operation FUNDAMENTAL JUSTICE  ] detainee movement operations since 2002 , but revoked this permission in February of this year . 
We understand [ORG OSD  ] and [ORG JCS  ] have been discussing whether to approach [LOC Turkey  ] to seek to reverse this decision . 
We recommend that you do not raise this issue with [ORG TGS  ] pending clarification from [LOC Washington  ] on what approach State/OSD/JCS/NSC wish to take . 
END SUMMARY . 
Bilateral Relationship Improving -------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) During her April 25 visit to [LOC Ankara  ] , Secretary [PER Rice  ] and FM Gul announced our intention to set up a formal and regular senior-level strategic dialogue consultative mechanism . 
The goal was to signal progress toward restoring confidence and strengthening our ability to work together in ways helpful to our goals in the region and in [LOC Turkey  ] itself . 
We are now negotiating the final touches of our “Strategic Partnership” document , which should be made public soon . 
We have restored bilateral dialogue through many senior level visits over the past ten months . 
We have shifted our dialogue on [LOC Iraq  ] from one dominated by [MISC Turkish  ] whining about the [ORG PKK  ] and Kirkk to one of constructive collaboration politically and logistically in support of our efforts there . 
A PARTNER IN GWOT ----------------- [LOC ANKARA  ] 00003352 002 OF 004 [LOC Iraq  ] ----- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Turkey’s agreement to allow the use of its territory as a logistical hub has been a crucial asset in our [LOC Iraq  ] operations . 
Two-thirds of gasoline and diesel fuel shipments ( 3 million gallons per day ) for the [MISC Iraqi  ] people and 25% of sustainment fuel for the coalition crosses into [LOC Iraq  ] through the [ORG Ground Line of Communication  ] at [LOC Habur Border Gate  ] . 
Since [LOC Turkey  ] approved the use of [LOC Incirlik  ] Air Base as a cargo hub to support coalition operations in [LOC Iraq  ] in May 2005 , over 152 million pounds of equipment has been shipped to [LOC US  ] troops . 
58% of all equipment provided to our troops in [LOC Iraq  ] by air pass through [LOC Incirlik  ] . 
Six [MISC C-17  ] aircraft now deliver from [LOC Incirlik  ] the amount of supplies it took 9-10 planes to deliver from [LOC Germany  ] . 
Additionally four [MISC KC-135  ] tanker aircraft based there since 2003 have run 2800 refueling sorties , delivering 192 million pounds of fuel in support of [ORG Operation Enduring Freedom  ] and [ORG Operation Iraqi Freedom  ] . 
[LOC Turkey  ] has four personnel assigned to [MISC NTM-I  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] and , under this rubric , has trained 57 [MISC Iraqi  ] military officers in [LOC Turkey  ] . 
[MISC Iraqis  ] have pledged to send officers to at least seven additional courses this year . 
Retrograde ------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) On behalf of [ORG CENTCOM  ] , we are informally coordinating with [ORG TGS  ] and the [ORG MFA  ] with respect to gaining Government of [LOC Turkey  ] approval to use [MISC Turkish  ] roadways and sea ports to retrograde excess equipment and material from [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Retrograding equipment via [LOC Turkey  ] provides an additional LOC to [ORG CENTCOM  ] , relieves congestion at [LOC Kuwait  ] , and is a more secure route . 
On May 26 , [ORG TGS  ] informed us that [ORG TGS  ] and [ORG MFA  ] are supportive of the retrograde concept . 
They requested that formal notification be made via diplomatic channels since the Government of [LOC Turkey  ] is the approval authority . 
Additionally , they stated that our request to be exempt from customs fees , taxes and surcharges would require further discussion with Customs officials . 
The formal notification should occur soon . 
You should express your appreciation for [MISC TGS’s  ] initial support and ask for their continued support once the formal request is presented . 
[ORG Afghanistan: Good New Story  ] --------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Turkey  ] has twice successfully led the [ORG International Security Assistance Force  ] ( [ORG ISAF  ] ) in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , most recently from February to August 2005 . 
Later this year , it will take over joint command of ISAF-Central in [LOC Kabul  ] for a two-year period , and will open its first PRT in the neighboring province of [LOC Wardak  ] . 
PM [PER Erdogan  ] visited [LOC Afghanistan  ] in spring 2005 and subsequently increased Turkey’s pledged assistance ten-fold to $100M . 
This will be allocated in $16M increments for five years to build schools , hospitals , medical clinics and drinking water wells throughout the country . 
Four hospitals have already been constructed . 
The GOT provides counter-narcotics training in [LOC Turkey  ] to [MISC Afghan  ] security forces and will initiate such training in [LOC Afghanistan  ] this year under the auspices of the [LOC Wardak  ] PRT . 
President [PER Karzai  ] demonstrated his gratitude for Turkey’s assistance by participating in a March counter-terrorism conference at [ORG Turkey’s NATO Center of Excellence  ] for the [ORG Defense Against Terrorism  ] . 
[ORG PKK  ] --- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The [ORG PKK  ] ( [ORG Kurdistan Workers Party  ] , which seeks to carve off the primarily [MISC Kurdish  ] portion of eastern [LOC Turkey  ] by force of arms ) has intensified its terrorist campaign in [LOC Turkey:  ] over 150 [MISC Turkish  ] security forces have died so far in 2006 , a dozen in the past two weeks alone . 
This violence has [LOC ANKARA  ] 00003352 003 OF 004 increased pressure on the GOT to take decisive measures to cope with the problem , including attacking [ORG PKK  ] strongholds in northern [LOC Iraq  ] , which the organization uses as a command , control , and logistics base to infiltrate [LOC Turkey  ] and carry out attacks . 
[LOC Turkey  ] wants the new government in [LOC Iraq  ] to take immediate , concrete steps to limit [ORG PKK  ] freedom of action in the country . 
The [MISC PKK’s  ] isolated location , the long list of priorities facing the [ORG GOI  ] , and the attitudes of [MISC Kurdish  ] authorities in northern [LOC Iraq  ] make this complicated. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Secretary [PER Rice  ] told GOT leaders April 25 that the [LOC U.S.  ] will reinvigorate trilateral ( [MISC U.S.-Turkey-Iraq  ] ) discussions on the issue . 
While recognizing that the insurgency prevents coalition troops from engaging the [ORG PKK  ] in [LOC Iraq  ] , the GOT remains frustrated at its inability , and [LOC U.S.  ] unwillingness , to stop attacks by people coming from the other side of its border. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( S ) If you are confronted with this issue , you can point to significant efforts the [ORG USG  ] is undertaking to ameliorate the [ORG PKK  ] threat: --Sharing of sensitive intelligence on [ORG PKK  ] activities within [LOC Turkey  ] , which have led to successful [MISC Turkish  ] COIN operations. --MNF-I surveillance flights over [ORG PKK  ] camps in northern [LOC Iraq  ] , which have also had a salutary effect interms of psyops. --An intelligence fusion cell which meets weekly in [LOC Ankara  ] to pass information to the [MISC Turkish  ] military on [ORG PKK  ] activities. --A new initiative to work with [LOC Turkey  ] on building law enforcement cases against [ORG PKK  ] operatives in [LOC Europe  ] . 
OTHER KEY ISSUES ---------------- [LOC Iran  ] ---- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S ) Secretary [PER Rice  ] personally informed Foreign Minister [PER Gul May  ] 31 of the [LOC U.S.  ] initiative to join with the [MISC EU-3  ] in negotiations with [MISC Iran’s  ] representatives once [LOC Iran  ] fully and verifiably suspends its enrichment and reprocessing activities . 
[ORG Deputy National Security Adviser Crouch  ] followed up with discussions in [LOC Ankara  ] June 4 . 
Official and public reaction to this initiative has been uniformly positive . 
The GOT has publicly supported this move and called upon the [MISC Iranians  ] to respond positively . 
[MISC Turkish  ] officials have taken a tougher line on [LOC Iran  ] since the [LOC U.S.  ] Ambassador to the [ORG IAEA  ] , [PER Greg Schulte  ] , provided in-depth briefings and consulted with [LOC Turkey  ] in February . 
[PER Gul  ] has told visiting [ORG Congressional  ] delegations that [MISC Iran’s  ] nuclear weapons aspirations are the single most important problem facing [LOC Europe  ] and the [LOC Middle East  ] , and he has emphasized the need for a united and decisive international approach . 
[LOC Ankara  ] has called on [LOC Tehran  ] to cooperate with the [ORG IAEA  ] , adopt full transparency on its nuclear programs , and resume negotiations with the [MISC EU-3  ] , most recently in [PER Erdogan  ] - [MISC Ahmadinejad  ] encounters in [LOC Baku  ] and [LOC Bali  ] and during an early May visit by [ORG Iranian National Security Adviser Larijani  ] . 
An Opening on [LOC Nasosnaya  ] ? ------------------------ <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) As part of a continuing effort in the [MISC Caucasus  ] , the [LOC U.S.  ] and allies continue to promote collective assistance to [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , [LOC Armenia  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] . 
A recent proposal -- the upgrade of [LOC Nasosnaya  ] Airfield located outside of [LOC Baku  ] -- has not taken hold with our [MISC Turkish  ] counterparts ( at least not in [LOC Ankara  ] ) . 
Over the past 2-3 years , the idea of upgrading the airfield has been briefed in several venues ( the [ORG Caucasus Working Group  ] and the [MISC South Caucasus Clearing House  ] ) . 
Additionally , the idea of a joint venture among allies to [LOC ANKARA  ] 00003352 004 OF 004 perform the upgrade has been informally sent to the [ORG TGS  ] J5 on several occasions . 
While the military has not responded to our entreaties in [LOC Ankara  ] , the [MISC Turkish  ] DATT in [LOC Baku  ] ( a one-star general ) recently told us that [LOC Turkey  ] is enthusiastic about working with us on [LOC Nasosnaya  ] . 
A push at the senior levels within [ORG TGS  ] might help break this proposal loose . 
Any interest you can promote during your visit would be beneficial . 
[ORG Defense Industry Cooperation Declining  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Defense  ] industry cooperation , once the strongest aspect of our military-to-military relationship , is in decline . 
No [LOC U.S.  ] firm has won a direct commercial sale since [ORG Boeing  ] was awarded a contract for an [MISC Airborne Early Warning  ] and Control ( [ORG AEW&C  ] ) aircraft in 2002 . 
In 2004 , three tenders ( UAVs , [LOC Main Battle  ] Tanks , and attack helicopters ) were canceled . 
Two [LOC U.S.  ] firms , [ORG Boeing  ] and [LOC Bell  ] , were interested in a second attack helicopter tender , but declined to participate due to onerous liability and technology transfer requirements . 
( Several non-US firms did submit bids . 
) [ORG Sikorsky  ] may choose not to participate in a tender for 54 utility helicopters for the [ORG Turkish Armed Forces  ] and [ORG Forestry Service  ] for the same reason , and [ORG Raytheon  ] may bow out of contention for an aircraft trainer tender . 
Both in [LOC Ankara  ] and in [LOC Washington  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] firms and the [ORG USG  ] have raised the technology transfer and liability concerns with [ORG Turkey’s Ministry of Defense  ] and [ORG Defense Industry Undersecretariat  ] ( [ORG SSM  ] ) . 
Despite both [MISC Turkish  ] military and government insistence that it wants [LOC US  ] competition in these tenders , [ORG SSM  ] has resisted making the necessary changes to the tenders to ensure it .
