( C ) Summary: Senior [ORG BP  ] officils believe that the [LOC Sangachal  ] energy terminal and offshore platforms are vulnerable to terrorism . 
As [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] President [PER Bill Schrader  ] routinely tells [LOC U.S.  ] officials , “all it would take is one guy with a mortar or six guys in a boat” to wreak havoc in [LOC Azerbaijan’s  ] critical energy infrastructure . 
Although [LOC Azerbaijan  ] has a system and plans in place to deal with security threats at its on- and offshore installations , the [ORG GOAJ’s  ] plans are hampered by a lack of resources , a lack of coordination among [ORG GOAJ  ] agencies , and a fundamental lack of recognition of the vulnerabilities . 
The [ORG GOAJ  ] is eager for [LOC U.S.  ] views on this topic and plans to present its own assessment of critical energy infrastructure security needs at the July 9-10 bilateral security consultations . 
We strongly recommend that the [ORG Department explore  ] options to help [LOC Azerbaijan  ] better assess these vulnerabilities , in line with the [ORG NATO Riga Summit  ] declaration on energy security . 
End summary . 
[ORG BP’S Views  ] on the Vulnerabilities --------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG BP  ] , the operator for the [ORG Azerbaijan International Operating Company  ] and associated [ORG Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Oil Export Pipeline  ] , believes that the [LOC Sangachal  ] terminal and [LOC Azerbaijan’s  ] off-shore platforms are vulnerable to terrorism . 
As [ORG BP Azerbaijan  ] President [PER Bill Schrader  ] has told [LOC U.S.  ] officials in private conversations , “all it would take is one guy with a mortar or six guys in a boat” to wreak havoc in [LOC Azerbaijan’s  ] critical energy infrastructure . 
The [LOC Sangachal  ] terminal , a sprawling 800-hectare site roughly 45 km south of [LOC Baku  ] , is one of the world’s largest integrated oil and gas terminals , and according to [PER Schrader  ] , the most vulnerable energy installation in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] . 
The terminal -- easily accessible from [LOC Azerbaijan’s  ] main north-south highway -- is still expanding and lacks a hard perimeter in the areas under construction . 
This , coupled with a large volume of trucks and personnel related to the construction and operations make access control and segregation inside the facility a challenge . 
[PER Schrader  ] said that an attack on the terminal , rather than the pipelines themselves , is his primary security concern , due to the catastrophic nature of the consequences. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG BP  ] also believes that the off-shore platforms are vulnerable to attack . 
As [PER Schrader  ] has repeatedly told [LOC U.S.  ] officials , “all it takes is six guys hijacking a ship and ramming it into a platform to bring production to a halt for months if not years.” Although commercial and military radars exist to give advance notice of an attack against an offshore production platform , there is no [ORG GOAJ  ] or [ORG BP  ] means of deterring such an attack . 
Discussions within the [MISC Azerbaijani  ] [ORG Navy  ] seem to be focused on pipeline vice platform security . 
The [ORG Navy  ] leadership is focused on solutions to protect the sub-sea pipeline from terrorist attacks and underwater mining . 
[ORG GOAJ  ] response capacity is hampered by a lack of resources and a lack of coordination between the [ORG Navy  ] and the [ORG Coast Guard  ] , the two [ORG GOAJ  ] entities with primary responsibility for protecting the offshore installations . 
THE [ORG GOAJ  ] SECURITY PLAN ---------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Coordination of security and contingency planning responsibility rests with the [ORG State Committee  ] to Protect Pipelines , headed by the Prime Minister . 
The commission includes Representatives from various government entities including the [ORG Special State Protection Service  ] ( [ORG SSPS  ] ) , [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] ( [ORG MOD  ] ) and [ORG Ministry of Emergency Situations  ] ( [ORG MES  ] ) . 
The commission has had an emergency action/contingency plan in place since 2002 , when it was created with the help of experts from the [ORG USG  ] and from private industry . 
( Note: In December 2002 a pipeline and structures security seminar was held in [LOC Baku  ] and included representatives from S/CT , DS ATA , [ORG EUCOM  ] , and private [LOC BAKU  ] 00000855 002.2 OF 004 industry . 
) The commission holds tabletop exercises/trainings to drill and evaluate their plan on average every six months . 
The most recent exercises were held in November 2006 and February 2007. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Responsibility for security at critical energy infrastructure sites is divided by location . 
Onshore pipelines and associated structures such as the [ORG Sangachal Terminal  ] and [ORG BTC  ] pumping stations are the responsibility of the [ORG SSPS  ] , which is also responsible for the security of the president of [LOC Azerbaijan  ] and high-ranking government officials . 
Offshore structures and pipelines are the responsibility of the [MISC Azerbaijani  ] [ORG Navy  ] and [ORG Coast Guard  ] . 
Onshore Facilities ------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Along with the pipeline operators , [ORG SSPS  ] is responsible for ensuring the security of the various pipelines in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , to include the [ORG Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan  ] ( [ORG BTC  ] ) , [MISC Western  ] , and [LOC Novorossiysk  ] ( northern ) oil pipelines , as well as the [LOC South Caucasus  ] ( [ORG SCP  ] ) gas pipeline and associated structures such as the [LOC Sangachal  ] terminal. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC Sangachal Terminal  ] is located approximately three kilometers from the [LOC Caspian  ] coast on a broad valley floor encompassing an estimated 800 hectares of land . 
The terminal continues to expand as new production platforms come on-line , and will eventually occupy most of the allotted land . 
[ORG Sangachal  ] currently is the primary collection and redistribution point for most of the oil and gas produced off-shore , which accounts for most of [MISC Azerbaijani  ] production . 
All of the major oil and gas pipelines originate in the [LOC Sangachal Terminal  ] or the immediate area , making it the single most important structure for the movement and production of oil and gas exports . 
( The [ORG GOAJ  ] and [ORG Azersun Holdings  ] have plans to develop a second oil terminal with an initial capacity of 10 million tons at [LOC Garadagh  ] , close to [LOC Baku  ] . 
The [ORG GOAJ  ] may also develop new commercial port facilities in the same area . 
) <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG BTC  ] pipeline begins at the [LOC Sangachal Terminal  ] and extends through central [LOC Azerbaijan  ] , across [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] , to the port of [LOC Ceyhan  ] . 
The [MISC Azerbaijani  ] portion of the [ORG BTC  ] is approximately 450 kilometers long and includes the [LOC Sangachal Terminal  ] and associated pump stations. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [MISC Western  ] or [LOC Supsa  ] pipeline is a [MISC Soviet  ] era line that is approximately 460 kilometers long in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] and continues on in [LOC Georgia  ] to the port of [LOC Supsa  ] . 
The line is parallel to the [ORG BTC  ] line for most of its route in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] . 
The [ORG SCP  ] gas pipeline generally parallels the [ORG BTC  ] to its terminus in [LOC Erzurum  ] , forming an energy corridor from [LOC Sangachal  ] to the [MISC Georgian  ] border. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [LOC Novorossiysk  ] or northern pipeline runs parallel to the [LOC Caspian  ] coastline up to the [MISC Russian  ] border and is approximately 240 kilometers long . 
This pipeline is estimated to move approximately two million tons of oil a year versus the 30-35 million being transported with the [LOC BTC.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Azerbaijan  ] moves a small percentage of its oil , currently as much as 140,000 tons a month at peak use , by rail . 
This amount is expected to increase significantly as the flow of [LOC Caspian  ] oil from [LOC Kazakhstan  ] and to a lesser extent [LOC Turkmenistan  ] increases as expected . 
The rail lines originate in the [LOC Sangachal  ] area at rail on-load terminals and are transported over existing mixed use rail lines to [LOC Georgia  ] . 
Responsibility for the security of rail transport is believed to lie mainly with the railroad authority . 
[ORG SSPS  ] ---- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG SSPS  ] is the prime protector of onshore energy infrastructure and has invested considerable resources to [LOC BAKU  ] 00000855 003.2 OF 004 ensure the protection of critical structures . 
[ORG SSPS  ] has a annual budget of approximately USD 10 million and over 800 personnel dedicated to pipeline security . 
Investment by [ORG SSPS  ] in training and equipment is expanding each year . 
Recent investments include the fielding of a [MISC Motorola TETRA  ] communications system on the [ORG BTC  ] and [LOC Novorossiysk  ] corridors as well as the purchase of two helicopters and an additional 20 patrol vehicles . 
[ORG SSPS  ] has nine regional branches to cover the two main pipeline routes ( [ORG BTC/Western/Erzurum  ] ) and [LOC Novorossiysk  ] . 
[ORG SSPS  ] is also opening a new 200 hectare training facility near [LOC Baku  ] which should give it greater capacity to conduct the training of pipeline protection personnel which average three months of training prior to deployment depending on ability and prior experience . 
The [ORG BTC  ] and [ORG SCP  ] pipelines themselves are equipped with state-of-the-art electronic monitoring devices which can detect minute changes in flow pressure associated with hot or cold taps or with losses of pipeline integrity. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG SSPS  ] works closely with the [ORG BTC  ] operators ( primarily [ORG BP  ] ) to ensure pipeline security . 
The routine patrol coverage of the [ORG BTC  ] segments located in [LOC Azerbaijan  ] has been favorably commented on by [ORG BP  ] and by [ORG SSPS  ] , who feel that the overlapping of [ORG SSPS  ] , [ORG BP  ] maintenance patrols and local line minders was working well . 
[ORG SSPS  ] is expanding its vehicle fleet for pipeline protection operations to 100 vehicles and will increase its horse-mounted patrol , used for the most rugged and remote parts of the pipeline , from 30 to 100 in the coming year . 
[ORG SSPS  ] is proud of its record of low or no theft of product in the [MISC Azerbaijani  ] segments , as compared to the line tapping problems in [LOC Georgia  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] , and lack of criminal and/or terrorist activity along the [MISC Azerbaijani  ] sections of the pipelines. <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) As noted above , the [LOC Sangachal Terminal  ] presents some serious concerns . 
[ORG BP  ] and [ORG SSPS  ] work cooperatively to manage access to the facility , with [ORG SSPS  ] manning a primary checkpoint on the spur off the main highway at the entry to the terminal area and [ORG BP  ] controlling movement within the structure . 
The terminal is guarded by an [ORG SSPS  ] detachment which patrols the perimeter on a 24 hour basis and has a 25 man armed react team on standby . 
The area is fenced and has CCTV coverage monitored by [ORG SSPS  ] and [ORG BP  ] . 
[ORG SSPS  ] also has an elevated observation point located on an adjacent mesa , capable of monitoring the entire valley in which the [LOC Sangachal  ] facility is located . 
According to [ORG SSPS  ] , the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] has anti-aircraft capability and is responsible for the air defense of the area . 
Both [ORG BP  ] and [ORG SSPS  ] report that a number of physical security improvements are planned or underway for the facility to improve the control of vehicles and personnel both on entry to the terminal and within. <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG SSPS  ] recently conducted joint contingency training exercises in each of its regional areas with pipeline security elements from the regional offices for the [ORG Ministry of National Security  ] ( [ORG MNS  ] ) and the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] ( [ORG MIA  ] ) , as well as [ORG BP  ] and the local regional administrations through which the pipeline passes . 
[ORG Offshore Facilities  ] ------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) Protection of offshore energy infrastructure facilities is the responsibility of the [MISC Azerbaijani  ] [ORG Navy  ] and [ORG Coast Guard  ] , although there is no clear delineation of responsibilities between the two . 
Many security and industry sources state that the [ORG Navy  ] and [ORG Coast Guard  ] take seriously their responsibilities to protect the production platforms and undersea pipelines , but lack resources . 
The navy maintains a patrol ship on alert on [LOC Jiloy Island  ] , but appears to lack the capability to place a vessel continuously on station near the primary production platforms and as such would be unable to prevent or respond quickly to an event on a platform . 
The [ORG Navy  ] currently has radar coverage in the platform areas that is planned to be enhanced by a feed from [LOC BAKU  ] 00000855 004.2 OF 004 the [ORG BP  ] collision avoidance radars . 
The [ORG USG  ] is currently assisting in the refurbishment of five [MISC Azerbaijani  ] [ORG Coast Guard  ] vessels and upgrades of radars and navigation/communications equipment on five [MISC Azerbaijani  ] [ORG Navy  ] vessels , which should be completed by next summer and which could increase the GOAJ’s response capacity , although delimitation and communication/coordination issues will remain. <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG USG  ] has trained and equipped an [MISC Azerbaijani  ] naval commando unit and continues to hone its skills with follow-on exchanges twice a year . 
This commando unit has the capability to respond to the platforms with rigid hulled inflatable boats ( [ORG RHIBS  ] ) provided by the [ORG USG  ] , but the lack of a mobile platform from which to launch them at or near the platforms severely limits their abilities to respond quickly to an emerging incident . 
[ORG BP  ] maintains a 500 meter restricted zone around the offshore platforms , but if a violator moves into this area the only planned response is to shut down the platform . 
Currently the only regular patrol near the platforms is the standby boat operated by [ORG BP.  ] <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The head of the [ORG SSPS  ] , General [PER Akhundov  ] , outlined what he saw as the problem by contrasting the situation in the [LOC Caspian  ] with what he saw on a trip last year to [LOC Norway  ] . 
In [LOC Norway  ] he saw a [MISC Norwegian  ] navy vessel on active patrol around a group of platforms 150 kilometers from shore , and wondered why [LOC Azerbaijan  ] could not do the same with the [LOC Chirag  ] , [LOC Central Azeri  ] , and [LOC East  ] and [LOC West Azeri  ] platforms . 
He also expressed concern about the pipelines as they neared the shore at [LOC Sangachal  ] . 
The waters are extremely shallow for the first several kilometers , perhaps as little as five meters . 
The shallow water coupled with a number of fishing vessels make effective patrol and protection by the coast guard and navy difficult as the lines are readily accessible . 
COMMENT ------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The vulnerabilities of [MISC Azerbaijan’s  ] critical energy infrastructure -- particularly at the [LOC Sangachal  ] energy terminal and the offshore platforms -- are made more acute by [MISC Azerbaijan’s  ] location next to [LOC Iran  ] and the small , but growing number of indigenous extremist groups with ties to transnational terrorists . 
Although the January arrest of the “Mahdi [MISC Army”  ] which had been working under [MISC Iranian  ] instructions to provide information on [MISC Azerbaijan’s  ] critical energy infrastructure highlighted some of these issues , we , like [ORG BP  ] , believe that the Government of [LOC Azerbaijan  ] does not fully recognize the vulnerabilities in its current energy infrastructure security arrangements . 
We also are concerned by the lack of clear delineation of responsibility for protection of offshore facilities . 
Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Araz Azimov  ] plans to present a briefing on [MISC Azerbaijan’s  ] energy infrastructure security needs at the July 9-10 bilateral security consultations . 
We view this briefing as an opportunity to begin a dialogue with the [ORG GOAJ  ] on this vitally important subject , and strongly urge the Department to explore options to help [LOC Azerbaijan  ] better assess these vulnerabilities , in line with the [ORG NATO Riga Summit  ] declaration on energy security .
