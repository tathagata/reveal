( C ) [ORG MFA  ] Permanent Secretary [PER Gretar Mar Sigurdsson  ] , the acting chief of the [ORG MFA  ] during Foreign Minister [PER Gisladottir  ] 's extended absence , informed the Ambassador October 17 that [PER Gisladottir  ] intends to play a leading role in the government 's efforts to secure international financing after she returns to [LOC Iceland  ] October 20 . 
The Minister plans to call the Secretary this week to request that the [LOC U.S.  ] consider contributing to the estimated ten billion dollars in foreign loans that [LOC Iceland  ] requires to get through the current financial crisis. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Sigurdsson  ] acknowledged that the four-week absence of the Foreign Minister ( who is also the head of the junior coalition partner ) has resulted in organizational and leadership problems among the various ministries and agencies involved in managing the financial crisis . 
[PER Sigurdsson  ] 's own serious illness has further hampered [ORG MFA  ] efforts to stay on top of rapidly changing developments . 
[PER Gisladottir  ] , however , has the political and popular clout to help the Prime Minister define and steer the country towards the best possible outcome for its citizens . 
[PER Sigurdsson  ] added that she is determined that the present government coalition of her [ORG Social Democratic Alliance  ] and the Prime Minister 's [ORG Independence Party  ] will survive the present difficulties. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Sigurdsson  ] said the government is uncomfortable with the prospect of a large loan from [LOC Russia  ] and wants to avoid the dependency that such a financial obligation would necessarily entail . 
[LOC Iceland  ] would prefer to reduce its obligation to [LOC Russia  ] by relying on a basket of loans from a mix of lending countries . 
So far , the [MISC Japanese  ] have indicated a willingness to be generous , and the [MISC Chinese  ] have also suggested they might contribute . 
The [ORG MFA  ] would like the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Germany  ] to make significant contributions . 
The [ORG MFA  ] 's plan is for [MISC Gi#zn*Q|Qspite  ] the outpouring of horrifyingly bad news for [MISC Icelandic  ] citizens , the government has demonstrated a puzzling lack of urgency , combined with a reluctance to reach out to those non-Nordics who might possibly be in a position to help . 
Without pressure from this Embassy , for instance , the Finance Minister would not even have asked to meet with [ORG Treasury  ] officials during his recent visit to [LOC Washington  ] . 
Part of this may be the sheer difficulty in collecting information from the financial institutions here and overseas ; part of it may be the hesitancy to show foreigners how bad the financial situation is ; part may be inter-governmental and political squabbles within the coalition partners , and between departments and [PER David Oddson  ] 's [ORG Central Bank  ] . 
The virtual decapitation of the [ORG MFA  ] during this period is certainly one reason for the appearance of hapless stumbling , and [PER Gisladottir  ] 's absence from [ORG Alliance Party  ] and coalition counsels was definitely felt . 
The news that she is prepared to exert her usual authority and add a decisive and capable executive to the government 's small and over-stretched body of decision-makers is good news for her country and for our relationship. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Embassy Comment continued: [PER Gisladottir  ] returned on October 18 and attended a well-publicized party meeting the following day . 
Sources close to her say , though , that the operation in [LOC New York  ] to remove a brain tumor was more serious than the public is aware , and that she faces a long and difficult convalescence . 
She announced yesterday that she will undergo a follow-up operation in the near future in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
We have heard privately that she may then require chemotherapy . 
Although this astute , powerful , and decisive leader obviously wants to be engaged as the government maps its way out of this crisis , it is unclear how active a role her health will permit her to play .
