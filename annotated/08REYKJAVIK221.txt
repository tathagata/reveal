[PER Sigurdsson  ] said the [ORG Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland  ] ( [ORG FME  ] ) and [ORG Landsbanki  ] bank had been meeting all night and the [ORG FME  ] has taken control of [ORG Landsbanki  ] under the emergency powers granted by [ORG Althingi  ] ( Parliament ) .

[PER Sigurdsson  ] described it as a necessary step to ensure the continued orderly operation of domestic banking . 
After speaking in [MISC Icelandic  ] with local press , [PER Haarde  ] took questions in [MISC English  ] from the mostly [MISC British  ] reporters who were concerned with what these developments mean for the depositors of [ORG Icebank  ] , a subsidiary of [ORG Landsbanki  ] with large operations in the [LOC UK  ] . 
[PER Haarde  ] said that he could not really answer , but he thought the assets of the bank would cover these deposits and depositors need not worry. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) At the end of the conference , a reporter asked about the pending currency loan from [LOC Russia  ] and [PER Haarde  ] responded that [LOC Iceland  ] had requested loans and other help from its friends ; [MISC Nordic  ] countries had responded positively , but others had not . 
He added that in a situation like that , [LOC Iceland  ] must look for new friends . 
[PER Ossur Skarphedinsson  ] , Minister of Industry and currently the Acting Foreign Minister , was more blunt in a morning radio interview . 
He said [LOC Iceland  ] had looked to its friends for assistance on the financial crisis and some turned out to be not so much of a friend , like the [LOC U.S.  ] He said it hurt , and added that after about 50 years of a special relationship with the [LOC U.S.  ] , the only thing [LOC Iceland  ] got now was the middle finger . 
Adding to the [LOC US  ] bashing was [PER Gudni Agustsson  ] , Chairman of the [ORG Progressive  ] party ( in opposition ) , who wanted the [ORG Althingi  ] and the government to send [PER Putin  ] a thank you note for his support to the [MISC Icelandic  ] nation .

The [ORG Icelandic Central Bank  ] reported that a team will go to [LOC Moscow  ] to work out the details . 
The [MISC British  ] publication [ORG Spectator  ] immediately reported on its website that the price for the loan was the ability of [LOC Russia  ] 's military to use the former [LOC U.S.  ] military base in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
Asked at the press conference whether the [MISC Russians  ] would get access to any base facilities in return for a loan , the Prime Minister said no .
