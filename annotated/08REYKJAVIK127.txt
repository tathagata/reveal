[PER Carol van Voorst  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: Twenty-one months after the closure of [ORG U.S. Naval Air Station Keflavik  ] , one major issue remains unresolved: the ultimate disposition of the residual parts and equipment associated with the [LOC Iceland  ] [MISC Air Defense System  ] ( [MISC IADS  ] ) . 
The Government of [LOC Iceland  ] has made the [MISC IADS  ] radar system its key contribution to the defense of their country and [ORG NATO  ] , and desperately wants to complete this transfer as soon as possible . 
Although the [ORG U.S. Air Force  ] has put together a significant effort to develop a Foreign Military Sales ( [MISC FMS  ] ) case to allow the transfer , [LOC Iceland  ] is still waiting to receive an authoritative Letter of Offer and Acceptance ( [ORG LOA  ] ) . 
Post greatly appreciates all efforts but is concerned that any further delay in providing an [ORG LOA  ] will materially undermine our bilateral defense relationship . 
We look forward to the promulgation of a final [ORG LOA  ] no later than July 31 . 
End Summary . 
Background ---------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The NATO-owned [LOC Iceland  ] [MISC Air Defense System  ] ( [MISC IADS  ] ) is composed of four radar sites at [LOC Iceland  ] 's geographic " corners " linked to a control and reporting center and integrated software support facility at the former [ORG U.S. Naval Air Station Keflavik  ] ( [ORG NASKEF  ] ) site . 
The final disposition of [MISC U.S.-owned  ] [ORG IADS  ] equipment ( primarily " supply point items " or spare parts ) was left unresolved during the 2006 [ORG NASKEF  ] closure negotiations , though a date of August 16 , 2007 was set for the handover of the system to the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] . 
These items , a large number of which are unique to the [MISC IADS  ] system and cannot be used elsewhere , are essential to the continued operation of the radars. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Discussions regarding the sale or lease of this equipment through a Foreign Military Sales ( [MISC FMS  ] ) case took place throughout 2007 ( Refs A and C ) . 
At both working levels and at the Under Secretary level , the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] made it clear that [MISC IADS  ] transfer is of key importance and that an operational and reliable system is [LOC Iceland  ] 's single largest contribution to its own defense and its biggest contribution to [MISC NATO.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In an 8 May 2007 memorandum , Under Secretary of Defense for Policy [PER Edelman  ] requested that [ORG USAF  ] inventory [MISC U.S.-owned  ] equipment vital to continued [MISC IADS  ] operation , and develop options for its transfer to [LOC Iceland  ] " minimiz [ ing ] the cost of such transfers to both [LOC Iceland  ] and the [ORG Air Force  ] " ( Ref B ) . 
Despite serious efforts by [ORG OSD  ] , [ORG USAF International Affairs  ] , [ORG USAF Europe  ] , [ORG EUCOM  ] , and others , [ORG USAF  ] was not able to present an [MISC FMS  ] case to [LOC Iceland  ] for consideration until October 2007 . 
The price requested was approximately $5.8 million . 
Meanwhile , a contractual arrangement has allowed [LOC Iceland  ] necessary access to these items despite the fact that the August 2007 [MISC IADS  ] transfer date has passed . 
Repricing --------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Iceland  ] 's Ministry for Foreign Affairs ( [ORG MFA  ] ) raised concerns in November 2007 that not all items in the case were actually [MISC U.S.-owned  ] and that the price for some items appeared to be excessive given their age and condition . 
These concerns generated a reevaluation of the ownership of all the items as well as a review of whether the price for this materiel was statutorily allowable . 
Initial indications to the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] were that some items were in fact NATO-owned and that the price of the [MISC FMS  ] case would most likely decrease as a result . 
Nevertheless , upon completion of the review , [ORG DOD  ] informed the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Washington  ] in February 2008 that the price of the [MISC FMS  ] case had increased by approximately $2 million to $7.9 million , pending final preparation of a new [ORG LOA  ] . 
( Note: The entire 2008 defense budget for [LOC Iceland  ] is approximately $20 million . 
End note . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Though our [MISC Icelandic  ] counterparts have been gravely disappointed at the lack of progress in this matter , they have been patient , noting that they would likely agree to purchase at least some portion of the items in the [MISC FMS  ] case . 
However , through the spring and summer , the [ORG Icelandic Government  ] has become increasingly anxious , and representatives have raised the issue at almost every opportunity ( ref E ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) On 9 June , the [MISC Icelandic  ] [ORG Embassy  ] in [LOC Washington  ] was informed that the revised [ORG LOA  ] would be delayed again due to concerns over proper pricing . 
Post understands there is some possibility that this new review may actually result in a price reduction . 
[ORG MFA  ] reps have informed us that an [ORG LOA  ] , whatever the terms , is long overdue . 
The lack of a formal offer undermines their ability to appraise the offer and make necessary decisions . 
Additionally , the [ORG MFA  ] has asked whether they should regard the delays and revisions as a demonstration of the level of the [ORG USG  ] 's commitment to the broader defense relationship . 
Comment: The Need for Conclusion --------------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) From the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister down , every level of the [ORG Icelandic Government  ] has made it clear that [MISC IADS  ] is the linchpin of [LOC Iceland  ] 's security policy . 
[LOC Iceland  ] sees [MISC IADS  ] as its major contribution to facilitate the security operations of greatest visible importance ; i.e. , [ORG NATO  ] air policing . 
Although positive about the [MISC U.S.-Iceland  ] defense and security relationship overall , the [ORG MFA  ] and new [LOC Iceland  ] Defense Agency nonetheless are frustrated with the dragged-out [ORG IADS  ] FMS process. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The longer this process takes , the more we add credence to the perception that we do not take this [ORG NATO  ] Ally 's concerns seriously . 
The considerable efforts of all of us at [ORG EUCOM  ] , [ORG OSD  ] , [ORG USAF  ] , State , here in [LOC Reykjavik  ] , and elsewhere to build a new defense relationship after the closure of [ORG NASKEF  ] are at risk . 
An impression of shabby treatment is taking hold -- an impression that we cannot allow to remain if we wish [LOC Iceland  ] to contribute to [ORG NATO  ] in the [MISC North Atlantic  ] neighborhood , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and elsewhere. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) I look forward to the promulgation of the revised [ORG LOA  ] and am hopeful that this matter can be wrapped up by no later than 31 July 2008 . 
[ORG Embassy Reykjavik  ] stands ready to assist in any way possible .
