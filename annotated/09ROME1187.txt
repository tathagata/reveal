( C/NF ) SUMMARY . 
Though PM Berlusconi’s parliamentary majority is strong , and nobody is yet willing to predict his political demise , a growing list of scandals , adverse court decisions and health issues have weakened him and led some erstwhile [PER Berlusconi  ] allies to begin hedging their bets on his political longevity . 
In a souring political environment , talk of conspiracy theories often trumps real political debate and distracts the [PER Berlusconi  ] government from pursuing , or even developing , a coherent political agenda . 
END SUMMARY . 
PRIVATE MATTERS WEIGHING ON [PER BERLUSCONI  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) After a long hot spring and summer of personal and professional scandals , PM [PER Berlusconi  ] , returning from the August recess appeared briefly rejuvenated by a successful [MISC G8  ] summit and continued popularity with his base . 
However , the first of several blows fell on October 7 when a civil court ruled that the [PER Berlusconi  ] family’s flagship business , [MISC Finnivest  ] , must pay a rival company [MISC Euro 750  ] million for damages occurred as a result of a [MISC Finnivest  ] lawyer bribing a judge in a decision involving both companies . 
Two days later , the [ORG Italian Constitutional Court  ] concluded that one of the [PER Berlusconi  ] government’s first pieces of legislation , a 2008 law postponing criminal investigations against [PER Berlusconi  ] and other senior officials , was unconstitutional ( [ORG REFTEL  ] ) . 
As a result , [MISC Italian  ] magistrates have , once again , taken up several long-standing criminal cases against [PER Berlusconi  ] , with one case due to resume as early as November. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C/NF ) Two officials [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] in separate conversations with the [MISC Embassy  ] , recently described the Prime Minister in strikingly similar terms . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told the Ambassador October 23 that [PER Berlusconi  ] is “physically and politically weak , ” describing the normally hyperactive [PER Berlusconi  ] as “not energetic.” [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told an [MISC Embassy  ] political officer October 22 that , “we are all worried about his health , ” noting that [PER Berlusconi  ] has fainted three times in public in recent years and that his medical tests have come back “a complete mess.” [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said Berlusconi’s frequent late nights and penchant for partying hard mean he does not get sufficient rest . 
The [MISC Italian  ] press reported October 27 that [PER Berlusconi  ] has a mild case of scarlet fever , which he reportedly contracted from his grandchild . 
( Note: [PER Berlusconi  ] dozed off briefly during the [MISC Ambassador’s  ] initial courtesy call in September , and looked distracted and tired at an October 19 event attended by the Ambassador . 
End note . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C/NF ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] termed [PER Berlusconi  ] overwhelmed with private concerns . 
He noted that [PER Berlusconi  ] has felt alienated from his family since his wife , [PER Veronica Lario  ] , set off a public uproar by publishing an open letter last spring asking for a divorce and accusing the 74-year old PM of consorting with minors . 
[PER Lario  ] is reportedly asking for fifty percent of Berlusconi’s personal assets plus [MISC Euro  ] 100 million in yearly support . 
At the same time , according to [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] , [PER Berlusconi  ] is afraid he will need to liquidate important business assets to make the [MISC Euro 750  ] million payment ordered by a civil court . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] added that a [MISC Palermo-based  ] mafia investigation involving [MISC XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] [PER Berlusconi  ] ally and confidant already convicted of ties to organized crime could turn into a damaging public spectacle . 
LEADING TO CONSPIRACY THEORIES <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NF ) A number of [MISC Embassy  ] contacts have described a political environment dominated by conspiracy theories . 
In the wake of the two court rulings , [PER Berlusconi  ] accused President of the [MISC Republic  ] [PER Napolitano  ] of working against him and lashed out emotionally against the judicial system , in general . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told the Ambassador that Berlusconi’s outburst had led to “frosty” relations with [ORG Napolitano  ] and said the episode has made him appear weak . 
Several PdL officials have hinted darkly to us that “institutional forces” are trying to unseat [PER Berlusconi  ] . 
( Note: In [MISC Italian  ] political parlance , “institutional forces” can serve to mean one of many groups operating and wielding influence behind the scenes: business groups , intelligence services , freemasons , the [LOC Vatican  ] , the magistracy , the [LOC United States  ] , etc . 
While [MISC Italians  ] are notably conspiracy-minded , their paranoia -- at least as far as [MISC Italian  ] domestic politics go -- has historically been well-founded . 
End note . 
) [LOC ROME  ] 00001187 002.2 OF 003 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C/NF ) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] confided that [PER Berlusconi  ] believes the [MISC Italian  ] intelligence services might have deliberately entrapped him in his alleged affair involving a minor . 
During XXXXXXXXXXXX’s conversation with the [MISC Embassy  ] political officer , [PER Berlusconi  ] called [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] to confide that an arrest was imminent of four [MISC Italian  ] Carabinieri believed to be blackmailing the [LOC Lazio  ] regional governor with a sex-tape . 
( Note: The story of the [LOC Lazio  ] governor and a transsexual prostitute exploded in the press a few days later . 
End note . 
) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told the [MISC Embassy  ] officer that this case has convinced [PER Berlusconi  ] that he cannot trust his own intelligence services . 
Separately , on October 21 , [MISC Northern League  ] leader [PER Umberto Bossi  ] , commenting on [MISC Berlusconi’s  ] troubles , told the Ambassador that organized crime figures had probably set the trap for [PER Berlusconi  ] on some of the sex scandals , but that nobody denies that [PER Berlusconi  ] willingly went for the bait. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C/NF ) In a replay of the foreign press-induced scandals of last spring and summer , a [ORG London Times  ] article accusing [MISC Italian  ] troops in [LOC Afghanistan  ] of paying off [MISC Taliban  ] insurgents sparked speculation in and out of the [MISC GoI  ] that the [ORG USG  ] might have leaked the information to discredit the [PER Berlusconi  ] government . 
Moreover , it is not uncommon these days for PdL politicians to speculate-- via the press or even directly to [MISC Embassy  ] officers-- that the new [LOC U.S.  ] administration would like to see the [PER Berlusconi  ] government fall ; some even believe the [ORG USG  ] is actively undermining [PER Berlusconi  ] . 
The Ambassador recently probed [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] and Foreign Minister [PER Franco Frattini  ] to determine whether they shared this belief ; both averred that they thought [MISC Berlusconi’s  ] relationship with the [LOC US  ] administration was strong . 
AND PALACE INTRIGUE <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C/NF ) One of [MISC Berlusconi’s  ] would-be heirs , [ORG Chamber of Deputies  ] President [PER Gianfranco Fini  ] , picked one of his periodic fights with [PER Berlusconi  ] in September , ostensibly over euthanasia and living wills , but the real issues were [MISC Berlusconi’s  ] non-democratic leadership style inside the party and the growing weight of the [MISC Northern League  ] ( [ORG LN  ] ) . 
More recently , the powerful Minister of [LOC Economy  ] , [PER Giulio Tremonti  ] , has openly challenged [PER Berlusconi  ] on fiscal policy , leading to talk simultaneously of his possible resignation as well as the possibility he was seeking to eventually succeed [PER Berlusconi  ] . 
In response to a direct question from the Ambassador , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said there was a small , but unlikely , possibility the government could fall . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] told us [PER Tremonti  ] , [PER Fini  ] and former Minister of Interior [PER Giuseppe Pisanu  ] are laying the groundwork for a post-Berlusconi succession struggle but felt the government remained stable for the time being . 
AS WELL AS ERRATIC DECISIONS <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C/NF ) Media mogul [PER Berlusconi  ] might be gaffe-prone when speaking off the cuff , but he has historically shown himself astute at strategic messaging . 
Those skills were noticeably absent in a recent incident which provoked both criticism and head-scratching from [PER Berlusconi  ] friend and foe alike . 
Ahead of a three-day trip to [LOC Russia  ] to celebrate [PER Vladimir Putin’s  ] birthday in mid-October , [PER Berlusconi  ] put out a press line that the visit was a “strictly private affair.” This announcement was met with disbelief and some mockery . 
Adding to the mystery , however , the day before his departure , [PER Berlusconi  ] canceled his participation in the state visit of [ORG Jordan’s King Abdullah of Jordan  ] , staying in [LOC Milan  ] with the explanation that he was feeling under the weather . 
[PER Berlusconi  ] , who prides himself on his personal relationships with key [LOC Middle East  ] interlocutors thus , unavoidably , left the impression that , in choosing private fun over statecraft , he was husbanding his flagging energies for a blow-out party at [PER Putin’s  ] private dacha . 
With the further news that [PER Berlusconi  ] was accompanied on the trip solely by [PER Valentino Valentini  ] , an unofficial intermediary/bagman who serves as [MISC Berlusconi’s  ] interpreter , Italy’s political class openly questioned whether [PER Berlusconi  ] was going to [LOC Russia  ] principally because the scrutiny of his private time by [MISC Italian  ] and foreign photographers had made parties in [LOC Italy  ] too risky for the time being . 
COMMENT <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C/NF ) Sex scandals , criminal investigations , family problems and financial concerns appear to be weighing heavily on [MISC Berlusconi’s  ] personal and political health , as well as on [LOC ROME  ] 00001187 003.2 OF 003 his decision-making ability . 
It is too early to begin speculating about [MISC Berlusconi’s  ] political demise , and [PER Berlusconi  ] has a well-known knack for rebounding . 
However , though most are trying hard not to be too obvious about it , some of [MISC Berlusconi’s  ] own lieutenants have apparently decided it is not too early to begin laying the groundwork for “il dopo , ” as [MISC Italians  ] call the potential post-Berlusconi era . 
In this souring political environment , conspiracy theories have all but supplanted serious political debate . 
Septel will address the implications of [MISC Berlusconi’s  ] fortunes on how we do business with the government .
