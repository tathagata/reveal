( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Summary:  ] The October 12-17 port visit of the [MISC USS Wasp  ] provided a visible demonstration of USG intent to honor its defense commitment to [LOC Iceland  ] following the September closure of [ORG Naval Air Station Keflavik  ] ( [ORG NASKEF  ] ) . 
The Prime Minister , Foreign Minister , and Justice Minister - just back from the [LOC Washington  ] signing of a new [MISC Joint Understanding  ] on future security arrangements - praised the timeliness and substance of the visit , and host government engagement was enthusiastic and professional. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Local media coverage highlighted the [PER Wasp  ] 's humanitarian relief capabilities and provided striking coverage of joint training by the [PER Wasp  ] 's helicopter detachment and [ORG Icelandic Police  ] and [ORG Coast Guard  ] . 
The press also ran human interest stories on the lives of sailors and on [PER Wasp  ] 's community outreach projects . 
The public welcomed sailors warmly , and there were no reports of liberty incidents . 
The visit undercut local skepticism over [LOC U.S.  ] intent and capability to uphold its defense commitment , while strengthening [MISC Icelandic  ] security forces and interagency planning - as well each side 's familiarity with the other 's procedures - in preparation for future exercises and contingencies . 
End summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The [MISC USS Wasp  ] ( LHD-1 ) , with an embarked crew of roughly 1300 sailors , visited [ORG Reykjavik  ] October 12-17 , arriving twelve days after the closure of [ORG Naval Air Station Keflavik  ] ( [ORG NASKEF  ] ) and one day after Secretary Rice joined [MISC Icelandic  ] Prime Minister [PER Haarde  ] and Foreign SIPDIS Minister [PER Sverrisdottir  ] in signing a " [MISC Joint Understanding  ] " on modernizing [MISC U.S.-Iceland  ] defense and security relations. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) With support from [ORG USDAO Oslo  ] and [ORG NAVEUR  ] and an enthusiastic host government , Embassy and [MISC USS Wasp  ] - the first [LOC U.S.  ] warship to visit [LOC Iceland  ] since 2002 - arranged for heavy media and political outreach in connection with the event , including: -- a media embark by [MISC MH-53  ] helicopter to cover the vessel 's arrival , which became a lead story in all major media ( " The [MISC Yankees Are Back !  ] 
" ) ; -- ship tours and a reception for [ORG GOI  ] officials and targeted groups ( with a focus on students and rising political leaders ) emphasizing the [ORG LHD  ] 's secondary role in humanitarian relief operations ; -- community relations projects ( visits to the children 's wing of the national hospital and a home for the elderly by sailors and the 6th [ORG Fleet Jazz Ensemble  ] , respectively , and sports matches with local notables ) ; and -- a joint [ORG Icelandic National Police  ] " [MISC Viking Squad  ] " /Icelandic [ORG Coast Guard  ] ( ICG ) counterterrorism training event supported by the [ORG Wasp  ] 's helicopter detachment . 
The most memorable TV image was of [ORG Icelandic Police  ] special forces and [ORG Coast Guard  ] EOD specialists coming off an [MISC MH-53  ] to assault a suspected terrorist hideout . 
( Several Icelanders have commented to embassy officers that they never knew their police had this capability . 
) <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Media coverage was quite positive overall , with print media offering extensive photo spreads and broadcast media enjoying the opportunity for compelling video . 
The media offered no editorial reservations to counter the [LOC U.S.  ] message that the visit demonstrated the sincerity and robustness of [MISC American  ] commitment to [LOC Iceland  ] 's defense . 
( Post is sending media summaries and video files to [ORG Wasp  ] and [ORG NAVEUR  ] via email . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) PM [PER Geir Haarde  ] , Foreign Minister [PER Valgerdur Sverrisdottir  ] , and Justice Minister [PER Bjorn Bjarnason  ] all toured the [ORG Wasp  ] and expressed enthusiasm for the visit and for the briefings they received on the [ORG Wasp  ] 's amphibious assault and humanitarian assistance capabilities . 
In public comments , the PM and FM made an explicit link between the [MISC Joint Understanding  ] and the ship visit , noting that the multi-role [ORG Wasp  ] and her crew exemplified the mobile , flexible over-the-horizon forces that the [LOC U.S.  ] had said could defend [LOC Iceland  ] in a crisis. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Officials from the [ORG Defense Department  ] of the [ORG Ministry for Foreign Affairs  ] , the ICG , and other agencies noted their appreciation to embassy officers , with one [ORG GOI  ] official commenting that the visit made it easier for him to be " taken seriously " when he argued the benefits of [MISC U.S.-Iceland  ] security cooperation . 
[ORG REYKJAVIK  ] 00000401 002.4 OF 002 <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Opposition parties largely ignored the visit . 
The youth wing of the [MISC Left-Green  ] party , which has a stated policy of pacifism , declined a tour invitation and instead issued a public statement decrying the visit . 
They were echoed by the [ORG Alliance of Military Base Opponents  ] , which castigated the [ORG Wasp  ] 's counterterrorism training with the [ORG Icelandic Police  ] and ICG as contributing to the " militarization " of the security forces . 
The only public demonstration came in the form of four protestors who stood gamely in the rain pierside for an hour on 15 October , leaving as soon as their TV interviews were done. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) The public welcomed sailors warmly and there were no reports of liberty incidents . 
The only sour note: even with tour , store , and restaurant discounts arranged by the Embassy and local authorities , [LOC Iceland  ] is an expensive liberty port . 
At Ambassador 's direction , post is already engaging with [MISC Icelandic  ] authorities to explore means of making the next ship visit easier on sailors' wallets. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Comment: In the wake of the [ORG NASKEF  ] closure decision , the leading opposition party and some press commentators ( including some who had supported the presence of [ORG NASKEF  ] ) spoke of abrogating the 1951 [MISC U.S.-Iceland Defense Agreement  ] , questioning [MISC American  ] intent and capability to come to the defense of [LOC Iceland  ] in a crisis . 
The [ORG Wasp  ] 's visit undercut those skeptics and confounded anti-NATO elements who had seen the [ORG NASKEF  ] closure as a step on the road to [MISC Icelandic  ] withdrawal from the [ORG Alliance.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The visit also strengthened the [ORG Navy  ] 's familiarity with [MISC Icelandic  ] security forces in preparation for future exercises and contingencies . 
The Police and [ORG Coast Guard  ] took good advantage of both the real-world force protection requirements of the visit and the counterterrorism training to develop and demonstrate their own capabilities . 
The visit also provided useful experience for the [ORG Defense Department  ] ( note: a division of the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] , [LOC Iceland  ] having no [ORG Defense Ministry  ] ) , [ORG Coast Guard  ] , Police , and [ORG Ministry of Justice  ] in staff work and coordination ( with one another and with the Embassy and [ORG Wasp  ] ) . 
End comment. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG U  ] ) Post offers sincere thanks to [ORG USEUCOM  ] , [ORG COMNAVEUR  ] , Sixth Fleet , and " [MISC Team Wasp  ] " for their outstanding support of [ORG USG  ] goals vis-a-vis this [ORG NATO  ] ally . 
We would warmly welcome another ship visit in 2007 . 
[ORG Wasp  ] has not cleared this message .
