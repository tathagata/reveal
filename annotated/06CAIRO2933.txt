( C ) We look forward to welcoming you to [LOC Sharm El Sheikh  ] . 
You come at a tense time for [LOC Egypt  ] . 
The [PER Mubarak  ] regime has come under criticism for its heavy-handed response to protest demonstrations in each of the past two weeks . 
Also , judicial decisions are expected on May 18 in both [PER Ayman Nour  ] 's appeal and the [ORG Supreme Judicial Council  ] 's disciplinary case against two senior judges who spoke out against election corruption . 
Some modest political reforms are possible before parliament breaks this summer . 
Preparations continue for more sweeping constitutional reforms in 2007 . 
But without vigorous leadership , the [ORG GOE  ] and parliament will backslide and institute half-measures at best . 
[PER Mubarak  ] remains deeply engaged in regional issues and continues to play an indispensable role on [LOC Israel/Palestine  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] , while helping also on [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Syria  ] , and [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
He clearly hopes that his elder statesman value , combined with the implicit threat of the [ORG Muslim Brotherhood  ] 's rise , will temper foreign pressure for more and faster democratic reforms . 
The succession overshadows all other political issues . 
The Prime Minister and his economic cabinet are soldiering ahead with privatization and liberalization of the economy , but face stubborn resistance from nationalist-statist quarters in and out of government , especially on [LOC Egypt  ] 's third rail ) public subsidies. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) On the bilateral track , your confirmed senior [ORG GOE  ] interlocutor will be Prime Minister [PER Nazif  ] , and we have a request in to see [PER Mubarak  ] . 
EGIS Chief [PER Omar Soliman  ] also told us he would be glad to see you , if schedules permit - he will be working the [MISC Israeli  ] and [ORG PA  ] delegations in [LOC Sharm  ] . 
You may wish to re-state our concern over the momentum on reform with [PER Nazif  ] or any of the others . 
[PER Nazif  ] will push back hard and may complain about USG/Congressional political conditioning of economic and miliary aid and the [ORG FTA  ] . 
Your appearance with [ORG Arab League  ] SYG [PER Moussa  ] will be an excellent venue to counter perceptions that the [LOC U.S.  ] commitment to foster democracy is flagging . 
[PER Moussa  ] may try to steer the discussion towards [LOC Iraq  ] and [MISC Israel-Palestine  ] . 
You may be able to blunt this by praising his own creditable efforts to foster democracy in the region through the [ORG Arab League  ] . 
End summary. ------------------------------------- 2006: Stepping Backward ( and Forward ) ------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) This spring has seen ample evidence that the regime 's domestic house is not in order . 
Whatever this says about backsliding or latent repression , the real story here is a vacuum of leadership on domestic policy . 
The aging [PER Mubarak  ] simply does not have a domestic counterpart to the formidable [PER Omar Soliman  ] , his consigliere on foreign policy matters . 
In earlier days , [PER Mubarak  ] would have bargained his way out of these messes . 
But PM [PER Nazif  ] lacks the common touch and [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] has not stepped up to the role . 
This leaves the field open to the heavy handed tactics of the old guard . 
The litany of mis-steps follows: -- Judicial disciplinary action against two senior judges who charged fraud in the parliamentary polls ; -- Suppression of activists and demonstrators supporting the judges , particularly on , but not limited to , May 11 ; -- State-influenced media attacks on reform advocates ; -- Extension of the [ORG Emergency Law  ] for two more years ; -- Postponement by two years of local council elections ; -- Continuing arrests and harassment of opposition activists ; and -- The conviction of opposition leader [PER Ayman Nour.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) At the same time , [PER Gamal Mubarak  ] , PM [PER Nazif  ] and other reformers insist the [ORG GOE  ] is on track for substantive political reform . 
They tell us that before the current parliamentary session ends ( in late June ) new legislation will be passed granting new press freedoms and greater judicial autonomy ) an issue at the heart of the judges' dispute . 
It is not clear that either measure will satisfy the press syndicate or the Judges Club , but they represent improvements and will be trumpeted by the [ORG GOE  ] as significant political reforms. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) More significantly , the [ORG GOE  ] is working on a package of up to 20 constitutional amendments , to be ratified by mid-2007 , and then submitted to referendum . 
This package is intended to drastically change [LOC Egypt  ] 's political landscape and will reportedly distribute of powers from the executive to the legislature and empowerment of provincial and local councils . 
It will also include measures that clear the way for the [ORG GOE  ] to lift the emergency law and enact new anti-terror legislation based on western models . 
For us the devil will be in the details ; without strong Presidential engagement , there will be a tremendous temptation to pass half-measures that preserve the ruling [ORG NDP  ] 's political monopoly. ----------------------------- Succession: The [ORG Lurking Issue  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Mubarak  ] 's current ( and presumably final ) six year term will end in 2011 , but many observers expect the transition sooner . 
The public fears that [PER Mubarak  ] 's domestic machinations are calculated to establish [PER Gamal  ] as his successor . 
[PER Gamal  ] remains coy and now avoids the limelight . 
No real contenders stand in his way ) [PER Amre Moussa  ] is the only often-named alternative -- and the existing legal framework clearly favors his candidacy . 
It is not yet clear that the [MISC Egyptian  ] military establishment ) [PER Mubarak  ] pere 's traditional base ) will tolerate the pharaonic succession of decidedly un-military [PER Gamal  ] . 
And the idea of [PER Gamal  ] 's succession remains unpopular with the press and public , on principle. ------------------------------------------ Economic Reform: Pushing Up a [PER Steeper Hill  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Nazif  ] 's economic team has made significant progress on economic reform , but now the hard work begins . 
The banking sector remains burdened with bad loans to state-owned companies that will be costly to eliminate . 
Subsidies , particularly for energy , are a heavy burden on the government budget ; [LOC Egypt  ] 's budget deficit grows even as its economy grows , undermining the confidence of potential foreign investors . 
The government does not yet seem prepared to reduce subsidies significantly or accept the job losses inevitable from the sale or closure of the most decrepit state-owned companies . 
With their momentum stalled by political realities , [PER Nazif  ] and his team are inclined to blame the [LOC United States  ] for refusing to open [ORG FTA  ] talks , which they hoped would drive the next stage of reform. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Mubarak  ] has apparently instructed his ministers not to raise the issue of military and economic assistance with [ORG USG  ] counterparts . 
He resents any political linkage or conditioning of assistance towards reform . 
But several members of [ORG Congress  ] have expressed reservations on the size and impact of the [MISC Egyptian  ] programs , especially on the military side . 
The [ORG GOE  ] dismisses these as irresponsible voices who wish to weaken [LOC Egypt  ] to bolster [LOC Israel  ] and insists that the Administration demonstrate its loyalty to [LOC Egypt  ] by standing firm . 
But our message has been that we need something positive to take to [ORG Congress.  ] ------ [ORG Darfur  ] ------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Mubarak  ] has issued a positive statement on the agreement on [ORG Darfur  ] and hinted at [LOC Egypt  ] , s support for its full implementation and for a transition to [ORG UN  ] forces in [ORG Darfur  ] . 
MFA diplomats tell us that [LOC Egypt  ] does not currently plan to increase its current level of 34 military advisors , but it may be more forthcoming should we ask for peacekeepers in real numbers , after the [ORG UN  ] assessment process . 
[PER Mubarak  ] also has genuine influence over [ORG Bashir  ] and [PER Qaddafi  ] and , if you see him , you may wish to urge him to press these contacts on cooperation. ---------------- [MISC Israel-Palestine  ] ---------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) The [MISC Egyptians  ] want to see [ORG Hamas  ] fail , but in the meantime , want to avoid heightened extremism in [LOC Gaza  ] and the [LOC West Bank  ] . 
They would like to see [PER Fatah  ] 's [MISC Palestinian  ] civil servants paid and are contributing directly to efforts to provide humanitarian assistance ) offering to serve as the conduit for all manner of assistance . 
In this regard , our intelligence collaboration with [PER Omar Soliman  ] , who is expected in [LOC Washington  ] next week , is now probably the most successful element of the relationship. -------------------------- WEF Appearance with [PER Moussa  ] -------------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Your appearance at the WEF with [ORG Arab League  ] SYG [PER Amre Moussa  ] will provide an excellent venue to challenge the view that the [ORG USG  ] is easing the pressure on [LOC Egypt  ] for democratic reform . 
[PER Moussa  ] will default to his longstanding theme that democratic progress depends on a just settlement of the [MISC Israel-Palestinian  ] conflict . 
He may also raise perceived [LOC U.S.  ] failures in [LOC Iraq  ] and double standards about WMD in [LOC Iran  ] and [LOC Israel  ] . 
You may wish to refer to the [ORG Arab League  ] 's 2004 [ORG Tunis Declaration  ] - particularly clause 2.3 of the declaration , in which member states pledged to " consolidate democratic practices , " " enlarge political participation , " and " foster all components of civil society . 
" You could flatter [PER Moussa  ] for his own creditable efforts on democracy and press him on how they should be implemented , seeking details on [ORG Arab League  ] efforts to implement these commitments .
