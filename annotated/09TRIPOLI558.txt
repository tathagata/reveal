Both [LOC Paris  ] and [LOC Washington  ] are committed to helping the [MISC Somali  ] [ORG Transitional Federal Government  ] 's ( [ORG TFG  ] ) security forces with some combination of cash for salaries , weapons , and training . 
They agreed on the need to tackle the growing drug traffic on the continent , a scourge that has the potential to bring down governments . 
End Summary . 
[LOC Somalia  ] ------- 2 . 
( C ) In his meeting with the [MISC Quai  ] d'Orsay 's top [LOC Africa  ] specialist , [PER A/S Carson  ] identified [LOC Somalia  ] as the principal concern for the [ORG USG  ] recently . 
He underscored [LOC U.S.  ] support for the [LOC Djibouti  ] peace process and the [ORG TFG  ] , noting that President [PER Sheikh Sharif  ] was " in a struggle for his existence . 
" Al-Shabaab is " ruthless and unrelenting " in their struggle to overthrow [PER Sharif  ] . 
In [PER Carson  ] 's estimation , now is the " last best chance " in the foreseeable future to restore stability in [LOC Somalia  ] . 
" If the [ORG TFG  ] fails , it will be a while before another political process is in place and capable of supplanting al-Shabaab , " he said . 
Even if al-Shabaab were to emerge victorious , they would eventually fragment , allowing al-Qaida to expand its presence in [LOC Somalia  ] , [PER Carson  ] said . 
3 . 
( C ) [PER Carson  ] continued that the unrest in [LOC Somalia  ] has spawned a refugee crisis in [LOC Kenya  ] , piracy in the [LOC Red Sea  ] , smuggling operations throughout [LOC East Africa  ] , and internal strife , the impacts of which are being felt across the region . 
[PER Carson  ] reviewed for [PER Gompertz  ] the amount and kind of assistance the [ORG USG  ] has provided to the [ORG TFG  ] , including cash to pay salaries and purchase weapons for [ORG TFG  ] forces . 
The [LOC United States  ] has also urged [MISC African  ] states , such as [LOC Uganda  ] , [LOC Burundi  ] , and [LOC Algeria  ] , to contribute personnel and other support to [ORG AMISOM  ] . 
The [ORG USG  ] has actively assisted [MISC Ugandan  ] and [MISC Burundian  ] troops to prepare them for their mission . 
For his part , [PER Gompertz  ] said that [LOC France  ] intended to train [MISC Somali  ] security forces in [LOC Djibouti  ] starting in August . 
4 . 
( C ) [PER Gompertz  ] asked whether [PER Carson  ] believed [ORG AU  ] member states would seek to impose sanctions on [LOC Eritrea  ] to punish it for supporting al-Shabaab . 
[PER Carson  ] acknowledged that [MISC African  ] states were increasingly worried about [LOC Eritrea  ] 's negative role . 
[LOC Mali  ] ---- 5 . 
( C ) [PER Gompertz  ] said [LOC France  ] 's greatest preoccupation in [LOC Africa  ] at the present time is [LOC Mali  ] , and this is because of the serious threat posed by al-Qaida in the [LOC Maghreb  ] . 
[LOC France  ] is still evaluating whether [LOC Mali  ] is at a turning point . 
The [ORG GOF  ] is supplying equipment , including two light aircraft , to President [PER Amadou Toumani Toure  ] to counter al-Qaida . 
[PER Carson  ] opined that [PER Toure  ] would do his best . 
He cautioned , however , that the [MISC Malians  ] should not make the mistake of targeting the [MISC Tuareg  ] as part of their campaign against al-Qaida . 
The [MISC Tuareg  ] problem is historically distinct and should be handled as such , [PER Carson  ] advised [PER Gompertz  ] . 
[PER Gompertz  ] agreed that it would be a big mistake to treat the two issues as one problem . 
[LOC Niger  ] ----- 6 . 
( C ) Developments in [LOC Niger  ] worry both [LOC France  ] and the [LOC United States  ] . 
President [PER Mamadou Tandja  ] 's attempts to change the constitution in order to extend his mandate do not bode well for [LOC Niger  ] , where the courts , public opinion , and even some in the military oppose [PER Tandja  ] . 
[PER Gompertz  ] said President [PER Sarkozy  ] is upset with [PER Tandja  ] for " infringing on the rules of democracy " and that [LOC France  ] fears a coup if [PER Tandja  ] persists . 
The [ORG AU  ] 's [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000558 002.2 OF 002 Commissioner for Peace and Security , [PER Ramtane Lamamra  ] , also has expressed his concern to the [MISC French  ] . 
[PER Carson  ] and [PER Gompertz  ] discussed the need for even stronger statements condemning [PER Tandja  ] 's attempt to change the constitution and possibly dispatching a special envoy to [LOC Niamey  ] to deliver a strong message to him . 
[LOC Madagascar  ] ---------- 7 . 
( C ) On [LOC Madagascar  ] , [PER Gompertz  ] made clear that his government does not want to harm the [MISC Malagasy  ] population and explained that [MISC French  ] humanitarian services will continue to be provided but only through [ORG NGOs  ] . 
[PER Carson  ] said [LOC U.S.  ] assistance has already been scaled back more than 40 percent and the [ORG Millennium Challenge Account  ] has been terminated . 
[PER Gompertz  ] signaled the approach of an [ORG International Contact Group  ] meeting as the next opportunity to bring the principal stakeholders together . 
Drug Trafficking ---------------- 8 . 
( C ) The meeting also contained a discussion on the growing narco-trafficking problem on the [MISC African  ] continent and how this scourge has had a deleterious effect on countries such as [LOC Guinea-Bissau  ] and [LOC Guinea  ] . 
Both sides conceded that their governments have neglected [LOC Guinea-Bissau  ] for the past decade and that greater engagement is called for . 
[PER Gompertz  ] urged the [ORG USG  ] to re-open its embassy in [LOC Bissau  ] . 
[PER Carson  ] agreed that an [MISC American  ] presence was needed . 
With regard to drug traffickers , [PER Carson  ] said the [LOC United States  ] has urged [MISC West African  ] states to turn over drug traffickers to the [LOC United States  ] and other western nations for prosecution . 
He cited the examples of [LOC Sierra Leone  ] and [LOC Cape Verde  ] where [MISC Latin American  ] traffickers have been delivered to the [LOC U.S.  ] justice system rather than being returned to their countries of origin . 
In a related issue , [PER Gompertz  ] expressed his country 's concern that consumption of crack cocaine may be on the rise in cities like [LOC Ouagadougou  ] and [LOC Bamako  ] , boding ill for future drug addiction problems in those countries . 
[LOC Guinea  ] ------ 9 . 
( C ) [PER Carson  ] opined that [LOC Guinea  ] 's coup leader , [PER Dadis Camara  ] , would not hold elections before the end of the year nor would he give up power . 
" He is not a transformational figure , " he said . 
The upcoming [ORG International Contact Group  ] meeting will cover ways of applying more pressure on the junta , [PER Gompertz  ] said . 
Both [PER Gompertz  ] and [PER Carson  ] assessed that [PER Dadis  ] was a volatile personality who had to be treated with care . 
[LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] ------------- 10 . 
( C ) On [LOC Cote d'Ivoire  ] , there was agreement that President [PER Laurent Gbagbo  ] likely will not deliver on his promise to hold elections by the end of the year , particularly if he determines that he may lose . 
11 . 
( U ) A/S [PER Carson  ] has approved this message .
