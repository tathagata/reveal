( C ) [ORG Summary: The Government  ] of the [LOC Netherlands  ] ( [ORG GONL  ] ) believes the existing [MISC Dutch  ] and [MISC British  ] loan agreements with [LOC Iceland  ] will be resoundingly defeated in a March 6 [MISC Icelandic  ] referendum . 
The [ORG GONL  ] therefore plans to offer the Government of [LOC Iceland  ] ( [ORG GOI  ] ) new interest terms on its loan during the week of February 22 in hopes of avoiding the referendum altogether . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] offer likely will entail an &interest holiday8 for part of the term of the loan , or changing the current fixed interest rate to a floating one . 
Regarding the confidential [ORG State Department  ] cable on the [ORG Icesave  ] issue that was leaked to the [MISC Icelandic  ] press on February 18 , the [ORG GONL  ] expressed no surprise , noting the continuous information leaks coming from [LOC Iceland  ] throughout the [ORG Icesave  ] debacle . 
End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Nicole Bollen  ] , Coordinator for [MISC Debt Issues  ] at the [ORG Dutch Ministry of Finance  ] , briefed ECONOFF February 19 on next steps in the [ORG Icesave  ] case . 
The [ORG GONL  ] , led by [ORG Finance  ] Minister [PER Wouter Bos  ] , has met with [MISC Icelandic  ] delegations several times in recent weeks to find a solution to the current impasse . 
The [ORG GONL  ] remains firm that it will accept nothing less than full repayment of the 1.3 billion euro ( USD 1.8 billion ) loan it issued to the [ORG GOI  ] in October 2008 to help the [ORG GOI  ] repay [MISC Dutch  ] deposit holders after the bankruptcy of [MISC Internet  ] bank [ORG Icesave  ] , part of the [MISC Icelandic  ] bank [ORG Landsbanki  ] ( ref A ) . 
The [MISC British  ] government similarly loaned [LOC Iceland  ] 2.5 billion pounds ( USD 3.5 billion ) to help repay its deposit holders . 
[LOC Iceland  ] , s parliament passed a bill in December setting out repayment terms for both loans , but President [PER Grimsson  ] refused to sign it on the grounds that the terms were overly harsh . 
His refusal triggered a national referendum on the deal scheduled for March 6. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [LOC Iceland  ] , s [ORG Finance  ] Minister [PER Sigfusson  ] , accompanied by leaders of the [LOC Independence  ] and Progressive opposition parties , met January 29 with [MISC Dutch  ] Finance Minister [PER Bos  ] and [ORG UK Financial Services Minister  ] Myners in The [ORG Hague  ] . 
At that meeting , the parties agreed upon &The [ORG Hague  ] Principles8 that must be met in any revised plan to repay the [MISC Dutch  ] ( and [MISC British  ] ) loans . 
These principles are ( 1 ) full repayment of principal , ( 2 ) a concise proposal , ( 3 ) a quick end to negotiations ( i.e. before the March 6 referendum ) , and ( 4 ) united &cross-party8 political support in [LOC Iceland  ] . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The presence of [MISC Icelandic  ] opposition parliamentarians in the meeting was intended to demonstrate that &cross-party8 support that the [MISC Dutch  ] and [MISC British  ] require for any successful renegotiation of the loan terms . 
End note . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [MISC Icelandic  ] finance officials and opposition parliamentarians subsequently presented new options to their [LOC UK  ] and [MISC Dutch  ] counterparts in meetings in [LOC London  ] on February 15 and 16 . 
According to [PER Bollen  ] ( who did not attend the meetings ) , the first proposal offered by the [ORG GOI  ] on February 15 was &outrageous.8 It did not guarantee full repayment of principal and offered no interest payments at all . 
The second proposal on February 16 was only &slightly better , 8 with the [ORG GOI  ] offering to repay principal ) over a long period of time ) but no interest payments . 
The [ORG GONL  ] Qperiod of time ) but no interest payments . 
The [ORG GONL  ] rejected both offers on the grounds that ( 1 ) they did not meet the agreed-upon [ORG &Hague Principles  ] , 8 and ( 2 ) the refusal to pay interest set a dangerous and unacceptable precedent for sovereign debt and other key [ORG Paris Club  ] issues. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) According to [PER Bollen  ] , the [ORG GONL  ] believes the existing loan agreements with the [LOC Netherlands  ] and [LOC UK  ] will be resoundingly defeated in the March 6 [MISC Icelandic  ] referendum . 
This will require the governments of [LOC Iceland  ] , the [LOC Netherlands  ] , and the [LOC UK  ] to effectively to start over with negotiating new repayment terms . 
To avoid this scenario , the [ORG GONL  ] is seeking a solution now that would obviate the need for the referendum . 
We &must get clear of this , 8 said [PER Bollen  ] ; &the entire issue has gotten way out of hand and has become silly and destructive.8 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Bollen  ] said the [ORG GONL  ] therefore plans to &make an offer8 to the [ORG GOI  ] during the week of February 22 . 
The [ORG GONL  ] is willing to negotiate on interest payments , but not the core &Hague [PER Principles.8 Bollen  ] indicated that options could include changing the current fixed interest rate of 5.55 percent to a floating rate for part of the repayment period . 
Another option could be an &interest holiday8 for part of [LOC Iceland  ] , s seven-year grace period on the debt. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Regarding the confidential [ORG State Department  ] cable on the [ORG Icesave  ] issue that was leaked to the [MISC Icelandic  ] press on February 18 ( ref B ) , [PER Bollen  ] said she was not surprised at all . 
She described [LOC Iceland  ] as a &sieve8 in which information leaks are standard practice. &Every time we have a confidential discussion with [MISC Icelandic  ] officials , we read about it the next day in the press.8 <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Bollen  ] will represent the [LOC Netherlands  ] in the [ORG Paris Club  ] meetings on February 22-25 in [LOC Paris  ] . 
She noted that she has discussed [ORG Icesave  ] developments regularly with [ORG U.S. Treasury  ] and [ORG State Department  ] reps at recent [ORG Paris Club  ] meetings ; she will seek them out again during next week , s meeting and update them on developments .
