[ORG USEU BRUSSELS  ] 4009 Classified By: Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary:  ] The recent defection of one member of parliament from the [MISC Liberal  ] ( [ORG VVD  ] ) party over the issue of [MISC Turkish  ] accession to the [ORG EU  ] is forcing the [MISC Dutch  ] government to consider potential domestic repercussions of the [MISC Turkish  ] [ORG EU  ] debate . 
So far , PM [PER Balkenende  ] has set the tone of the discussion by stressing that a " " deal is a deal , " " and the coalition cabinet has demonstrated admirable discipline in toeing this line . 
As several critical dates approach , however , domestic political debate is expected to heat up considerably . 
End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The debate over [LOC Turkey  ] is sharpening as a starting date for accession talks looms and opponents speak out . 
Recent think tank and panel reports and a public squabble between [MISC Liberal  ] [ORG MP  ] 's in the [LOC Netherlands  ] are making it harder for Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] 's government to continue framing the issue as a neutral question of logic and fairness - " " if " " [LOC Turkey  ] fulfills the political [LOC Copenhagen  ] criteria , " " then " " the [ORG EU  ] will fulfill its side of the bargain by opening negotiations on accession . 
This strategy has been inherently strengthened by the [MISC Dutch  ] government 's efforts to portray itself as a neutral " " honest broker " " during the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG EU  ] presidency . 
Domestic Politics in [LOC Flux  ] ------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) In a major falling out , the [ORG VVD  ] ( conservative liberal party and junior partner in the coalition ) recently expelled mid-level [ORG MP  ] [PER Geert Wilders  ] for his vociferous anti-Turkey stance and refusal to toe the party line favoring [LOC Turkey  ] . 
It may have ended his mainstream career , however , recent polls suggest he could head a list of parliamentary candidates today and capture between four and nine seats in the second chamber . 
[PER Marnix Krop  ] , Director General for [ORG EU  ] affairs at the [ORG MFA  ] , told the [ORG DCM  ] recently that [PER Wilders  ] could springboard to prominence by arousing difficult-to-manage populist sentiments based on deeply held fears and prejudices . 
This would repeat the experience of the late [PER Pim Fortuyn  ] whose far-right [ORG LPF  ] , now in disarray , was founded on anti-immigrant feelings. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) A more immediate concern for the [MISC Dutch  ] government is the impact the [MISC Wilders'  ] affair could have on the ruling coalition . 
Interestingly , [PER Wilder  ] 's challenge appears to have pushed the [ORG VVD  ] -- traditionally [MISC Euro-  ] and Turkey-skeptics -- to clarify its position on [LOC Turkey  ] in favor of the Government 's line . 
While the cabinet remains united , the parties themselves are clearly worried about public anti-Turkish accession sentiments . 
Following the [MISC Wilders'  ] debacle , [ORG VVD  ] Chief [PER Jozias Van Aartsen  ] publicly stated that the [ORG VVD  ] " " unanimously " " supported the Government 's position , but also left the door open to suggestions that the issue could be put to a referendum in the ( distant ) future . 
A senior spokesman in the PM 's own party confided recently that a majority of [ORG CDA  ] members would vote against [MISC Turkish  ] accession if given the opportunity " " to vote their conscience . 
" " Opinion Makers Lining Up on Both Sides , with Public Opinion Still Coalescing --------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [MISC Dutch  ] government has not commented officially on any of the recently published think pieces and advisory panel reports that have come down on both sides of the [LOC Turkey  ] question . 
They await instead the October 6 [ORG Commission  ] report , which will " " actually have an impact " " on [ORG EU  ] decision making <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) At the September 8 presentation of the [ORG Ahtisaari Commission  ] report in The [MISC Hague  ] , [MISC European  ] Ambassadors , senior diplomats and representatives from academia worried that the [ORG EU  ] politicians and media have failed in their duty to build a solid public case for [LOC Turkey  ] . 
This is certainly the case in the [LOC Netherlands  ] , where the leadership 's " " deal is a deal " " argument has only limited resonance outside official circles . 
The recent flap over [LOC Turkey  ] 's adultery law has not helped . 
Emboffs' recent informal discussions with [MISC Dutch  ] colleagues , from a range of backgrounds and interests , reveal anger and frustration over [LOC Turkey  ] . 
Worry based on substantive issues seems equally matched by anger over being railroaded by politicians to accept a preset plan , come what may . 
Tie-in to the [MISC Constitutional Referenda  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Several observers , including [PER Krop  ] , noted that [MISC Dutch  ] voters could punish politicians by rejecting the [LOC Treaty of Constitution  ] in the tentative March 2005 referendum if they feel an unpopular decision on [LOC Turkey  ] was foisted upon them . 
If turnout is low -- as it generally is for [MISC EU-related  ] votes -- then a small , motivated group could influence the result and use this " " success " " as a springboard for broader political ambitions . 
( This is one of the scenarios some feel [PER Wilders  ] may be pursuing . 
) The referendum is the first in [MISC Dutch  ] history and its legal status remains somewhat vague . 
Nevertheless , the government would not be able to ignore an expression of public will on a vital issue The [ORG Commission Report  ] --------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) At least until the recent set back of the penal code reform in [LOC Turkey  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] officials privately encouraged us to expect a " " positive " " [ORG EU Commission  ] report on October 6 . 
[MISC Dutch  ] FM Bot told Ambassador [PER Sobel  ] recently that the " " impact statement " " would be a important element in determining how the public approaches [MISC Turkish  ] accession talks . 
The impact statement would address central worries , such as how the [ORG EU  ] will share structural , agricultural and solidarity benefits with [LOC Turkey  ] , assuming these programs will look the same then as they do now . 
Bot noted ( based on his discussions with Commissioner [PER Verheugen  ] ) that the impact statement might include some " " surprises " " that would help make it easier to deal with public fears . 
On the main report itself , in a meeting on September 10 with [MISC EUR/ERA  ] Director [PER Peter Chase  ] and the [ORG DCM  ] , [PER Jaap Werner  ] said the question for the [MISC Dutch  ] government is not just whether [LOC Turkey  ] gets a " " yes , " " but what extra " " tools are put around it... . 
No new tests but what accompanying measures " " to assuage public concerns . 
He admitted that the [ORG EU  ] is not above " temporization , including proposing a longer period to negotiate .
