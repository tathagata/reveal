End Summary . 
[LOC U.S.  ] Message: Capturing Fugitives Essential -------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( U ) Ambassador [PER Rapp  ] met with [MISC Serbian  ] President [PER Boris Tadic  ] , [ORG Serbian National Council for Cooperation  ] with the [ORG International Criminal Tribunal  ] for the [LOC Former Yugoslavia  ] ( [ORG ICTY  ] ) Chairman [PER Rasim Ljajic  ] , [ORG War Crimes Prosecutor  ] [PER Vladimir Vukcevic  ] , [ORG War Crimes Special Court  ] President [PER Sinisa Vazic  ] , and [MISC War Crimes Investigations Service Chief  ] [PER Aleksandar Kostic  ] in [LOC Belgrade  ] on October 16. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador [PER Rapp  ] emphasized to all of his interlocutors that cooperation with the [ORG ICTY  ] , in particular handing over the remaining two fugitives , [PER Ratko Mladic  ] and [PER Goran Hadzic  ] remained essential . 
He added that while he would give his assessment of [MISC Serbia’s  ] efforts to [PER Brammertz  ] , capturing [PER Mladic  ] was the ultimate solution to making progress on [ORG EU  ] accession . 
The Ambassador also conveyed the USG’s willingness to help [LOC Serbia  ] in any way possible , pointing to the recently completed [ORG FBI  ] assessment as a sign of [ORG USG  ] commitment . 
Ambassador [PER Rapp  ] suggested there might be other ways the [LOC United States  ] could help , such as tracking financial support to [PER Mladic  ] . 
[PER Tadic  ] Meeting ------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) President [PER Tadic  ] told Ambassador [PER Rapp  ] that those who likely were hiding [PER Mladic  ] had links to organized crime and wealth attributable to ‘90’s wartime profiteering . 
[PER Tadic  ] therefore was enthusiastic about his intelligence services’ cooperation with the [ORG U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency  ] in the recent capture of 2.8 tons of cocaine off the coast of [LOC Uruguay  ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes-article.p hp ? yyyy=2009&mm=10&dd= 19&nav_id=62454 ) . 
This seizure would open the door to arrests of a number of organized crime figures in [LOC Serbia  ] , as well as in [LOC Montenegro  ] and [LOC Bosnia-Herzegovina  ] , he said , and perhaps shake the trees of the organized crime elements involved with shielding [PER Mladic  ] . 
[PER Tadic  ] said he hoped to increase and expand [LOC U.S.  ] intelligence and security links in order to bolster [MISC Serbia’s  ] role as a pillar of stability in the region. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Referring to the recent [ORG FBI  ] assessment , [PER Tadic  ] thanked Ambassador [PER Rapp  ] and the [ORG USG  ] for offering the assistance and said [LOC Serbia  ] very much welcomed the help . 
[PER Tadic  ] expressed his frustration with the [MISC Dutch  ] position on blocking [MISC Serbian  ] accession to the [ORG EU  ] until [PER Mladic  ] and [PER Hadzic  ] were apprehended and turned over [LOC BELGRADE  ] 00001222 002.2 OF 003 to The [ORG Hague.  ] “My people are starting to ask me what I have delivered in terms of [ORG EU  ] accession and as long as the [MISC Dutch  ] block us , they are adding to the ammunition of the opposition , i.e. , the [MISC Serbian  ] Progressive [PER Party.” Tadic  ] said he also was frustrated with the role his former Prime Minister [PER Vojislav Kostunica’s Democratic Party  ] of [LOC Serbia  ] ( [ORG DSS  ] ) had played in hiding information about [PER Mladic  ] from Tadic. “I believe they have violated our law , ” he said , “and when [PER Mladic  ] is caught , we will prove that.” Summing up , [PER Tadic  ] said , “we are counting on the [LOC United States  ] to help us.” <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In response Ambassador [PER Rapp  ] said he doubted the [MISC Dutch  ] position would change without the capture of [PER Mladic  ] . 
He encouraged the president to emphasize the atmospherics in [LOC Serbia  ] surrounding [PER Mladic  ] and the war crimes tribunal in general. “You need to get out the message that the court is good , and members of the government need to speak respectfully of the institution.” [PER Fugitive Hunt  ] ------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Other [MISC Serbian  ] officials told Ambassador [PER Rapp  ] that it was the government’s priority to deliver the two remaining fugitives to The [ORG Hague Tribunal  ] and thus close this painful chapter of [MISC Serbia’s  ] history . 
[ORG ICTY Cooperation Chair Ljajic  ] and others asked for [ORG USG  ] assistance convincing the [MISC Dutch  ] of [MISC Serbia’s  ] efforts . 
[PER Ljajic  ] said that the government was in a difficult position , with no support for [ORG ICTY  ] cooperation among a public which saw it as simply an extra condition for [ORG EU  ] accession ; what he described as “enormous international pressure” made it more difficult to explain the need for cooperation to the public . 
Ambassador [PER Rapp  ] told [PER Ljajic  ] it was important that government officials not speak out against the ICTY’s decisions , because doing so sent the wrong message . 
[PER Ljajic  ] said the [ORG ICTY  ] was very unpopular and had issued many strange decisions , such as seemingly extra harsh sentences for [MISC Serbs  ] such as [PER Lukic  ] , although he agreed the message had to be balanced . 
[PER Ljajic  ] added that on other issues of [ORG ICTY  ] cooperation , [LOC Serbia  ] was fulfilling all requests for witness subpoenas , witness protection , and archive access. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Despite many challenges , the [ORG Action Team  ] responsible for capturing [PER Mladic  ] and [PER Hadzic  ] would be successful because of its efforts , officials told Ambassador [PER Rapp  ] . 
Difficulties included the years that had passed since the former government had had good information on the fugitives’ whereabouts in 2006 , the likelihood that both had altered their appearance and were using false identities , the vast number of useless tips called into the police that had to be investigated , difficulties tracking how the fugitives communicated with family , and financial support , according to war crimes police head [PER Kostic  ] and war crimes prosecutor [PER Vukcevic  ] . 
[PER Kostic  ] noted that [PER Radovan Karadzic  ] had been supporting himself with only 450 [MISC Euros  ] a month immediately prior to his apprehension in 2008 . 
[PER Ljajic  ] said the [ORG Action Team  ] had approached [LOC Russia  ] for help on both fugitives , since there was evidence they had travelled to or contemplated travel to [LOC Russia  ] . 
Domestic [MISC War Crimes Trials  ] -------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ambassador Rapp’s interlocutors also noted the successes of [MISC Serbia’s  ] domestic war crimes trials in the [MISC Serbian  ] [ORG War Crimes Special Court  ] . 
They all expressed thanks for the USG’s strong and continuing support to the court and the police [MISC War Crimes Investigation Service  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Rapp  ] noted the importance of having trials in national courts , which facilitated reconciliation . 
[PER Kostic  ] said the domestic trials had been important in helping the [MISC Serbian  ] public understand that [MISC Serbs  ] had committed war crimes and not just been victims of them . 
Ambassador [PER Rapp  ] told Judge [PER Vazic  ] he was concerned that the [ORG Supreme Court  ] had overturned many of the Special Court’s convictions . 
[PER Vazic  ] noted that [ORG Supreme Court  ] judges [LOC BELGRADE  ] 00001222 003.2 OF 003 lacked the specialized training to understand war crimes cases . 
Under provisions of the judicial reform package ( Ref A ) , the [ORG Appeals Courts  ] would hear war crimes appeals and those judges would be required to obtain training , resulting in better appeals outcomes . 
Ambassador [PER Rapp  ] asked [PER Vukcevic  ] about the acquittals in the [LOC Bytyqi  ] trial for killings of three [MISC American  ] citizen brothers ( Ref B ) . 
[PER Vukcevic  ] said his office would appeal the acquittals . 
Both he and [PER Kostic  ] noted the difficulties getting police with information on the case to talk . 
[ORG Regional Cooperation  ] -------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [ORG Regional  ] cooperation on war crimes was mixed , officials told Ambassador [PER Rapp  ] . 
While [PER Kostic  ] said cooperation with [LOC EULEX  ] , the [MISC Croatian  ] police , and [MISC Bosnian  ] intelligence services had helped collect evidence on the [ORG ICTY  ] fugitives , [PER Ljajic  ] said the monthly meetings with regional intelligence agencies were no longer useful , and he asked for [ORG USG  ] support in emphasizing the need for cooperation in the fugitive search . 
On domestic cases , [PER Vukcevic  ] noted that evidence transfer agreements with [LOC Croatia  ] and [LOC Montenegro  ] had been successful , helping [LOC Serbia  ] to try 28 cases with evidence transferred from [LOC Croatia  ] ; USG-aided efforts to establish a similar agreement with [LOC Bosnia  ] had stalled , however . 
A key problem , [PER Vukcevic  ] said , was that [LOC Bosnia  ] wanted to try those cases in which the crimes had occurred in [LOC Bosnia  ] , whereas [LOC Serbia  ] wanted to try individuals who were present in [LOC Serbia  ] and could not be extradited because of the lack of extradition agreements . 
[LOC Serbia  ] had just passed a law allowing extradition if a bilateral agreement existed , but [LOC Croatia  ] and [LOC Bosnia  ] still had constitutional prohibitions . 
In the meantime , evidence transfer was the only way to prosecute these cases , said [PER Vukcevic  ] . 
Ambassador [PER Rapp  ] pledged his office’s continuing support to the negotiations with [LOC Bosnia  ] and to other regional cooperation efforts . 
Comment ------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Conversations with [MISC Serbian  ] officials confirmed that [LOC Serbia  ] is making strong efforts to capture the fugitives , but officials involved in the fugitive search know that they need a lucky break that could come soon or not . 
[MISC Serbian  ] officials were clearly hoping Ambassador [PER Rapp  ] would attempt to convince the [MISC Dutch  ] to drop their objections to implementation of [MISC Serbia’s  ] Stabilization and [ORG Association Agreement  ] . 
With the exception of [ORG ICTY Cooperation Chair Ljajic  ] , who frequently speaks publicly about the importance of [ORG ICTY  ] cooperation , interlocutors did not respond to Ambassador Rapp’s message that public sentiment about [ORG ICTY  ] cooperation would not change without strong messages from the leadership . 
The visit also highlighted the need to continue to work with governments in the region to improve cooperation on the fugitive search and on domestic trials .
