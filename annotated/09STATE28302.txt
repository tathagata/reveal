[PER Anita Friedt  ] , Reason 1.4 ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) ---------- BACKGROUND ----------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S//NF  ] ) [MISC Venezuelan  ] officials expected to receive a shipment of unmanned aerial vehicles ( [ORG UAV  ] ) and related material from [LOC Iran  ] , via [LOC Turkey  ] , by May 2009 . 
As of early March , [MISC Venezuelan  ] officials believed that the equipment would be repackaged and labeled as electronic equipment , then transported overland from [LOC Iran  ] to [LOC Turkey  ] . 
Once in [LOC Turkey  ] , the equipment would be loaded onto a maritime vessel for continued shipment to [LOC Venezuela  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] believes this shipment constitutes arms and related materiel , which [LOC Iran  ] is prohibited from transferring pursuant to [ORG UN Security Council Resolution  ] 1747 , paragraph 5. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) This case appears to be similar to one from January 2009 where [LOC Iran  ] attempted to ship drums of nitrate and sulphite chemicals and dismantled laboratory instruments , which could possibly be used for making bombs to [LOC Venezuela  ] via [LOC Turkey  ] . 
In response to [LOC U.S.  ] concerns that the shipment may have been a violation of [ORG UNSCR  ] 1747 , [MISC Turkish  ] officials inspected the cargo and made a decision to return it to [LOC Iran  ] . 
( [ORG REFS A  ] and B ) -------------- ACTION REQUEST -------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) Drawing from the points in paragraph 5 , which may be left as a nonpaper , post is instructed to approach appropriate-level [MISC Turkish  ] officials and request that they investigate this activity , and if the cargo is found to be in violation of [ORG UNSCR  ] 1747 that the [ORG GOT  ] use all available means to prevent the transshipment of this cargo and detain it. ---------- OBJECTIVES ---------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) Post should seek to achieve the following: -- Provide [MISC Turkish  ] officials with information regarding [LOC Iran  ] , s attempt to ship unmanned aerial vehicles ( [MISC UAVs  ] ) and related material to [LOC Venezuela  ] via [LOC Turkey  ] ; -- Emphasize to the [MISC Turkish  ] officials that [ORG UN Security Council Resolution  ] ( [ORG UNSCR  ] ) 1747 , paragraph 5 , prohibits [LOC Iran  ] from transferring any arms or related materiel ; -- Emphasize that these goods are produced by an [MISC Iranian  ] entity listed in the [ORG Annex  ] to [ORG UNSCR  ] 1747 . 
-- Urge the Government of [LOC Turkey  ] ( [ORG GOT  ] ) to take action against this shipment pursuant to [ORG UNSCR  ] 1747 and possibly 1737 , and in accordance with the [ORG GOT  ] 's laws and authorities ; -- Thank the [ORG GOT  ] for its willingness to interdict and take positive action with regards to a similar shipment in January . 
As a [MISC NATO Ally  ] , we try to provide [LOC Turkey  ] with as much info as possible on these issues , which could help lead them to take action in detaining shipments ; and -- Emphasized that , should we receive additional information regarding this shipment , we will provide it as expeditiously as possible. ------------------------ TALKING POINTS/NON-PAPER ------------------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S//REL [LOC Turkey  ] ) [PER Begin  ] talking points/non-paper: --We would like to share some information with you in an effort to highlight a transfer of proliferation concern and to ensure that [LOC Iran  ] does not make use of your territory to transfer items proscribed by [ORG UN Security Council  ] resolutions 1737 , 1747 , and 1803 . 
-- The [LOC U.S.  ] has information indicating that [MISC Venezuelan  ] officials expected to receive a shipment of [ORG UAV  ] and UAV-related equipment from [LOC Iran  ] by May 2009 . 
-- As of early March , [MISC Venezuelan  ] officials believed that the equipment would be repackaged and labeled as electronic equipment , then transported overland from [LOC Iran  ] to [LOC Turkey  ] . 
Once in [LOC Turkey  ] , the equipment would be loaded onto a maritime vessel for continued shipment to [LOC Venezuela.  ] --Venezuelan officials assessed that a shipment of electronics coming from [LOC Turkey  ] to [LOC Venezuela  ] would be less alerting than a shipment directly from [LOC Iran.  ] --We believe these items are military [MISC UAVs  ] and related items , constituting arms and related materials and are thus captured by [ORG UNSCR  ] 1747 and subject to the asset freeze called for in [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737 . 
-- [ORG UN Security Council Resolution  ] 1747 , paragraph 5 , prohibits [LOC Iran  ] from supplying , selling or transferring any arms or related materiel . 
It also requires all states to prohibit the procurement of such items from [LOC Iran  ] by their nationals , or using their flag vessels or aircraft , and whether or not such transfers originated in the territory of [LOC Iran.  ] --This system is produced by the [ORG Qods Aviation Industries  ] . 
-- [ORG Qods Aeronautics Industries  ] ( aka [ORG Qods Aviations Industries  ] ) is designated in the [ORG Annex  ] to [ORG UNSCR  ] 1747 and as such these items would be subject to the asset freeze provision of [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737 regardless of whether the item is MTCR- controlled or otherwise prohibited in paragraphs 3 or 4 of the resolution . 
-- As such , we request your assistance in preventing the transfer of goods in violation of [ORG UNSCR  ] 1747 and 1737 . 
-- Additionally , it is possible that some UAV-related equipment may be [MISC MTCR-controlled  ] , per [ORG MTCR Item  ] 12.A.1. , if the equipment is designed or modified to support other [MISC Iranian  ] UAVs that meet the Item 1.A.2. or 19.A.2. criteria . 
Such items are included in document S/2006/815 , the list of items , materials , equipment , goods and technology related to ballistic missile programs . 
Transfer of these items would be a violation of [ORG UNSCR  ] 1737 per paragraph 3 . 
-- We deeply appreciate the Government of [LOC Turkey  ] 's continued cooperation , support and willingness to enact prompt and thorough efforts in promoting interdictions designed to prevent the transfer of sensitive materials by [LOC Iran  ] .
