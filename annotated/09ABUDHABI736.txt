( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary . 
On July 15 , Treasury Secretary [PER Timothy Geithner  ] joined [LOC Abu Dhabi  ] Crown Prince Sheikh [PER Mohammed  ] bin [MISC Zayed  ] al [PER Nahyan  ] ( [ORG MBZ  ] ) and Foreign Minister [PER Sheikh Abdullah  ] bin [MISC Zayed  ] al [PER Nahyan  ] ( [ORG ABZ  ] ) for a dinner covering a range of regional issues . 
[ORG MBZ  ] expressed serious concern over [LOC Iran  ] 's regional intentions and pleaded for the [LOC U.S.  ] to shorten its decision-making timeline and develop a " plan B . 
" He encouraged the [LOC U.S.  ] to clearly communicate 'red lines' to the [MISC Iranian  ] Government , on nuclear and regional stability issues , with direct consequences for transgressions . 
He painted to a nuclear [LOC Iran  ] as an existential threat to the [LOC UAE  ] and invoked the well being of his grandchildren while urging the [LOC U.S.  ] to act quickly . 
[ORG MBZ  ] asked for close coordination between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC UAE  ] to deal with the [MISC Iranian  ] threat . 
End Summary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Secretary [PER Geithner  ] asked the Crown Prince for his views on the situation in the region , particularly in [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Geithner  ] described the [LOC U.S.  ] strategy on [LOC Iran  ] , including our intention to move forward with multilateral financial sanctions while waiting for [LOC Iran  ] to decide on its engagement with the [LOC U.S.  ] He also conveyed appreciation for the important support that [LOC UAE  ] provides to other regional trouble spots. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG MBZ  ] described a nuclear armed [LOC Iran  ] as absolutely untenable . 
He pointed to [LOC Iran  ] 's relentless ambitions to restore regional hegemony as evidenced by destabilizing interference in [LOC Iraq  ] , [LOC Lebanon  ] , [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Palestine  ] . 
He believes that 'all hell will break loose' if [LOC Iran  ] attains the bomb , with [LOC Egypt  ] , [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] , [LOC Syria  ] and [LOC Turkey  ] developing their own nuclear weapons capability and [LOC Iran  ] instigating [MISC Sunni  ] - [LOC Shia  ] conflict throughout the world . 
He said [LOC Iran  ] is surrounding [LOC Israel  ] - driven by ideological conviction - and will threaten [LOC Israel  ] 's existence should it go nuclear . 
At the same time , he described [LOC Iran  ] 's ambitions as reflecting a desire to restore [LOC Persia  ] 's great-power status , rather than driven by religious convictions. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG MBZ  ] differentiated the long term threat posed by [LOC Iran  ] from other menacing states like [LOC North Korea  ] or [LOC Syria  ] . 
Where these other regimes were ruled by small cadres of corrupt 'old guard' officials , the [MISC Iranian  ] regime has raised its next generation to carry out its designs for hegemony . 
As such , the world will be dealing with [LOC Iran  ] 's destabilizing ambitions for decades . 
[ORG MBZ  ] assesses that the [MISC Iranian  ] regime has emerged from the recent election strife stronger and more resolute. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) While careful not to suQY.JQoWoRth [LOC Iran  ] , [ORG MBZ  ] described a near term conventional war with [LOC Iran  ] as clearly preferable to the long term consequences of a nuclear armed [LOC Iran  ] . 
Without timely and decisive action by the [LOC United States  ] , [ORG MBZ  ] believes that [LOC Israel  ] will strike [LOC Iran  ] , causing [LOC Iran  ] to launch missile attacks - including hits on the [LOC UAE  ] - and to unleash terror attacks worldwide . 
In his view , 'the map of the [ORG Middle East'  ] would change . 
He expects widespread civilian conflict to erupt as [LOC Iran  ] sparks [MISC Sunni  ] - [LOC Shia  ] violence worldwide ( including the [ORG Eastern Province of  ] [LOC Saudi Arabia  ] which he sees as the greatest vulnerability , along with [LOC Iraq  ] , in the [MISC Arab  ] world ) . 
He speculated that such an event could unfold within six months time and resolved that the [LOC UAE  ] is prepared to defend itself . 
He believes that an [MISC Israeli  ] strike will not be successful in stopping [LOC Iran  ] 's nuclear program , and therefore we need to plan. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Regarding the recent election in [LOC Iran  ] , [ORG MBZ  ] cautioned that Mir [PER Hossein Musavi  ] is no different than [PER Ahmedinejad  ] when it comes to their nuclear ambitions , 's ame goal , different tactic.' 
In this respect , he regards [PER Musavi  ] as more dangerous than his competitor , as at least [MISC Ahmedinejad  ] was 'an open book.' 
He reminded Secretary [PER Geithner  ] that [PER Musavi  ] and his advisors are part of the same group that took the [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy in 1979. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG MBZ  ] questioned [LOC Europe  ] 's basic understanding of the threat posed by [LOC Iran  ] , and wrote off their resolve to deal with the situation . 
He was appalled by 'top [MISC European  ] diplomats' that were unconcerned by the possibility of [LOC Iran  ] acquiring a nuclear weapon . 
He shared his theory that [LOC Russia  ] was trying to instigate conflict between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Iran  ] as a means to weaken the [LOC U.S.  ] and drive up oil prices . 
He suggested we could use [LOC Russia  ] 's narrow views to help persuade [LOC Russia  ] to join international actions against [LOC Iran.  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG MBZ  ] stated that financial sanctions would never be sufficient to stop [LOC Iran  ] , but allowed that the [LOC U.S.  ] should continue with such measures to demonstrate to the [MISC Arab  ] world that we tried everything . 
He pledged continued cooperation and support for international sanctions and encouraged further action in the [ORG UN  ] and [ORG EU  ] , as well as the [LOC U.S.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG MBZ  ] suggested that the key to containing [LOC Iran  ] revolves around progress in the [LOC Israel/Palestine  ] issue . 
He argued that it will be essential to bring [MISC Arab  ] public opinion on board in any conflict with [LOC Iran  ] and roughly 80% of the public is amenable to persuasion . 
To win them over , the [LOC U.S.  ] should quickly bring about a two state solution over the objections of the [MISC Netanyahu  ] government . 
He suggested working with moderate [MISC Palestinians  ] that support the road map , and forget about the others as there is no time to waste. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Foreign Minister [ORG ABZ  ] urged the [LOC U.S.  ] to make better use of its allies in the region and engage [LOC Russia  ] and [LOC China  ] in a productive way on this issue wherever possible . 
He urged clear and forceful messaging to [LOC Iran  ] and more regional gatherings ( i.e . 
P+5+1 and GCC+3 ) to increase pressure and isolation. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) ACTION REQUEST: [ORG MBZ  ] would like to visit [LOC Washington  ] in late July to discuss [LOC Iran  ] with President [PER Obama  ] and other senior officials . 
[ORG Treasury  ] and Embassy recommend continuing the dialogue with [ORG MBZ  ] as soon as possible. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) This cable has been cleared by [PER Andy Baukol  ] , [ORG Department of Treasury Acting Assistant  ] Secretary for International Affairs .
