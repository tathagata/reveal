<code><pre>S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 04 [LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 000454 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 03/02/2034 TAGS PREL , PTER , PGOV , PK SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR [ORG FBI  ] DIRECTOR MUELLER Classified By: [PER Anne W. Patterson  ] for reasons 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) [MISC Summary: Mission Pakistan  ] warmly welcomes your arrival in [LOC Islamabad  ] . 
You are arriving in the midst of largely self-inflicted political turmoil following the [ORG Supreme Court’s  ] decision to disqualify from public office [PER Nawaz  ] and [PER Shahbaz Sharif  ] , political rivals of President [PER Asif Zardari  ] . 
[PER Zardari  ] engineered the [MISC Sharifs’  ] disqualification and followed that with placing his party’s governor in power in the [LOC Punjab  ] provincial government to replace [PER Shahbaz Sharif  ] . 
At the moment , there are multiple efforts to reconcile [PER Zardari  ] with the [LOC Sharifs  ] and to elect a replacement for Chief Minister [LOC Punjab  ] . 
Unless the [LOC Punjab  ] issue is resolved by March 12 , a planned lawyers’ demonstration-that is backed by the Sharifs--could become violent . 
You thus will find your interlocutors distracted by domestic politics at a time when the [MISC GOP  ] is struggling to meet [MISC IMF-imposed  ] fiscal targets and militants are increasing their control over both the tribal areas and Swat , a once idyllic tourist destination 90 miles from [LOC Islamabad.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) You will be meeting with key interlocutors in our efforts to press the [MISC GOP  ] for prosecution of the [LOC Mumbai  ] detainees , assistance in effecting the release of kidnapped [MISC Americans  ] [PER John Solecki  ] and [PER David Rohde  ] , and expanding law and order cooperation . 
The issue of [ORG FBI  ] access to the [LOC Mumbai  ] suspects remains very sensitive ; a decision to send an investigative team to New [LOC Delhi  ] currently rests on whether/how [LOC India  ] responds to [ORG Pakistan’s  ] 32 requests for additional information . 
President [PER Zardari  ] has over-reached in this current political crisis , but he remains secular , pro-American and our best ally in [LOC Pakistan  ] right now . 
He likely will assure you that he has established a new anti-terrorism court that will deliver convictions on [LOC Mumbai  ] . 
[PER Zardari  ] will request additional USG support for the [ORG Northwest Frontier Province  ] ( [ORG NWFP  ] ) police ; we will brief you on our train and equip plans for this critical part of our counter-terrorism strategy. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) DG ISI [LOC Pasha  ] , whom you met in last week’s bilateral and trilateral strategic review in [LOC Washington  ] , continues to profess a determination to end ISI’s overt and tacit support for proxy forces in the tribal areas , [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Kashmir  ] . 
Interior Minister [PER Malik  ] is [PER Zardari’s  ] point man on law and order and also serves as a political negotiator . 
[PER Malik  ] is very supportive of the [LOC U.S.  ] , but he wants to control every key issue personally , making it difficult for his staff to take any decisions without his approval . 
[ORG Intelligence Bureau  ] ( [ORG IB  ] ) Director General Suddle was personally selected for the job by [PER Zardari  ] ; after a bungled attempt to place ISI under the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] , [PER Zardari  ] brought [ORG IB  ] firmly under his control . 
[ORG Federal Investigative Agency  ] ( [ORG FIA  ] ) Director General [PER Tariq Khosa  ] is a well-respected cop , but he must work through [PER MOI Malik  ] . 
End Summary . 
Domestic Situation ------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The civilian government headed by President [PER Asif Zardari  ] and Prime Minister [PER Yousaf Gilani  ] , elected one year ago , has been fairly stable . 
However , President [PER Zardari  ] has been preoccupied with his political rival former Prime Minister [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] . 
On February 25 , [ORG Pakistan’s Supreme Court  ] ruled that both [PER Nawaz  ] and his brother [PER Shahbaz Sharif  ] are ineligible to hold public office ; [PER Zardari  ] followed that decision by appointing his party’s governor to rule in the [LOC Punjab  ] ( [ORG Pakistan’s  ] most important province ) pending elections to replace [PER Shahbaz Sharif  ] as Chief Minister . 
This has sparked country-wide protests and general political unrest . 
[PER Nawaz Sharif  ] is by far the most popular politician in [LOC Pakistan  ] ( with an 83% approval rating compared to [PER Zardari’s  ] 20% in the latest [ORG IRI  ] poll ) , but he does not have the votes to bring down the government . 
Instead , [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] is using popular outrage at the [ORG Supreme Court  ] decision and “governor’s rule” to launch street protests . 
[PER Zardari  ] may win the short-term tactical battle against [PER Nawaz  ] ; however , [PER Nawaz  ] is gaining ground by comparing [PER Zardari’s  ] high-handed rule to that of former President [PER Musharraf  ] . 
[PER Nawaz Sharif  ] is inspiring street demonstrations to coincide with a lawyers’ “Long March” on March 12-16 . 
The chance for violence and chaos is likely during continued street protests. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Although we do not believe [LOC Pakistan  ] is a failed [LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 00000454 002 OF 004 state , we nonetheless recognize that the challenges the state confronts are dire . 
The government is losing more and more territory every day to foreign and domestic militant groups ; deteriorating law and order in turn is undermining economic recovery . 
The bureaucracy has settled into third-world mediocrity , as demonstrated by corruption and a limited capacity to implement or articulate policy . 
The court and legal system is slow to the point of inertia due to almost non-existent case management . 
These problems extend to law enforcement agencies , where the police are underpaid , lack technical capacity , and face stiff political pressures . 
Security --------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The good news is that the [ORG Army/Frontier Corps  ] are engaged in combat in the [ORG FATA  ] and have just declared victory after a six month long battle in the [ORG Bajaur Agency  ] . 
[PER Zardari  ] is committed to the fight ; he knows that [PER Osama bin Laden  ] has publicly targeted [LOC Pakistan  ] and admits “the militants are after me and my job.” The bad news is that the militants increasingly are setting the agenda . 
The government’s anti-terrorism strategy is based on “dialogue , deterrence and development ; ” however , it lacks the military capacity to deter militants and the financial resources to develop the [ORG FATA  ] and [ORG NWFP  ] . 
Its historic fallback has been to play for time by conducting negotiations with militants , a disastrous tactic that only has made the extremists stronger . 
The government insists it will negotiate with tribal leaders but not with militants. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) However , in the latest agreement in Swat ( once a tourist resort approximately 90 miles from [LOC Islamabad  ] ) , the provincial government agreed to negotiate for peace in exchange for imposition of [ORG Shari’a  ] law with the [MISC Taliban  ] . 
This was recognition of de-facto [MISC Taliban  ] control , which produced beheadings , closure of girls’ schools , a growing exodus of terrified citizens , and the desertion of outgunned and outmanned police . 
Ham-handed military tactics , which included indiscriminate artillery bombardment , have further alienated a population that simply wants the fighting to end . 
In just a few short weeks , the deal is already proving to be an unpalatable one , with the militants demanding more ground and continuing violence against the civilian government. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The military’s decision in 2008 to strike a deal with [MISC Pakistani  ] [MISC Taliban  ] leader [PER Baitullah Mehsud  ] in [MISC South Waziristan  ] helped to reduce the number of suicide bombings in [LOC Pakistan  ] but gave [PER Mehsud  ] free rein to infiltrate his forces throughout the [LOC Federally Administered Tribal Areas  ] ( [ORG FATA  ] ) . 
He has exploited sectarian tensions and sent his fighters into [LOC Bajaur  ] via [LOC Afghanistan  ] to attack government positions . 
This has eroded Chief of [ORG Army Staff General  ] Kayani’s strategy to gradually regain control of the [ORG FATA  ] agency by agency . 
Rival [MISC Pakistani  ] [MISC Taliban  ] leaders [PER Mehsud  ] , [PER Maulvi Nazir  ] , and [PER Gul Bahadur  ] have formed a new alliance which they claim will focus on cross-border attacks . 
As recent media reports indicate , the [LOC U.S.  ] has been remarkably successful in disrupting al-Qaida operations in [MISC Pakistan’s  ] tribal areas . 
In the past year , 10 of the top 20 al-Qaida operatives , including those responsible for the [LOC East Africa  ] embassy bombings in 1998 and tied to [MISC Islambad’s  ] Marriott bombing , have been eliminated . 
[ORG Police/Law Enforcement  ] ---------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Although [MISC Pakistani  ] security forces are now engaged in active combat against extremists , they lack the capability to deal with militants and criminal activity in the [ORG FATA  ] and [ORG NWFP  ] . 
The resulting decrease in security is impeding our efforts to implement development projects in support of critical [LOC U.S.  ] national goals of eliminating terrorist safe havens in [LOC Pakistan  ] and stabilizing [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
While there is a need for [MISC Pakistani  ] military action now to deal with the large number of heavily armed militants operating in the border areas , the long-term solution to ensuring law and order throughout the country lies primarily with the civilian law enforcement agencies , not the military . 
To strengthen civilian law enforcement , [ORG State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics  ] and [ORG Law Enforcement  ] ( [ORG INL  ] ) expanded program in 2009 involves two tracks , the first focusing on establishing a gendarmerie style force in [ORG NWFP  ] suited for [LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 00000454 003 OF 004 engaging and defeating heavily armed militants and criminal gangs . 
The second track involves expanding the current [MISC ICITAP  ] , [LOC DS/ATA  ] and other efforts in providing specialist and advanced training to specific elements of the [MISC Pakistani  ] police establishment. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) In conjunction with [MISC INL’s  ] police program , the [ORG Department of State’s Anti-Terrorism Assistance Program  ] ( [ORG ATA  ] ) will focus on providing expanded training and consultation opportunities to the [ORG NWFP  ] , [ORG Balochistan  ] , and federal areas to expand rapidly the [MISC GOP’s  ] antiterrorist capabilities . 
This expanded training will focus on building tactical , technical , and investigative skill sets in specialized [MISC Pakistani  ] law enforcement agencies . 
Training for these and other units will focus on “hard skill” tactical training ( i.e. protecting [MISC VIPs  ] , quick reaction forces , explosives detection/disposal ) most urgently needed by the [MISC GOP  ] given the deteriorating security environment that it confronts . 
There will also be an expanded effort to develop national and provincial-level forensics and investigative capabilities and anti-kidnapping procedures . 
[ORG ATA  ] was instrumental in establishing and funding the [ORG FIA’s Special Investigative Group  ] ( [ORG SIG  ] ) . 
In 2007 , [ORG ATA  ] offered to fund expansion of the [ORG SIG  ] by 100 officers and pay salaries for the new officers ; we still await an official response from [LOC MOI.  ] <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) Through the [MISC Rewards  ] for Justice program , the [ORG USG  ] is ready to assist [LOC Pakistan  ] in establishing a [ORG National Safety Hotline  ] , through which [PER MOI  ] can collect information from [MISC Pakistani  ] citizens on terrorists and planned/executed terrorist incidents in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
The [MISC GOP  ] would serve as the public “front” of the [MISC Rewards  ] program ; all [LOC U.S.  ] funding and cooperation would remain discreet . 
The [MISC GOP  ] would serve asthe conduit for any eventual reward payments , and a DOD MIST team has developed a media campaign in support of the [MISC Rewards  ] program . 
The [MISC GOP  ] will provide daily logistical and administrative support ; [ORG RSO  ] will provide to administrative personnel to assist in collecting the tip information . 
[ORG Visa Processing  ] ---------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) Post-9/11 changes to improve [LOC U.S.  ] border security have dramatically increased the length of time it takes [MISC Pakistani  ] citizens to obtain [LOC U.S.  ] visitor visas . 
The local press and many politicians repeatedly criticize delays in visa processing and difficulties encountered at [LOC U.S.  ] ports of entry , often citing them as examples of [LOC U.S.  ] bias against [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
On a practical level , the delays impair [LOC U.S.  ] efforts to train law enforcement and military personnel , and to promote exchanges and academic programs with civilian authorities . 
While the [ORG USG  ] does not comment on the reasons for the delay , [LOC Pakistan  ] authorities know that an interagency security clearance process , which includes the [ORG FBI  ] , is the main factor . 
You may hear complaints about this issue during your meetings in [LOC Islamabad  ] , as well as calls for more effort on the [LOC U.S.  ] part to improve the process . 
[LOC Mumbai  ] ------ <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) Indo-Pak tensions are still simmering , but to avoid a potential [MISC Indian  ] military strike , the [MISC GOP  ] needs to continue to show progress on prosecuting those [MISC Lashkar-e-Taiba  ] ( LeT ) operatives responsible for the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks . 
On February 12 , the [MISC GOP  ] filed official charges against 13 suspects , including LeT leaders [PER Javed Iqbal Laqvi  ] , [PER Zarrar Shah  ] , and [MISC Abu  ] al-Qama . 
Currently the [ORG Federal Investigative Agency  ] ( [ORG FIA  ] ) has at least 7 of these suspects in custody ; and they face charges under [MISC Pakistan’s  ] penal code , cyber crimes regulations , and the [ORG Anti-Terrorism Act  ] . 
[LOC India  ] has welcomed the [MISC GOP  ] decision to file formal charges against the key masterminds of [LOC Mumbai  ] ; [LOC Islamabad  ] now awaits an [MISC Indian  ] response to requests for additional information ( 32 questions , including request for forensics , ballistics reports , etc ) from [LOC New Delhi  ] to support prosecution . 
Based on the [MISC Indian  ] response , [LOC Pakistan  ] will consider sending an [ORG FIA  ] team to [LOC New Delhi  ] to follow up ; we should encourage that team to go to [LOC New Delhi  ] and continue to press for additional closures of LeT camps and [MISC Jamaat-ud-Dawa  ] “charitable” activities , particularly in [LOC Punjab  ] . 
The issue of [ORG FBI  ] access to the [LOC Mumbai  ] detainees remains a politically sensitive one you will want to raise directly with [ORG MOI Malik  ] . 
[LOC ISLAMABAD  ] 00000454 004 OF 004 Kidnapping Cases ---------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [LOC S  ] ) The [ORG Embassy  ] appreciates ongoing [ORG FBI  ] support to resolve a significant number of kidnapping cases involving Amcits in [LOC Pakistan  ] . 
We will update you on current efforts to secure the release of [ORG UNHCR  ] representative [PER John Solecki  ] and [ORG New York Times  ] reporter [PER David Rohde  ] . 
A video of Mr. [PER Solecki  ] was released on February 13 which was accompanied by a statement demanding the release of [ORG Baloch  ] prisoners in the hands of the government . 
The [ORG Baloch Liberation United Front  ] ( [ORG BLUF  ] - a previously unknown group ) is holding [PER Solecki  ] and made fresh demands on March 1 that all incarcerated women be released within 72 hours or [ORG BLUF  ] will kill [PER Solecki  ] . 
The [MISC GOP  ] continues to insist that [PER Brahamdagh Bugti  ] , a [ORG Baloch  ] separatist leader , is responsible for the kidnapping .
