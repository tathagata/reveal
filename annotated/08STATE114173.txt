End Summary . 
[LOC Georgia  ] ------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [MISC Swedish  ] Political Director [PER Bjorn Lyrvall  ] led off the discussion on [LOC Georgia  ] noting that [LOC Russia  ] had failed to achieve its primary goal there , i.e. regime change . 
He said it is important to maintain pressure on [LOC Russia  ] to abide by the terms of the ceasefire . 
He stressed the need to show support for [LOC Georgia  ] , and to ensure Ministerial-level attendance at the October 22 donor conference . 
Getting observers into the disputed regions is also very important . 
The [ORG EU  ] should work towards rollover to international observers in [LOC South Ossetia  ] and [LOC Abkhazia  ] , adding that [MISC Russian  ] demands for restrictions on [MISC Georgian  ] military and police movement are unacceptable . 
He emphasized that business as usual with [LOC Russia  ] is not possible. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) A/S [PER Fried  ] agreed that regime change was the ultimate goal of the [MISC Russian  ] invasion and that while the [ORG GOR  ] had failed for now , it is unlikely to give up . 
It is therefore important to shore up the [MISC Georgian  ] economy , help stabilize the political system , keep pressure on the GOG to reform and strengthen its democratic institutions , and to strengthen the military so [LOC Georgia  ] can defend itself . 
[LOC Russia  ] and [LOC Georgia  ] must be treated equally at negotiations ; it should be clear that [LOC South Ossetia  ] and [LOC Abkhazia  ] are not on the same footing as [LOC Georgia  ] . 
Should [LOC Russia  ] pull out of uncontested [LOC Georgia  ] , then the acute phase of the crisis will be over . 
It is important to find a way forward that prevents [LOC Russia  ] from shoring up any gains. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [MISC Estonian  ] Political Director Kull noted that there are challenges ahead in maintaining [LOC Georgia  ] 's territorial integrity and in ensuring [ORG EU  ] cooperation . 
The problem is that not all [ORG EU  ] members agree about what needs to be done , especially on visa facilitation . 
[ORG Danish Political  ] Director [PER Damsgaard  ] agreed that there is a need to stress territorial integrity , and that the [ORG EU  ] mandate concerns the whole of [LOC Georgia  ] , including the contested areas. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [MISC Latvian  ] Political Director Usubs was most concerned about the October 15 international talks on security and stability in the [MISC Georgian  ] regions of [LOC Abkhazia  ] and [LOC South Ossetia  ] as provided for in the September 8 Sarkozy-Medvedev agreement . 
He worried that [LOC Russia  ] will pressure CIS countries , especially those with a need for energy , to recognize [LOC South Ossetia  ] and [LOC Abkhazia  ] . 
The engagement of the [ORG EU  ] in monitoring missions lends an element of credibility . 
[LOC Finland  ] 's [PER Vierros  ] agreed that the [ORG EU  ] presence is welcome ; she found it worrisome , however , that monitors are still having trouble accessing [LOC South Ossetia.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) A/S [PER Fried  ] reiterated that the August ceasefire should not be renegotiated - the six point plan calls for [LOC Russia  ] 's withdrawal to the lines of August 7 . 
If [LOC Russia  ] shows it is serious in the October 15 conference , then we can respond seriously . 
If they are non-compliant , then we still have something to talk about . 
However , if [LOC Russia  ] wastes everyone 's time with talk of no fly zones and arms embargoes , then we'll know how to respond to that as well . 
We will not accept arrangements where [LOC South Ossetia  ] , [LOC Abkhazia  ] , and [LOC Georgia  ] are treated as equals - they are not . 
[LOC Russia  ] may be testing the limits of the international community to see whether it can turn the meetings into a circus . 
On the other hand , [LOC Russia  ] itself may not know what it wants. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [LOC Denmark  ] 's [PER Damsgaard  ] opined that the issue of [ORG MAP  ] probably will not be solved in December for either [LOC Georgia  ] or [LOC Ukraine  ] and that there is a need to think constructively about how to get around that problem . 
[MISC Estonian  ] Political Director Kull was also concerned about [LOC Georgia  ] 's prospects for [ORG MAP  ] in December , as some countries that had previously been supportive are now hesitant . 
A/S [PER Fried  ] said that [ORG MAP  ] is the right thing to do and that the [LOC U.S.  ] is supportive . 
[MISC Norwegian  ] [PER PolDir Ellefsen  ] mentioned that there will probably be no agreement in December and that the allies will need to be creative , not confrontational . 
It is also important that [LOC Russia  ] understand that its actions have instilled fear in its neighbors . 
[LOC Belarus  ] -------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [MISC E-PINE  ] participants largely concurred that notwithstanding some positive developments in [LOC Belarus  ] , the recent elections were disappointing . 
A/S [PER Fried  ] noted the [ORG USG  ] had responded quickly to the release of political prisoners by temporarily lifting the sanctions on some companies and sending [PER DAS Merkel  ] to [LOC Minsk  ] . 
[PER Pavilionis  ] thought that isolating the regime too much would be a strategic mistake ; most other e-PINE countries supported limited engagement with civil society groups , the opposition , and mid-level officials as a means to break [MISC Belarusian  ] isolation . 
All thought that it was important to offer [LOC Belarus  ] alternatives to dependence on [LOC Russia  ] , but were hesitant to do much more for fear of rewarding bad behavior . 
[LOC Ukraine  ] -------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) The [LOC Ukraine  ] discussion focused on continued domestic political turmoil , the need for reform , and the potential for instability in [LOC Crimea  ] . 
[PER Damsgaard  ] noted that [LOC Ukraine  ] needs to realize there is more to democracy than holding free and fair elections , adding that the [ORG GOU  ] 's constant internal power struggles undermined effective governance . 
Turning to the issue of [ORG NATO  ] membership , A/S [PER Fried  ] pointed out that although [LOC Ukraine  ] is ambivalent about being issued a [ORG MAP  ] , its increasing engagement with the [ORG EU  ] is a good thing . 
He expressed concern about possible [MISC Russian  ] subversion in [LOC Crimea  ] , adding that there is a need for more social programs and investment there and the [MISC Russians  ] should not be allowed to operate freely . 
[PER Lyrvall  ] suggested that although getting observers into [LOC Crimea  ] would be very difficult , it would not be a bad idea to set up [ORG EU  ] information offices to get visitors into the area . 
[PER Pavilionis  ] continued to urge [ORG MAP  ] for [LOC Ukraine  ] , fearing that talk of compromise at this stage would leave ministers nothing to discuss in December . 
[LOC Moldova  ] -------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [PER Vierros  ] began the discussion on [LOC Moldova  ] , saying that the [ORG OSCE  ] 's overall objective at present is formal 5 2 negotiations . 
[LOC Romania  ] would like to be integrated into the format , but its participation should be channeled through the [ORG EU  ] . 
[MISC Russian  ] influence in [LOC Transnistria  ] is increasing and they are trying to re-launch their 2003 federation plan . 
A/S [PER Fried  ] said that [LOC Moldova  ] should not feel compelled to adopt a plan that is bad for the country , reiterating [ORG USG  ] support for the 5 2 talks . 
The [MISC Moldovan  ] constitution ensures neutrality and the [ORG USG  ] is not needed as a guarantor of that . 
If that is what [LOC Moldova  ] wants , then it is their choice ; neutrality is no hindrance to bilateral cooperation . 
[PER Lyrvall  ] noted that the [ORG EU  ] needs to make [LOC Moldova  ] an attractive option for [LOC Transnistria  ] and that the [ORG EU  ] can be helpful in that regard through an enhanced agreement and confidence-building measures . 
[PER Pavilionis  ] thought that [LOC Moldova  ] is a partial success and that now is the time for the [ORG EU  ] to get serious and complete its mandate , to prolong [ORG EUBAM  ] and develop its role . 
The [ORG EU  ] also needs to be ready to develop a civilian mission there . 
[LOC Iraq  ] ---- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [LOC Estonia  ] 's Kull led off the [LOC Iraq  ] discussion , noting that the on-going conflict is a challenge to trans-Atlantic relations , counter-terrorism efforts , and [MISC Muslim-Christian  ] relations . 
He was pleased the GOI is more able to control the security situation now , but questioned how it will do when the number of foreign troops decreases . 
The [MISC Maliki  ] government 's pressure to limit foreign troops is creating problems reaching agreement on the [ORG SOFA  ] and he expressed hope that this will be resolved by the end of the year . 
A/S [PER Fried  ] thanked the e-PINE countries for their various contributions . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] ----------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Ellefsen  ] led the discussion , noting the increasing pessimism in [LOC Kabul  ] , which he said pointed to the need for stronger government institutions and more coordination . 
A/S [PER Fried  ] said that there are a number of problems that must be tackled including better civil-military coordination and the need for a stronger coalition . 
He emphasized the need to support the [MISC Afghan  ] military as it expands and that the [ORG USG  ] has asked most of the e-PINE countries to contribute to that effort . 
We appreciate the efforts of contributors and know that there are many challenges ahead . 
[LOC Lithuania  ] agreed with A/S [PER Fried  ] 's assessment of the situation and thanked the [LOC U.S.  ] for its assistance with their PRT in [LOC Ghor Province  ] and the [MISC Swedes  ] for their assistance on the [LOC Herat  ] road feasibility study .
