( C/NOFORN ) [PER SUMMARY: XXXXXXXXXXXXl  ] told us January 12 that Judge Bruguiere 's November 17 report recommending the prosecution of President [PER Kagame  ] and requesting the arrest of nine of his associates had been forwarded to [ORG Interpol  ] . 
He noted that it was incumbent on the [LOC U.S.  ] to make its own determination as to whether the [LOC U.S.  ] was subject to any legal obligations as a result . 
[LOC Belgium  ] and the [LOC UK  ] have informed [LOC France  ] that they will honor the arrest warrants if any of the nine arrive in their territories and will do so pursuant to an [ORG EU  ] agreement covering such matters . 
The same official said that former-President [PER Habyarimana  ] 's widow , who had recently lost a [MISC French  ] court case on her request for political asylum , planned to appeal . 
The case was thus not yet closed , and [LOC Rwanda  ] had not , contrary to media reports , " officially " requested her arrest in connection with the 1994 genocide . 
Separately , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] conceded that the [ORG GOF  ] had given [PER Bruguiere  ] the green light to issue his report , in response to [LOC Rwanda  ] 's continuing probes into , and allegations concerning , [LOC France  ] 's role in the events of 1994 in [LOC Rwanda  ] ; the same source surmised that the [ORG GOF  ] had miscalculated and had not envisioned the severe measures [LOC Rwanda  ] would take in response END SUMMARY . 
ARREST WARRANTS <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) MFA [LOC Rwanda  ] desk officer [PER Laurent Chevallier  ] said on January 12 that Judge Bruguiere 's November 17 report on events in 1994 concerning the death of then-Rwandan President [PER Habyarimana  ] and recommending the prosecution of President [PER Kagame  ] and calling for the arrest of nine of his associates , had been forwarded to [ORG Interpol  ] . 
( We contacted [PER Chevallier  ] in response to ref A e-mails asking whether [ORG Bruguiere  ] 's report created any legal obligations for the [LOC U.S.  ] should the individuals named seek to enter the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) [PER Chevallier  ] said that he was not in a position to make determinations on [LOC U.S.  ] legal obligations . 
The matter had been forwarded to [ORG Interpol  ] , he repeated , but he was not certain how [ORG Interpol  ] had proceeded . 
[PER Chevallier  ] was confident , however , that [ORG Bruguiere  ] 's report had the same effect as the issuance of international arrest warrants . 
He said that [LOC Belgium  ] and the [LOC UK  ] had already told the [MISC French  ] that they would arrest those named should they enter their territories , based on [ORG Bruguiere  ] 's warrants . 
However , they would act not because of obligations regarding [ORG Interpol  ] but rather in accordance with an [ORG EU  ] agreement covering arrest warrants issued by member states. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Chevallier  ] advised that the USG was the only entity that could determine whether the circumstances of this case and its relationship with [ORG Interpol  ] placed any obligation on the [LOC U.S.  ] concerning these individuals . 
" I 'm sure you understand that as a [MISC French  ] official , I really can't tell your government how this all affects you , " he continued . 
He suggested that officials in [LOC Washington  ] study the matter and , if necessary , work with [ORG Interpol  ] to determine what , if any , obligations [LOC Washington  ] might incur . 
MRS. HABYARIMANA <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Chevallier  ] commented briefly on the case of the widow of former [MISC Rwandan  ] President [PER Habyarimana  ] . 
The press announced during the week of January 8 that a [MISC French  ] court had refused her request to remain in [LOC France  ] as a political exile , and also reported that [LOC Rwanda  ] had insisted that she be arrested for her alleged role in the 1994 genocide . 
[PER Chevallier  ] referred to the January 11 MFA press briefing , during which the spokesperson noted developments in her case and denied that [LOC Rwanda  ] had " officially " requested her arrest . 
[PER Chevallier  ] said that Mrs. [PER Habyarimana  ] 's case was not closed , and that in fact she had already indicated an intention to appeal " before the end of January . 
" [PER Chevallier  ] reiterated that , to his knowledge , [LOC Rwanda  ] had not " officially " requested her arrest . 
He remarked dryly that it would be interesting if [LOC Rwanda  ] did so , since it had " officially " severed diplomatic relations with [LOC France  ] in response to the [ORG Bruguiere  ] report . 
( C/NOFORN ) [ORG GOF  ] GAVE GREEN LIGHT TO BRUGUIERE , ACCORDING TO MFA DAS <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C/NOFORN ) In a recent conversation largely on other matters , [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] confided that the [ORG GOF  ] had given [ORG Bruguiere  ] the green light to issue his report . 
( NOTE: The party and public line [LOC PARIS  ] 00000186 002 OF 002 has been that [ORG Bruguiere  ] , exercising his judicial independence , had done so without consulting other [ORG GOF  ] elements . 
END NOTE . 
) [PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that [LOC France  ] had wanted to reciprocate for [LOC Rwanda  ] 's taking steps to investigate [LOC France  ] 's alleged involvement in the 1994 genocide and its aftermath . 
[PER XXXXXXXXXXXX  ] said that the [ORG GOF  ] had miscalculated , not foreseeing the strong measures ( i.e. , severing diplomatic relations ) [LOC Rwanda  ] would take in retaliation .
