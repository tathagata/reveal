Stapleton  ] , for reasons 1.5 ( b ) and ( d ) SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) That the first international follow-on to [LOC Annapolis  ] is taking place in [LOC Paris  ] reflects the new confidence and greater cooperation that characterize our relationship with [LOC France  ] seven months into the Presidency of [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] . 
[LOC France  ] 's support for our efforts to achieve peace in the [LOC Middle East  ] contrasts sharply with its previous preferred role as a side-line critic . 
It is just one example of the broader re-positioning of [LOC France  ] vis-a-vis the [LOC U.S.  ] which we have been quick to recognize and take advantage of . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] 's desire to maximize [LOC France  ] 's influence by working with the [LOC U.S.  ] to address common challenges is the international component of a larger ambition for his five-year Presidency: to renew [LOC France  ] though deep reform at home and resumption of its leadership in [LOC Europe  ] . 
With an exceptionally long political honeymoon behind him , [PER Sarkozy  ] is now pressing ahead with his domestic reform agenda . 
He has met with predictable opposition ( most dramatically in the form of transport strikes ) , and some questioning among political allies of his strategy of undertaking sequential , calibrated reform rather than a Thatcherite big bang at the outset of his term . 
Despite the difficulty of the challenge , including an unsettled international economic context , and little budgetary room for maneuver , [PER Sarkozy  ] remains determined to see his program through . 
Given his dominant political position , that remains a realistic prospect . 
An activist on the international scene , with an opportunistic eye for grabbing attention and credit , [PER Sarkozy  ] will remain a challenging partner despite his desire to improve the bilateral relationship . 
He has concentrated responsibility for foreign affairs in the Presidency to an unprecedented degree , while Foreign Minister [PER Kouchner  ] has focused on selected policy issues . 
This message also addresses the specifics of [LOC France  ] 's [LOC Middle East  ] policies . 
While under [PER Sarkozy  ] the [MISC French  ] are more supportive , our collaboration ( and intra-GOF coordination ) on [LOC Lebanon  ] has of late not been as close as it should be , as [PER Sarkozy  ] 's team in the [LOC Elysee  ] has focused single-mindedly on electing a President while squeezing the democratically-elected majority and weakening its ability to deal with post-election challenges . 
End Summary THE RELATIONSHIP ---------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Madame Secretary , The seven months since [PER Nicolas Sarkozy  ] became President of [LOC France  ] -- and the six months since your last visit -- has been a remarkable period in three respects . 
First , our relationship with [LOC France  ] has undergone a significant qualitative change . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has set in place a new paradigm for [MISC French  ] foreign policy , one more favorable to our interests . 
Scrapping [ORG Chirac  ] 's worldview , which equated [MISC French  ] leadership with containing [LOC U.S.  ] hegemony , [PER Sarkozy  ] has articulated the need for [LOC France  ] to work closely with the [LOC U.S.  ] -- in order to address common challenges , but also as the surest way to increase [LOC France  ] 's global influence . 
[LOC France  ] 's increased involvement in and commitment to [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the beginning of a [MISC French  ] interest in [LOC Iraq  ] , and [LOC France  ] 's consideration of a full return to [ORG NATO  ] , are the most symbolically powerful examples of [LOC France  ] 's policy reorientation . 
Second , we have ratcheted up our cooperation with [LOC France  ] across our foreign policy agenda , particularly on [LOC Middle East  ] issues , but also on [LOC Kosovo  ] , [LOC Burma  ] , [ORG Sudan/Darfur  ] and elsewhere . 
In [LOC Lebanon  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] 's more activist foreign policy has already put the new cooperative relationship to the test . 
Third , over the past seven months , [PER Sarkozy  ] has begun to implement the ambitious platform of domestic reform he had promised as a candidate . 
[PER SARKOZY  ] ------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Before addressing the [LOC Middle East  ] issues that will be the focus of your visit here , a word on the domestic context . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] enjoyed an exceptionally long political honeymoon , one which extended well into the Fall . 
His election -- representing the victory of a new-generation leader , one with unmatched communication skills and a detailed and ambitious program for renewing [LOC France  ] -- led to a season of national elan and optimism . 
The return to normal [LOC PARIS  ] 00004685 002.2 OF 004 in the political life of the country over the past two months was predictable , as [PER Sarkozy  ] 's efforts to implement difficult domestic changes have run into opposition from those -- such as rail workers -- who stand to lose , and many others who fear change of any kind . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] has disappointed some in his own camp for not immediately embarking on radical , deep-rooted , pervasive reform , taking advantage of his electoral mandate . 
Instead , [PER Sarkozy  ] has decided to carefully pick his battles , gaining momentum from each piecemeal victory . 
All in all , [PER Sarkozy  ] remains in a politically powerful position , operating as the hands-on leader of a largely unchecked executive branch , unencumbered for now by a political opposition worthy of the name . 
He is determined to make his mark during his five year term ( which he insists may be his single term of office ) , but has demonstrated greater caution than might have been expected , mindful of the international economic and financial environment , and severe budgetary constraints at home . 
[PER KOUCHNER  ] -------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Sarkozy  ] 's foreign minister , [PER Bernard Kouchner  ] , was the prize catch in [PER Sarkozy  ] 's opportunistic effort to appoint figures of the center and center-left to his government , thereby increasing its legitimacy and political heft ( and depleting that of the opposition ) as he waged the domestic reform battle . 
While rumors circulate of a cabinet re-shuffle early in the new year or following municipal elections in March , [PER Kouchner  ] 's position appears secure for now . 
( Defense Minister [PER Morin  ] and Interior Minister [PER Alliot-Marie  ] are among those thought most imperiled . 
) He enjoys a personal chemistry with the President based on [PER Sarkozy  ] 's long-time admiration of [PER Kouchner  ] 's personal and political courage and humanitarian accomplishments . 
[PER Kouchner  ] remains very popular -- consistently scoring at or near the top of the polls measuring the popularity of [LOC France  ] 's political leaders . 
But even his star quality ( that he alone in the government can claim ) has not kept him from being eclipsed by his hyper-active and media-savvy president . 
Surely more of a concern to [PER Kouchner  ] , [PER Sarkozy  ] has concentrated foreign policy decision-making and implementation to an unprecedented degree in the [LOC Elysee  ] , with Secretary-General [PER Claude Gueant  ] and [ORG Diplomatic Advisor SIPDIS  ] [PER Jean-David Levitte  ] accruing as much if not more influence than [PER Kouchner  ] . 
[PER Kouchner  ] has largely focused on the issues with which he has the greatest experience and level of comfort -- [LOC Lebanon  ] , [LOC Kosovo  ] , and [LOC Darfur  ] among them . 
While he has of late curbed his penchant for off-the-cuff , undiplomatic public comments , the thin-skinned [PER Kouchner  ] has shown irritation over the involvement of [ORG Elysee  ] officials in the delicate negotiations over [LOC Lebanon  ] 's presidential elections , and he may be uncomfortable with [PER Sarkozy  ] 's increasing willingness to downgrade human rights considerations in his dealings foreign leaders , as demonstrated by the way he has kept his distance from the ongoing five-day visit to [LOC Paris  ] of [PER Mu'ammar Qadhafi  ] . 
[LOC Middle East  ] ----------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) Under [PER Sarkozy  ] , [LOC France  ] 's [LOC Middle East  ] policies have become more supportive of and congruent with [LOC U.S.  ] interests , but we are concerned that in the past few weeks our collaboration ( and intra-GOF coordination ) on [LOC Lebanon  ] has not been what it should be , as [PER Sarkozy  ] 's Presidency team has focused single-mindedly on electing a President in such a way that squeezes the democratically-elected majority and weakens its ability to deal with post-election challenges. --Arab/Israeli peace: The [MISC French  ] remain major supporters of our efforts focused on supporting the [MISC Israeli/Palestinian  ] negotiations . 
Their eagerness to make [LOC Annapolis  ] a success and to host the [LOC Paris  ] conference on assistance to the [MISC Palestinians  ] underscored this . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Kouchner  ] both want [LOC France  ] to be a key player in what they hope will be a strong and successful push in 2008 to the creation of a [MISC Palestinian  ] state . 
In many ways , [LOC France  ] aspires to be a favored additional partner to the Quartet . 
[MISC Syrian  ] participation at [LOC Annapolis  ] has also sparked hopeful commentary in the [MISC French  ] media that a larger dynamic -- in which [LOC France  ] can participate -- is underway that inter alia would foster an unraveling of the [MISC Syrian/Iranian  ] relationship and halt [MISC Iranian  ] inroads through support of [ORG Hizballah  ] in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Kouchner  ] will listen attentively to any [LOC PARIS  ] 00004685 003.2 OF 004 vision you may outline of how you expect the negotiations to unfold and whether there is a reasonable expectation of them broadening to include [LOC Syria.  ] --Lebanon: Even as the [MISC French  ] have become a positive force behind our efforts on behalf of [MISC Arab-Israeli  ] peace , the close collaboration with the [ORG GOF  ] under former President [PER Chirac  ] , with his single-minded focus on supporting [PER Saad Hariri  ] and isolating [LOC Syria  ] , has suffered . 
This is partly due to the extremely fluid situation in [LOC Lebanon  ] . 
But it also results from the tug of war between [PER Kouchner  ] and the [ORG Elysee  ] over who is in charge of the issue , one that developed after it became clear the deadline for electing a new president would pass without a new candidate chosen . 
There is abundant evidence that the [MISC Syrians  ] , possibly with help from the [ORG Amir  ] of [LOC Qatar  ] ( a friend of [PER Sarkozy  ] and President [PER Bashar al-Asad  ] ) , lured the [ORG Elysee  ] into leading a process with far different objectives than the one [PER Kouchner  ] began last summer . 
Whereas [PER Kouchner  ] was focused on helping the [MISC Lebanese  ] get out of their political deadlock , [PER Levitte  ] and the [ORG Elysee  ] have sought a resolution of the presidential crisis that would satisfy larger geopolitical aims involving [LOC Syria  ] . 
It is also clear to us that the [ORG Elysee  ] , given [PER Sarkozy  ] , s obsession with achieving results , is focused on electing a president so that it can be considered another [MISC French  ] diplomatic triumph . 
The unfortunate net result continues to be the impression that [MISC French  ] pressure for a deal falls exclusively on the March 14 majority and not where it belongs -- on the March 8 opposition that is acting in close coordination with [LOC Syria  ] intent on wringing key concessions from the democratically elected majority . 
Even if the presidential crisis is resolved by December 17 , we would recommend that you discuss with [PER Kouchner  ] and [PER Sarkozy  ] how we can more effectively work together as we address the multitude of difficult challenges facing [LOC Lebanon  ] , of which the Presidential election is only the first. --Iran: The public release of the recent [MISC NIE  ] on [MISC Iranian  ] nuclear capabilities was a shock to all but the highest levels of the [ORG GOF  ] , which was briefed on its conclusions . 
Although the [MISC French  ] have publicly backed our view that [LOC Iran  ] continues to pose a serious threat and further international sanctions are warranted ( a line echoed in most of the [MISC French  ] press ) , the [ORG GOF  ] anticipates a major " communication problem " with its [ORG EU  ] partners , the [MISC Iranians  ] , [LOC China  ] , and [LOC Russia  ] . 
There is further the delicate diplomacy [LOC France  ] is undertaking with different elements in the [MISC Iranian  ] regime in order to maintain a viable channel that bypasses President [PER Ahmadinejad  ] ( who appeared to complain about this in a recent letter to [PER Sarkozy  ] ) . 
In geostrategic terms , the [MISC French  ] see [LOC Iran  ] as the primary threat to the [LOC Middle East  ] and worry about inroads it has made in [LOC Lebanon  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] . 
As noted above , there is also some thinking , at least among analysts outside the [ORG GOF  ] , that [LOC Annapolis  ] and the [MISC NIE  ] betoken a significant shift of [LOC U.S.  ] strategy in the [ORG Bush Administration  ] 's last year that involves new [LOC U.S.  ] thinking about [LOC Iran  ] . 
[PER Sarkozy  ] and [PER Kouchner  ] would welcome anything you could share with respect to how we regard [LOC Iran  ] in a post-Annapolis [LOC Middle East.  ] --Iraq: [MISC French  ] follow-up to [PER Kouchner  ] 's visit to [LOC Baghdad  ] last August and [MISC Iraqi  ] President [PER Talabani  ] 's subsequent visit to [LOC Paris  ] has been slow . 
Concern about the security situation , despite what the [MISC French  ] acknowledge to be marginal improvements in some areas of [LOC Iraq  ] , lack of coordination at the working level among [MISC French  ] ministries , and the failure so far to achieve a breakthrough on national reconciliation have slowed or prevented follow-on [MISC French  ] engagement . 
[PER Kouchner  ] , however , did ask [PER SecDef Gates  ] for a list of specific areas in which we thought [LOC France  ] could be helpful . 
We should use that opening to engage the [MISC French  ] in a more active dialogue between representatives of our respective interagencies . 
We recommend that you use the opportunity to inquire about [PER Kouchner  ] 's current thinking about [MISC French  ] assistance to [LOC Iraq  ] and let him know we would like to send an interagency team to [LOC Paris  ] early in the [MISC New Year  ] to begin these discussions . 
We would further recommend that you ask [PER Kouchner  ] about his efforts to rally [ORG EU  ] support for and to promote meaningful engagement with the [MISC Iraqi  ] government . 
You might also praise his personal commitment to [LOC Iraq  ] 's success , as demonstrated in part by his participation in the recent [LOC Istanbul  ] summit . 
We understand [PER Kouchner  ] may next visit [LOC Iraq  ] in February when [LOC France  ] is expected to open an embassy office in [LOC Irbil  ] .
