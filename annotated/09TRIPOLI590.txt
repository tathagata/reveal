REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Summary . 
Personalities and relationships play an extremely important role in [LOC Libya  ] 's opaque system of government . 
Your visit will bring you face-to-face with the ambiguity of the [MISC Libyan  ] bureaucracy and will enable you to initiate relationships with the [ORG GOL  ] 's key decision-makers: [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] , FM [PER Musa Kusa  ] , PM al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi , and the sons who are rivaling to carry their father 's mantle -- [PER Muatassim  ] and [PER Saif  ] al-Islam . 
While [PER Musa  ] has taken a larger foreign policy role , he still appears to hold sway on certain intelligence and security issues . 
Whereas [PER Musa  ] has served as a proponent of an expanding [MISC US-Libya  ] relationship , the PM has been more reluctant and has reportedly slow-rolled fulfillment of [ORG GOL  ] WMD commitments . 
As [ORG National Security Advisor  ] , [PER Muatassim  ] 's role has been to herald the call for security assurances as [LOC Libya  ] 's compensation for giving up its WMD program . 
While [PER Saif  ] has ostensibly retreated to the shadows , his influence seems to be continually present in business and social realms . 
In spite of the different personalities vying for influence in [LOC Libya  ] , pleasing the Leader is still the end goal . 
End summary . 
[PER MUAMMAR AL-QADHAFI:  ] SELF-STYLED LEADER OF AFRICA 2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Qadhafi  ] is a famously mercurial interlocutor: his comportment ranges from quiet and difficult to engage ( sometimes avoiding eye contact ) to holding forth in rambling , non-linear fashion . 
His latest interactions with the [LOC West  ] , including during his most recent visit to [LOC Rome  ] , reflect his desire to have his ego fed . 
He has capitalized on his [ORG AU  ] chairmanship by participating in nearly every international meeting to which he has been invited over the last six months , including the [ORG Arab League Summit  ] and the [ORG G8 Summit  ] in [LOC L'Aquila  ] . 
Local press reports indicate that [PER Qadhafi  ] was honored by his handshake with [ORG POTUS  ] at [LOC L'Aquila  ] and his subsequent meeting with [LOC UK  ] PM [PER Gordon Brown  ] . 
Nevertheless , he has reflected his insecurity about national security by seeking military , security and procurement agreements with the likes of [LOC Russia  ] , [LOC France  ] , and [LOC Italy  ] . 
He will want to hear from you the new administration 's views on the bilateral relationship , particularly assurances on peaceful [ORG USG  ] motives in [LOC Libya  ] . 
3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Qadhafi  ] views himself as a man of particular historical importance and has long sought to leverage leadership of [LOC Libya  ] into a more prominent international role . 
His role as [ORG African Union Chair  ] has provided both a convenient forum to raise his international profile and to promote his long-standing policy goals for the continent . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] 's interest in [LOC Africa  ] dates to the late-1980 's , when it became clear that efforts to position [LOC Libya  ] as a leading [MISC Arab  ] state were unlikely to succeed . 
[LOC Libya  ] has significant commercial investments and development projects in [LOC sub-Saharan Africa  ] , and has leveraged them as part of its " dinar diplomacy " approach to managing relations on the continent . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] is keenly focused on [MISC African  ] issues and seems to genuinely aspire to be the founding father of a [LOC United States  ] of [LOC Africa  ] . 
He has expressed willingness to assist [LOC U.S.  ] efforts in [LOC Darfur  ] , [LOC Somalia  ] , and in ending the [MISC Chad-Sudan  ] conflict . 
4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Qadhafi  ] 's increased international profile as [ORG AU Chair  ] coincides with the 40th anniversary of the [MISC Fatah Revolution  ] ( September 1 ) and the tenth anniversary of the [ORG Sirte Declaration  ] that created the [ORG AU  ] ( September 9 ) . 
[LOC Libya  ] 's current roles on the [ORG UNSC  ] and as [ORG UNGA  ] President add to the importance of this year for [ORG Qadhafi  ] . 
[MISC Libyan  ] officials will be looking toward [ORG Qadhafi  ] 's appearance at [ORG UNGA  ] as the capstone of an extraordinary year ; any potential interaction with [ORG POTUS  ] will have long-lasting implications for our bilateral relationship . 
[PER MUSA  ] KUSA'S EXPANDING PORTFOLIO 5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Musa Kusa  ] was named Foreign Minister in March , and was dual-hatted as [ORG External Security Organization  ] ( [ORG ESO  ] ) chief for several weeks before a new [ORG External Security Organization  ] Director was named . 
( Note: The extent to which [PER Kusa  ] has relinquished control of day-to-day intelligence operations remains unclear . 
The current [ORG ESO  ] Director , [PER Abuzeid Dorda  ] , is a former Prime Minister and most recently served as the Chairman of the high-profile Housing and [ORG Infrastructure Board  ] ; however , he does not have experience in intelligence and security issues . 
End note . 
) [PER Kusa  ] frequently travels with the Leader and is a TRIPOLI 00000590 002.2 OF 003 principal advisor on security matters . 
He is [MISC Western-educated  ] , holding an M.A. from [ORG Michigan State  ] , and is seen as a strong supporter of reengagement with the [LOC West  ] . 
The Ambassador and [ORG GRPO  ] have met him frequently . 
He has played a prominent role in [LOC U.S.-Libya  ] relations and , more broadly , in [LOC Libya  ] 's foreign affairs . 
Since becoming Foreign Minister , he has assumed several portfolios previously held by other prominent regime figures . 
6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Kusa  ] is a key mentor for [PER Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi and served as his " minder " during the latter 's first trip to the [LOC U.S.  ] in September 2007 to attend the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] . 
[PER Muatassim  ] made his latest trip without [PER Kusa  ] , but the two likely consult extensively on matters of security and intelligence . 
[PER Kusa  ] previously served ( circa 2004-2006 ) as a mentor to [PER Muatassim  ] 's brother and potential succession rival , [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , and reportedly remains close to him . 
[PER Kusa  ] is rare among [MISC Libyan  ] officials -- he embodies a combination of intellectual acumen , operational ability , and political weight . 
When the [ORG USG  ] has promoted specific areas of cooperation with [PER Kusa  ] , he has been willing to cast the [ORG USG  ] message in terms palatable to [LOC Libya  ] 's leadership . 
AL-BAGHDADI AL-MAHMOUDI: THE [ORG SKEPTIC  ] 7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Prime Minister Dr. al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi has been described as having limited influence with [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] , though he is a key decision-maker within the regime . 
We have had limited contact with al-Mahmoudi . 
[ORG GOL  ] sources have told us that he is seen as an obstacle to deepening bilateral engagement and have hinted that he is personally responsible for holding up the [ORG GOL  ] 's signing of the [MISC HEU-LEU  ] agreement. xxxxxxxxxxxx Al-Mahmoudi also is a key player in resolving the standoff between the [ORG Land Registery Office and Ministry of Finance  ] regarding payment for our seven [ORG USG  ] properties in [LOC Tripoli  ] . 
[ORG MUATASSIM AL-QADHAFI'S ROLE AND INTERESTS  ] 8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Muatassim  ] 's visit to [LOC Washington  ] was seen here as further evidence that he is being groomed as a potential successor to his father 's throne . 
His meeting in March with AFRICOM Commander [PER Ward  ] reflected skepticism about the role of the [ORG Africa Command  ] and a desire for security assurances . 
The points he raised with [PER Ward  ] are likely to preview the issues he will raise with you: 1 ) [LOC Libya  ] has not been adequately compensated for its decision to give up its WMD programs and abandon terrorism in 2003 ; 2 ) [LOC Libya  ] wants security assurances in the form of a defensive alliance with the [LOC United States  ] ; and 3 ) [LOC Libya  ] needs [LOC U.S.  ] training and equipment to adequately secure its borders and fight transnational terrorism . 
[PER Muatassim  ] also stressed to [PER Ward  ] that [LOC Libya  ] is eager to procure lethal and non-lethal military equipment and to resolve the case of [LOC Libya  ] 's eight [MISC C-130  ] 's in [LOC Marietta  ] , [LOC Georgia  ] . 
The [ORG GOL  ] recently sent two amendments to the military-to-military [ORG MOU  ] , requesting security guarantees and rehabilitation and return of [LOC Libya  ] 's eight [MISC C-130  ] 's . 
9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) When [PER Muatassim  ] raised the issue of [LOC Libya  ] 's [MISC C-130  ] 's with the Political-Military ( PM ) Bureau , PM responded that while the [LOC U.S.  ] would look favorably on requests for new aircraft ( C-130J 's ) , the [ORG USG  ] position remains that there will be no compensation for the old aircraft , and [LOC Libya  ] should work directly with [ORG Lockheed Martin  ] to resolve the matter . 
Regarding [LOC Libya  ] 's requests for lethal and non-lethal equipment , [ORG Post  ] has submitted a draft end-use and transfer agreement to the MFA to enable some of the sales , but the [MISC Libyans  ] have not responded with an acceptance of the agreement . 
10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) During his visit to [LOC Washington  ] , [ORG USG  ] interlocuturs urged [PER Muatassim  ] to initiate a [ORG Political-Military Dialogue  ] and marked it as the appropriate venue to develop plans for political-military cooperation . 
[PER Muatassim  ] will be listening for a reaffirmation of our willingness to move forward on the military component of the bilateral relationship , to include security assistance . 
[ORG Post  ] continues to urge the [ORG GOL  ] to discuss outstanding security concerns within the framework of a [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000590 003.2 OF 003 [ORG Political-Military Dialogue  ] . 
[ORG SAIF AL-ISLAM AL-QADHAFI  ] -- MOVING BEHIND THE SCENES 11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Whereas [ORG Saif  ] al-Islam ostensibly retreated from political life nearly one year ago , his influence remains palpable within the country . 
[ORG Saif  ] stands behind the [ORG Economic  ] and [ORG Social Development Fund  ] ( [ORG ESDF  ] ) , which holds one of the most extensive investment portfolios in the country . 
His oil company [LOC NESSO  ] is a member of one of the few successful oil production consortiums in the country , and he is the primary investor in [LOC Libya  ] 's [LOC Coca-Cola  ] operation , among other ventures . 
[ORG Saif  ] also plays a lead role in [LOC Libya  ] 's quasi-civil society . 
His [ORG Qadhafi Foundation  ] oversees the [ORG International Society for Peace and Relief  ] ( which focuses on refugee assistance ) and a new organization entitled the [ORG Arab Alliance for Democracy , Human Rights  ] , and Development ( which he launched at in February at the [ORG Davos Forum  ] to " name and shame " regional human rights abusers ) . 
Our contacts report that [ORG Saif  ] continues to play an influential role with his father and within the regime . 
Some observers view him as retreating strategically from the limelight , after having overstepped boundaries with his expansive reform agenda . 
Nevertheless , he has played an enduring role behind the political scene by brokering dialogue in late-2008 on the release of former [ORG LIFG  ] fighters and facilitating our access to [PER Fathi  ] el-Jahmi in prison ( refs a , b ) . 
We believe that [PER Saif  ] and the [ORG Qadhafi Foundation  ] could be helpful in pushing the [ORG Human Rights Dialogue  ] forward and in creating the buy-in necessary for the regime to actively engage in areas that are of priority concern to us , including rule of law ; the detention and treatment of minorities and refugees ; human trafficking ; and religious freedom . 
12 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Comment: We have requested meetings for you with all of the personalities outlined above . 
Because the roles that [LOC Musa  ] , [PER Muatassim  ] , and [ORG Saif  ] play are fluid and influential with [MISC Qadhafi  ] in different ways , you will have the opportunity to lay out [ORG USG  ] policy priorities as outlined in septel with each of them . 
A clear , unified message that explicitly links achievement of our goals to engagement on their priorities will speak most effectively to the [ORG Qadhafi  ] regime . 
End comment .
