( C ) [ORG TNK-BP  ] Vice President for [ORG International Affairs Shawn McCormick  ] told us late July 24 that CEO [PER Bob Dudley  ] left [LOC Moscow  ] that evening after he learned , through his own and [PER McCormick  ] 's [ORG FSB  ] sources , that his pending visa renewal would be denied on July 25 . 
[PER McCormick  ] told us the morning of July 25 that [ORG AAR  ] is probably celebrating [PER Dudley  ] 's departure . 
[PER McCormick  ] said [ORG AAR  ] would likely now begin trying to strip [ORG TNK-BP  ] of small assets as it tests its powers with [PER Dudley  ] out of the country . 
In a separate meeting , the head of [ORG BP Russia  ] 's shareholder team , [PER Alistair Graham  ] , told us July 25 that [ORG BP  ] was confident that the original shareholder agreement ( from when [ORG TNK-BP  ] was formed ) would protect BPs assets while this dispute plays out . 
" We can wait , " he said . 
He and [PER McCormick  ] both said [ORG AAR  ] was starting to realize that it needed foreigner experts to run the company and was having trouble finding any . 
[PER Graham  ] said [ORG BP  ] believes the [ORG GOR  ] is using [ORG AAR  ] to &soften-up8 [ORG BP  ] and that at some point the [ORG GOR  ] will use [ORG TNK-BP  ] 's deteriorating performance to push [ORG AAR  ] aside and negotiate a new agreement with [ORG BP  ] . 
End Summary. ------------------ [PER DUDLEY  ] LEAVES TOWN ------------------ 2 . 
( C ) As widely reported in the press , [ORG TNK-BP  ] CEO [PER Bob Dudley  ] left [LOC Moscow  ] on July 24 , planning to continue to manage the company from abroad . 
According to [PER McCormick  ] , [PER Dudley  ] received information from a senior [ORG FSB  ] official with whom he has been in regular contact over many years that his visa would be denied by the [ORG Federal Migration Service  ] ( [ORG FMS  ] ) on July 25 . 
[PER McCormick  ] himself received the same report through another [ORG FSB  ] channel and passed that information to [PER Dudley  ] . 
[PER Graham  ] expressed outrage at this turn of events , noting that the [ORG FMS  ] , claim that [PER Dudley  ] lacked a valid contract was absurd . 
[MISC Russian  ] labor law clearly states that a fixed term contract remains valid after it expires unless it is specifically terminated , which [PER Vekselberg  ] recently tried and failed to get the [ORG TNK-BP Management Board  ] to approve . 
3 . 
( C ) [PER McCormick  ] explained that the administrative and legal harassment by [ORG GOR  ] entities , which he said has been coordinated by [ORG AAR  ] to pressure [PER Dudley  ] ( reftel ) , had also played a role in [PER Dudley  ] , s decision . 
He said that in addition to the uncertainties surrounding [PER Dudley  ] 's immigration status , [PER Dudley  ] faces a $900 million personal claim against him by [ORG AAR  ] for supposedly exceeding the company 's authorized capital expenditure program , a discrimination suit brought by a [MISC Russian  ] [ORG TNK-BP  ] employee , and an expected wave of further suits directed at [PER Dudley  ] personally . 
[PER McCormick  ] showed us an e-mail from [PER Dudley  ] informing [PER McCormick  ] that he was not in the [LOC UK  ] ( as reported by the press ) and not in the [LOC U.S.  ] [PER McCormick  ] said [PER Dudley  ] is going to continue to move around " as a precaution . 
" 4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) An official [ORG BP  ] statement expressed " regret " that the situation had lead [PER Dudley  ] to decide to leave , while [ORG BP  ] Chairman [PER Peter Sutherland  ] reacted much more harshly in a separate statement saying " [ORG AAR  ] are doing enormous damage to [LOC Russia  ] and to globalization . 
" [PER Sutherland  ] further noted that the [MISC Russian  ] state has been manipulated as a part of the campaign and that [ORG BP  ] has never been treated as poorly as it has been in [LOC Russia  ] . 
[ORG TNK-BP  ] Deputy Chairman [PER Lord Robertson  ] separately expressed " outrage " and warned that [ORG AAR  ] is " threatening the viability " of [ORG TNK-BP  ] . 
5 . 
( C ) With [PER Dudley  ] trying to manage the very difficult task of running [ORG TNK-BP  ] from an undisclosed location abroad and the company having lost the majority of its specialists , its future is uncertain . 
[PER Vladimir Konovalov  ] , head of the [ORG Petroleum Advisory Forum  ] , the association of [MISC Western  ] oil and gas companies in [LOC Russia  ] , told us July 25th that he expected [ORG AAR  ] to begin " wholesale looting " of the company , pushing [ORG BP  ] to arbitration in [LOC Stockholm  ] , as is called for in the [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00002153 002 OF 003 shareholder agreement . 
" Even by [MISC Russian  ] standards , this all looks pretty awful , " he added . 
[PER McCormick  ] also thought that with [PER Dudley  ] gone [ORG AAR  ] would soon begin stripping company assets at the lower levels . 
He claimed , for example , that the [MISC Russian  ] employee who brought the discrimination suit against [PER Dudley  ] has already been given sole ownership of a $9 million subsidiary called [ORG DINC.  ] --------------------------- [ORG BP  ] , S APPROACH: WAIT [ORG AAR  ] OUT --------------------------- 6 . 
( C ) [PER Graham  ] acknowledged the threat of asset stripping but said [ORG BP  ] was confident that it could rely on the &strong shareholder agreement " and its arbitration mechanism to protect its interests . 
He noted that the company has not yet suffered major damage , and that [ORG BP  ] can wait out short-term impacts on performance . 
" No matter what , we still have 50% of the company , and those barrels in the ground aren't going anywhere , " he said . 
[ORG BP  ] is also prepared to launch legal challenges , including in [LOC Russia  ] , to defend its interests , and , ultimately , to take matters to arbitration in [LOC Stockholm  ] , where it believes it would win . 
7 . 
( C ) [PER Graham  ] and [PER McCormick  ] both said that [ORG AAR  ] was motivated by the desire to maximize short term profits , while [ORG BP  ] wanted to grow the company . 
In that regard , [ORG AAR  ] 's actions could have the unintended consequence of causing [ORG TNK-BP  ] to be in breach of strict corporate governance clauses which are part of some $8 billion of loans the company has . 
If that happened , [PER Graham  ] suggested the creditor banks would likely prevent the company from paying out dividends , one of the major streams of income for the [ORG AAR  ] partners . 
Given that the [ORG AAR  ] partner , s main interest is short term profits , he said this situation plays to [ORG BP  ] , s advantage . 
In fact , [PER Graham  ] said , he was optimistic about the future of the company despite [PER Dudley  ] , s departure because with [PER Dudley  ] gone the focus was now squarely on the [ORG AAR  ] partners to deliver. ------------------------------------- EXPAT DEPARTURES THREAT TO OPERATIONS ------------------------------------- 8 . 
( C ) Both [PER McCormick  ] and [PER Graham  ] felt that the [ORG AAR  ] partners had overplayed their hand with respect to the foreign employees in [ORG TNK-BP  ] . 
[PER McCormick  ] confirmed that the 148 [ORG BP  ] secondees have left or are leaving [LOC Russia  ] , likely never to return . 
In addition , of the approximately 80 expat employees in [ORG TNK-BP  ] , 18 have either left or will be leaving shortly as their visas are not expected to be renewed . 
[PER McCormick  ] said 60 expat specialists is no where near enough to help run the 66,000 employee company and [ORG AAR  ] knows it . 
He related a recent exchange with [ORG AAR  ] partner [PER Viktor Vekselberg  ] in which [PER Vekselberg  ] complained to him and [PER Dudley  ] that he needed &his8 expats , including ten [ORG BP  ] secondees to run the gas operation he heads . 
[PER Dudley  ] had responded incredulously that [PER Vekselberg  ] should take this up with [PER Khan  ] . 
9 . 
( C ) [PER McCormick  ] said [PER Khan  ] hired two search firms six weeks ago to recruit expats to replace the secondees and direct hire staff that [ORG AAR  ] has , in effect , kicked out of [LOC Russia  ] . 
The replacements would work directly for [ORG AAR  ] . 
[PER Graham  ] , expressing both outrage at the hypocrisy and a hint of glee about [ORG AAR  ] 's predicament , noted that [PER Khan  ] isn't having much luck . 
He explained that specialists in the oil and gas business are in very high demand and know they can command salaries equal to what [ORG TNK-BP  ] is offering , without the complications now encountered by expats at [LOC TNK-BP.  ] ----------------------- [ORG AAR  ] IN SECHIN , S SIGHTS ? ----------------------- 10 . 
( C ) [PER Graham  ] underscored for us once more what a tremendous success [ORG TNK-BP  ] has been . 
It leads [MISC Russian  ] oil companies by almost any metric of operational efficiency and results . 
Perhaps the most telling statistics according to [PER Graham  ] is the $70 billion the company has paid the [ORG GOR  ] in taxes since 2003 and the nearly $18 billion in dividends and other pay outs to the [ORG AAR  ] partners . 
[PER Graham  ] said [ORG TNK-BP  ] was responsible for much of the [ORG AAR  ] billionaires , current wealth . 
He shared [LOC MOSCOW  ] 00002153 003 OF 003 with us an internal [ORG BP  ] analysis that shows that [ORG TNK-BP  ] assets comprise $35.7 billion of the $43.8 billion increase in the combined wealth of the [ORG AAR  ] partners from 2003 to 2008 . 
11 . 
( C ) [ORG TNK-BP  ] , s continued success was the subject of remarks by Deputy Prime Minister [PER Sechin  ] on July 24 , reported in the [MISC Russian  ] press , in which he praised [ORG BP  ] , s contributions to the [MISC Russian  ] oil and gas industry and underscored the importance to the [ORG GOR  ] of [ORG TNK-BP  ] , s continued good performance . 
Both [PER McCormick  ] and [PER Graham  ] said they interpreted [PER Sechin  ] , s comments as a warning to the [ORG AAR  ] partners not to let [ORG TNK-BP  ] , s performance slip . 
However , as [PER Dudley  ] , [PER McCormick  ] , and others have told us , results are likely to take a hit from the absence of [ORG BP  ] , s technical expertise and the disorder created by the shareholder dispute . 
COO [PER Tim Summers  ] made that claim public on July 24 , saying that the shareholder dispute may impact 2009 performance . 
12 . 
( C ) In addition , [PER Graham  ] told us [ORG AAR  ] needs [ORG BP  ] -- " they chose us , not the other way around . 
" He said [ORG AAR  ] , s overseas expansion plans have already been set back , with [PER Khan  ] having been rebuffed by the [MISC Libyans  ] and others who are shunning deals with [ORG TNK-BP  ] if the company isn't bringing [ORG BP  ] 's expertise to the table . 
This also will not be well-received by the [ORG GOR  ] , which has prioritized the overseas expansion of [MISC Russian  ] businesses . 
13 . 
( C ) According to [PER Graham  ] , [ORG BP  ] believes that [ORG AAR  ] is being used by the government to " soften " [ORG BP  ] in advance of negotiations leading to some form of state control of the company . 
[ORG BP  ] plans to simply ride out the storm for now , until the [ORG GOR  ] shows its hand and uses the company 's declining performance as an excuse to push [ORG AAR  ] out . 
At that point , he said , negotiations would begin in earnest . 
[PER Graham  ] added that [ORG BP  ] was comfortable with such a scenario . 
" We want to be here for the long term and we can do so only if the government wants us here ; just like everywhere else in the world , " he said . 
He added that [ORG BP  ] is well aware that the 50-50 ownership model , with a foreign CEO , is no longer viable in [LOC Russia.  ] ------- COMMENT ------- 14 . 
( C ) [PER Dudley  ] 's departure is likely to allow [ORG AAR  ] to act with a much freer hand , whether it has the legal authority to do so or not . 
However , [ORG TNK-BP  ] is unlikely to be able to continue to perform optimally without [ORG BP  ] , s expertise and as this becomes more evident , [ORG BP  ] is betting on the pressure from the government mounting on [ORG AAR  ] . 
What the [ORG GOR  ] ultimately wants , however , remains unclear and as a result , so is the future of [LOC Russia  ] 's third-largest oil producer .
