( C ) Summary . 
The [ORG Spanish Supreme Court  ] announced July 24 that it had annulled the six-year prison sentence handed down in September by [LOC Spain  ] 's [ORG National Court  ] against accused terrorist [PER Hamed Abderrahaman Ahmed  ] , known in the media as the " [MISC Spanish  ] [PER Taliban  ] . 
" [PER Abderrahaman  ] , a [MISC Spanish  ] national captured in [LOC Afghanistan  ] by [LOC U.S.  ] forces and held at [LOC Guantanamo  ] until being turned over to [MISC Spanish  ] authorities in February 2004 , was immediately released from prison . 
The [ORG Supreme Court  ] found that [MISC Spanish  ] prosecutors could not use any evidence collected during their interview with [PER Abderrahaman  ] while he was being held at [LOC Guantanamo  ] under conditions the [PER Court  ] termed " impossible to explain , much less justify . 
" The [PER Court  ] threw out other evidence collected against [PER Abderrahaman  ] prior to his capture in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and determined that prosecutors had skewed [PER Abderrahaman  ] 's testimony to incriminate him . 
This finding had an immediate effect on the case of [PER Lahcen Ikassrien  ] , a [MISC Moroccan  ] national and former [LOC Guantanamo  ] detainee tranferred to [MISC Spanish  ] custody in July 2005 . 
Prosecutors announced their recommendation to release [PER Ikassrien  ] on bail while awaiting trial on terrorism charges , while [PER Abderrahaman  ] 's attorney said he would sue the [LOC U.S.  ] Government for suffering allegedly suffered by [PER Abderrahaman  ] during his incarceration in [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
[MISC Spanish  ] officials involved in the [PER Abderrahaman  ] case expressed disappointment in his release , but also said that he was not particularly dangerous and dismissed him as a threat . 
This ruling does not indicate a reduction in counter-terrorism cooperation by [MISC Spanish  ] law enforcement officials , but the [ORG Supreme Court  ] 's decisions will clearly have to be taken into account as we pursue improved judicial cooperation with [LOC Spain  ] . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] judicial branch carefully guards its hard-won indepence , meaning it will not shy away from rulings that cut across [MISC Spanish  ] Government ( or [ORG USG  ] ) objectives . 
End Summary. //BACKGROUND// <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( S ) According to sentencing documents , [PER Abderrahaman  ] established contacts with al-Qa'ida elements in the [MISC Spanish  ] enclave of [LOC Ceuta  ] and , in August 2001 , traveled to [LOC Afghanistan  ] for religious and military training in [LOC Kandahar  ] . 
When the [LOC U.S.  ] invaded [LOC Afghanistan  ] in the wake of the September 11 attacks , [PER Abderrahaman  ] fled to [LOC Pakistan  ] , where he was reportedly captured by the [MISC Pakistani  ] military , who turned him over to [LOC U.S.  ] forces . 
[PER Abderrahaman  ] was transferred to [LOC Guantanamo  ] , where he was held until he was turned over to [MISC Spanish  ] authorities in February 2004 in response to a request by magistrate [PER Baltasar Garzon  ] , who wanted to investigate [PER Abderrahaman  ] in connection with the trial of al-Qa'ida cell leader [PER Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas  ] . 
Under the terms of that transfer , [MISC Spanish  ] authorities agreed to: -- Be prepared to detain , investigate , and prosecute [PER Abderrahaman  ] , while treating him humanely ; -- Share with [ORG USG  ] authorities any information developed during the investigation ; -- Provide reasonable notice of any decision to release or transfer [PER Abderrahaman  ] ; -- Conduct surveillance of [PER Abderrahaman  ] following his release , and share any relevant information with the [LOC U.S.  ] ; and , -- Provide [LOC U.S.  ] officials access to [PER Abderrahaman  ] if necessary. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S ) [PER Garzon  ] released [PER Abderrahaman  ] on bail in July 2004 , finding that [ORG Spanish National Police  ] interrogations of [PER Abderrahaman  ] while he was being held in [LOC Guantanamo  ] could not be used as evidence . 
However , the [ORG National Police  ] had previous wiretap evidence linking [PER Abderrahaman  ] to [MISC Barakat Yarkas  ] as well as what they viewed as incriminating statements by [PER Abderrahaman  ] to police investigators following his release from [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
In early 2005 , a confidential police assessment shared with [ORG USG  ] officials concluded that [PER Abderrahaman  ] had the " mental maturity of a 12-year-old , " was " naive and foolish , " and did not seem to comprehend the gravity of his detention in [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
But the report also noted [PER Abderrahaman  ] 's consistent statements to [MISC Spanish  ] police that he wanted to " go fight with the [MISC Chechens  ] and kill [MISC Russians  ] . 
" ( REF B ) . 
Police provided this information to prosecutors and to the [ORG National Court  ] , which found [LOC MADRID  ] 00001914 002.2 OF 003 [PER Abderrahaman  ] guilty in September 2005 of " membership in a terrorist organization . 
" The case was then automatically transferred to the [ORG Supreme Court  ] to either overturn or confirm the sentence. //SUPREME [ORG COURT  ] THROWS OUT CONVICTION// <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( U ) The [ORG Supreme Court  ] overturned [PER Abderrahaman  ] 's conviction on the basis that the [ORG National Court  ] had allowed prosecutors to use inadmissible evidence to establish [PER Abderrahaman  ] 's guilt and that prosecutors had improperly translated [PER Abderrahaman  ] 's incriminating testimony . 
Specifically , the [ORG Supreme Court  ] found that testimony obtained by [MISC Spanish  ] police investigators during the course of interviews of [PER Abderrahaman  ] in [LOC Guantanamo  ] could not be used in court because the " interrogations , euphemistically called " interviews , " took place under unequal circumstances because ( the defendant ) was in detention " at the time of the interrogations . 
Further , the [ORG Supreme Court  ] finding stated that " although it is not for ( this [PER Court  ] ) to issue a pronouncement regarding the situation of those held in indefinite detention , we must state that , as [PER Ahmed  ] was held in detention under the authority of the [LOC U.S.  ] military since he was turned over ( to the [LOC U.S  ] . 
) on an undetermined date , all information obtained under such conditions must be declared totally null and nonexistent . 
" The [PER Court  ] did go on to pronounce its position on [LOC Guantanamo  ] , criticizing the detention of " hundreds of people , among them [PER Ahmed  ] , without charges , without rights , without controls , and without limits , " a situation the [ORG Court  ] termed " impossible to explain , much less justify . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( U ) Just as damaging to the prosecution 's case was the [ORG Court  ] 's decision to throw out telephone intercepts incriminating [PER Abderrahaman  ] obtained during the course of the [MISC Barakat Yarkas  ] investigation and long before [PER Abderrahaman  ] 's detention in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The judges found that the intercepts had been obtained improperly ( NOTE: the [ORG Supreme Court  ] had already ruled against allowing the intercepts during its review of the convictions of [MISC Barakat Yarkas  ] cell members ) . 
The [ORG Supreme Court  ] also determined that prosecutors had improperly translated [PER Abderrahaman  ] 's statements and had omitted exculpatory evidence , such as [PER Abderrahaman  ] 's declaration that he did not belong to al-Qa'ida and had not received military training . 
The [ORG Court  ] criticized prosecutors for omitting a document " signed in [LOC Guantanamo  ] by [PER Abderrahaman  ] before being turned over to [MISC Spanish  ] authorities , " a document in which [LOC U.S.  ] authorities allegedly acknowledged that [PER Abderrahaman  ] was not a member of al-Qa'ida . 
On this basis , the [ORG Supreme Court  ] found that the case against [PER Abderrahaman  ] failed to meet the minimum standards established by the [ORG European Court of Human Rights  ] for a finding of " guilty beyond a reasonable doubt . 
" <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Legat contacted [PER Eduardo Fungairino  ] , currently the head of an anti-terrorism office assigned to the [ORG Supreme Court  ] and formerly the chief of the [ORG National Prosecutor  ] 's office , on July 25 for his insights into the [PER Abderrahaman  ] decision . 
[PER Fungairino  ] ( strictly protect ) dismissed the [ORG Supreme Court  ] decision as " facile and populist . 
" He said that while he acknowledged errors on the part of [ORG National Court  ] prosecutors in the case ( and the legal problems generated by the circumstances at [LOC Guantanamo  ] ) , in his view the [ORG Supreme Court  ] ignored evidence of [PER Abderrahaman  ] 's terrorist training in [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] , activities that are clearly criminal under [MISC Spanish  ] law . 
[PER Fungairino  ] indicated that one consolation , in his view , was that [PER Abderrahaman  ] did not represent a serious threat , echoing police assessments that [PER Abderrahaman  ] was a pawn in events beyond his understanding ( see para 3 ) . //ABDERRAHAMAN PLANS TO SUE USG// <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( U ) In a July 25 press conference organized by [PER Abderrahaman  ] attorney [PER Marcos Garcia Montes  ] , [PER Abderrahaman  ] told reporters that he hoped to gain employment as a truck driver and claimed that his vision had degraded so much during his detention in [LOC Guantanamo  ] that he was unfit for other employment . 
[PER Garcia Montes  ] said that he planned to file a " multimillion dollar suit " against the [ORG U.S. Government  ] for damages , including post-traumatic stress and vision loss on the part of his client . 
The attorney told reporters that [PER Abderrahaman  ] 's suffering had been such that he could no longer recall specific elements of his detention in [LOC Guantanamo  ] , nor of his time in [LOC Pakistan  ] and [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Abderrahaman  ] roundly denied ever having been a terrorist and insisted that his prior references to himself as a " martyr " referred to his treatment in detention . 
Prompted by his [LOC MADRID  ] 00001914 003.2 OF 003 attorney , [PER Abderrahaman  ] related his alleged mistreatment in [LOC U.S.  ] detention , including the presence of a powerful lightbulb in his cell that impeded sleep and threats that he would never see his family again . 
[PER Abderrahaman  ] said he planned to write a book about his experiences. //IKASSRIEN ALSO TO BE RELEASED// <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( U ) Following the [ORG Supreme Court  ] decision in the [PER Abderrahaman  ] case , [ORG National Court  ] prosecutors announced that they would support the release on bail of [MISC Moroccan  ] national [PER Lahcen Ikassrien  ] , who was transferred to [LOC Spain  ] from [LOC Guantanamo  ] in July 2005 and held in preventive detention since his arrival . 
This comes less than a month after prosecutors filed formal charges against [PER Ikassrien  ] , seeking an eight-year prison term on charges of membership in a terrorist organization . 
The case against [PER Ikassrien  ] is based on three police interviews with him when he was being held at [LOC Guantanamo  ] ( by the same investigators who interviewed [PER Abderrahaman  ] ) and on telephone intercepts developed in the course of the [MISC Barakat Yarkas  ] investigation , the same evidence thrown out in the [PER Abderrahaman  ] case . 
( NOTE: According to press reports , the [MISC Spanish  ] police intercepts place [PER Ikassrien  ] in [LOC Istanbul  ] , [LOC Turkey  ] in November 2000 along with suspected terrorists [PER Amer Azizi  ] and Said [PER Berraj  ] . 
In a separate intercept , [PER Ikassrien  ] requested assistance with documentation from al-Qa'ida cell leader [MISC Barakat Yarkas  ] ) . 
Prosecutors have maintained that [PER Ikassrien  ] 's own testimony since his transfer from [LOC Guantanamo  ] incriminates him since he has acknowledged traveling to [LOC Afghanistan  ] to " collaborate with the [MISC Islamist  ] regime . 
" That is disputed by court observers who say that [PER Ikassrien  ] 's statements to the [ORG National Court  ] have been substantially less incriminating than those of [PER Abderrahaman  ] <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( U ) [PER Ikassrien  ] 's attorney has already homed in on [LOC Guantanamo  ] as key to his client 's defense , focusing on [PER Ikassrien  ] 's alleged mistreatment while in [LOC US  ] custody . 
The attorney 's request claims that " while [PER Ikassrien  ] was in [LOC Guantanamo  ] , he was gassed , beaten , mistreated , and insulted , and subject to repeated inspections , during which the military officials undertaking the inspections would damage or destroy ( [PER Ikassrien  ] 's ) books , especially the [MISC Koran  ] . 
" [PER Ikassrien  ] 's attorney also alleges that his client was forcibly injected with a substance that led to severe itching that continues to affect him. //COMMENT// <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) [MISC Spanish  ] counter-terrorism legislation was designed over three decades to combat [ORG ETA  ] , a group with a defined structure , doctrine , and modus operandi . 
Police , prosecutors , and magistrates working on investigations of the far more amorphous cells of [MISC Islamist  ] extremist have struggled to develop evidence sufficient to meet the high threshhold set by the [ORG Spanish Supreme Court  ] . 
This was reflected in an earlier decision by the [ORG Supreme Court  ] to reverse the convictions of several [MISC Barakat Yarkas  ] cell members and to reduce [MISC Barakat Yarkas'  ] sentence on the basis that prosecutors had not proved his connection to the September 11 attacks in the [LOC U.S  ] . 
( USG observers of the trial noted that the evidence on the September 11 connection was indeed weak ) . 
Clearly , in the [PER Abderrahaman  ] case the [ORG Supreme Court  ] was also eager to use this case as a platform to criticize [LOC U.S.  ] detainee policies in [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
While this sentiment has not influenced [MISC Spanish  ] police to reduce their close collaboration with the [LOC U.S.  ] in fighting terrorism , we must take it into account as we pursue increased judicial cooperation with [LOC Spain  ] in terrorism cases . 
The [MISC Spanish  ] judiciary carefully guards its independence ( a major achievement of the post-Franco era ) and has not shied from taking decisions that cut across the obectives of the [ORG Spanish Government  ] .
