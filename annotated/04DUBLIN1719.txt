End summary. ------------ Introduction ------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) The November 14-15 visit of [ORG U.S. Treasury  ] Secretary [PER John W. Snow  ] was an opportunity for substantive discussion on the “secrets” of [LOC Ireland  ] , s economic success . 
During a dinner hosted by the Ambassador and a lunch arranged by the [ORG Ulster Bank  ] , Secretary [PER Snow  ] spoke with 16 policy-makers and businessmen ( listed in para 12 ) who were instrumental in the emergence of the [MISC Celtic Tiger  ] economy . 
A breakfast with the [ORG American Chamber of Commerce  ] and a classroom exchange at [ORG Dublin City University  ] ( [ORG DCU  ] ) reinforced the points made by these key figures . 
The following are the principal insights that emerged from Secretary [PER Snow  ] , s visit ( which are organized thematically , not in the sequential order in which they were discussed ) . --------------------------------------------- -------- In the [LOC Beginning: Political  ] Will and [LOC Industrial Peace  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Although the concepts behind [LOC Ireland  ] , s reforms had been simple , the political will to carry out the reforms had only come in the context of the mid-1980s , economic meltdown , said [PER Padraig O  ] , hUiginn , former Secretary General in the Office of the [ORG Taoiseach  ] ( Prime Minister ) . 
[PER O  ] , hUiginn recalled drafting a proposal for economic recovery during that era , using ideas that were “apparent to any first-year economics graduate student” ) cut the fiscal deficit , spur competition , lower corporate taxes , etc . 
The ruling party at the time , [PER Fine Gael  ] , did not act on the proposal , but the [ORG Fianna Fail  ] government elected in 1987 made the document the basis for the [ORG Program of National Recovery  ] ( [ORG PNR  ] ) , which set forth the policies that underpinned [LOC Ireland  ] , s economic turnaround . 
[ORG Fianna Fail  ] , s “great advantage” at the time , said [PER O  ] , hUiginn , was [LOC Ireland  ] , s economic crisis ; with 18 percent unemployment and government debt at 130 percent of GDP , the political opposition , industry , and labor could not afford politically to impede solutions . 
The [ORG PNR  ] , s linchpin was labor , s decision to accept a moderate wage increases in exchange for income tax relief , which became the basic approach to successive national wage-setting ( [ORG Social Partnership  ] ) agreements . 
[PER O  ] , hUiginn recounted that the Government offered [MISC Irish  ] pounds 700 million in tax relief in 1987 and also cut the fiscal deficit , forcing the closure of several hospitals and the retrenchment of 16,000 civil servants . 
He noted that the moderate wage increase incorporated in the [ORG PNR  ] laid the foundation for [LOC Ireland  ] , s competitiveness as an export platform and as a draw for foreign direct investment ( FDI ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The Government , s good-faith dealings with unions in negotiating [ORG Social Partnership  ] agreements were , and remained , central to [LOC Ireland  ] , s economic success , said [PER Peter Cassells  ] , former General Secretary of the [MISC Irish  ] [ORG Congress  ] of [ORG Trade Unions  ] . 
According to [PER Cassells  ] , a shared understanding between unions and the Government on the importance of decent wages and housing for workers was the basis of labor , s commitment to the [ORG Social Partnership  ] approach . 
He added that the transparency and inclusiveness of wage-setting negotiations , in which even the most disgruntled union representatives were given voice , were also instrumental to success . 
The typical industrial relations model in which union chiefs and politicians hammered out back-room agreements , in the mode of [PER Lyndon Johnson  ] and [PER Lane Kirkland  ] , would not have secured labor buy-in to economic reforms , [PER Cassells  ] asserted . 
He further observed that the [ORG Social Partnership  ] approach might not be replicable in other [ORG EU  ] Member States , which typically were more populous than [LOC Ireland  ] and had more diffuse union structures. ---------------------- The [ORG Key: Human Capital  ] ---------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The chief source of [LOC Ireland  ] , s success has been its educated labor force , said [ORG EU  ] Commissioner-designate and former [MISC Irish  ] Finance Minister [PER Charlie McCreevy  ] . 
He noted that the introduction of free primary and secondary education in the 1960-70s initially benefited other countries as much as [LOC Ireland  ] , due to the emigration of educated [MISC Irish  ] workers . 
As a young parliamentarian , moreover , [PER McCreevy  ] had warned that the 1970s , baby boom was a looming disaster , on the pretext that [LOC Ireland  ] , s small , weak economy could not accommodate a future surge in labor , even with emigration . 
As it turned out , this large pool of young , educated workers became [LOC Ireland  ] , s principal resource and the main attraction for foreign multinationals to establish subsidiaries in the country . 
Far from a disaster , the period 1987-2003 saw the addition of 600,000 jobs to the economy and drop in the unemployment rate from 18 percent to 4 percent . 
This success , concluded [PER McCreevy  ] , was primarily attributable to [LOC Ireland  ] , s investment in human capital. ------------------------ “Dictatorial” Leadership ------------------------ <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The implementation of reforms that underpinned [LOC Ireland  ] , s economic recovery had required “dictatorial” leadership , said [PER McCreevy  ] . 
This involved incenitivizing industries to achieve efficiencies by exposing them to the full discipline of the market , even at the risk of bankruptcies . 
The challenge in this approach , explained [PER McCreevy  ] , was to press ahead with reforms in the face of elections , which provided temptations for politicians to adopt softer , more populist economic platforms . 
Secretary [PER Snow  ] observed that whereas the gains from economic reforms in any country tended to be diffuse , the losses were often concentrated in particular sectors or geographic areas , making it easier for those affected to organize political opposition . 
[PER McCreevy  ] commented that the test of any government was how well it explained to dislocated workers that the reforms responsible for their plight were good for the country . 
[ORG Indecon Economic Consultants  ] CEO [PER Alan Gray  ] separately pointed out that [LOC Ireland  ] had succeeded , through education , in giving workers the skills to move across industries , to the point now where those laid off did not ask , “Do I have any hope of a job ? ” but rather “Which one of my new employment choices should I take ? ” ------- [ORG EU  ] Help ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [ORG EU  ] tools , primarily structural support funds , were another factor in the emergence of [LOC Ireland  ] , s [MISC Celtic Tiger  ] economy , explained former Prime Minister ( 1992-95 ) [PER Albert Reynolds  ] and [PER Ray McSharry  ] , former [ORG EU  ] Commissioner and [MISC Irish  ] Finance Minister . 
[PER Reynolds  ] said that the [MISC Irish  ] Government did not shy from viewing such tools as entitlements , since [LOC Ireland  ] , as an island nation , faced additional challenges trading within the [ORG European Community  ] . 
He and [PER McSharry  ] recalled that [LOC Ireland  ] had negotiated well to maximize the level of [ORG EU  ] support . 
For example , [PER Reynolds  ] claimed that he had obtained over euro one billion from [LOC Brussels  ] as a result of a discussion with [PER Chancellor Kohl  ] in which [PER Reynolds  ] agreed to support [LOC Germany  ] , s push for rapid [ORG EU  ] enlargement . 
[ORG EU  ] Commissioner-designate [PER McCreevy  ] separately echoed [PER Reynolds  ] , points , saying that [MISC French  ] Finance Minister [PER Sarkozy  ] , s proposal to reduce [ORG EU  ] support for new Member States that applied low corporate tax rates was shortsighted . 
[PER McCreevy  ] said that any [ORG EU  ] measures to increase growth in the new Member States would redound to the benefit of the entire EU. --------------------------- [ORG U.S. Policy  ] on Tax Deferral --------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The [LOC U.S.  ] policy of tax deferral for foreign subsidiaries of [MISC American  ] firms , combined with [LOC Ireland  ] , s 12.5 percent corporate tax rate , underpinned the large influx of [LOC U.S.  ] investment to [LOC Ireland  ] during the [MISC Celtic Tiger  ] period , observed [PER Padraic White  ] , former CEO of [LOC Ireland  ] , s [ORG Industrial Development Authority  ] ( [ORG IDA  ] ) . 
[PER White  ] recounted his numerous trips to the [ORG U.S. House of Representatives  ] , Ways and [ORG Means Committee  ] to defend tax deferral , and he argued that Senator [PER Kerry  ] , s plan to reverse tax deferral would have “killed [LOC Ireland  ] , ” had he been elected . 
[PER White  ] believed that complaints by the [LOC U.S.  ] public about the job outsourcing that accompanied [LOC U.S.  ] investment flows were wrong-headed . 
[LOC U.S.  ] subsidiaries in [LOC Ireland  ] , he argued , were the principle reason that the [LOC United States  ] had penetrated the personal computer , software , and pharmaceutical markets in [LOC Europe  ] . 
He further observed that under-performing [LOC U.S.  ] companies were typically those that had not attempted to expand overseas . 
Secretary [PER Snow  ] concurred that [LOC U.S.  ] companies that were outsourcing overseas were those creating the most jobs in the [LOC United States  ] . 
He highlighted , however , the political difficulty of explaining outsourcing to the [LOC U.S.  ] public , recalling slogans during the recent election campaign that criticized “Benedict [PER Arnold CEOs.”  ] ------------------------------------------ A Propitious Lack of [ORG Monetary Policy Tools  ] ------------------------------------------ <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) An ironic feature of [LOC Ireland  ] , s success has been the Government , s lack of monetary policy tools , remarked [PER Cormack McCarthy  ] , Chief Executive of the [ORG Ulster Bank  ] . 
One might think that a country that had performed so well in terms of exports and investment would have relied heavily on interest rate and exchange rate levers , said [PER McCarthy  ] . 
As a euro-zone member , in fact , [LOC Ireland  ] had ceded control of its monetary policy to the [ORG European Central Bank  ] . 
The positive result , said [PER McCarthy  ] , were low interest rates . 
He believed that if [LOC Ireland  ] had remained control of monetary policy , the Government would have been tempted to raise interest rates to slow rapid growth in the late 1990s . 
Instead , the low rates set by the [ORG ECB  ] had been a boon to [LOC Ireland  ] , s private sector and had lent a sense of stability and consistency to the [MISC Irish  ] market for foreign investors. -------------------------------------------- Looking Ahead: Competitiveness and Education -------------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Looking ahead , the principal danger for [LOC Ireland  ] is complacency , said [PER Eoin O  ] , [PER Driscoll  ] , Chairman of [ORG Forfas  ] ( the Government think-tank ) and the [ORG Government-commissioned Enterprise Strategy Group  ] ( [ORG ESG  ] ) . 
Echoing the [ORG ESG  ] , s recently published findings , [PER O  ] , [PER Driscoll  ] cited the need to ensure [LOC Ireland  ] , s continued competitiveness as a magnet for foreign direct investment ( [ORG FDI  ] ) , which , he said , had driven the country , s economic transformation . 
( [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC Irish  ] businesspersons who attended the November 15 [MISC American  ] Chamber of [LOC Commerce  ] breakfast with Secretary [PER Snow  ] made similar points , noting that multinationals were increasingly attracted by low-cost manufacturing opportunities in [LOC China  ] and [LOC India  ] . 
) [PER O  ] , [PER Driscoll  ] said that , just as industry and Government had collaborated in the 1990s to make [LOC Ireland  ] a base for leading bio-pharmaceutical and IT companies , the country needed a new shared vision to go another rung higher in the production of innovative , high-value goods and services . 
He note that this challenge would involve marrying innovation to better business practices , particularly in sales and marketing , and he praised the [LOC U.S.  ] model of perfecting product designs in the market , as opposed to the [MISC European  ] preference of the laboratory . 
While Secretary [PER Snow  ] cautioned against government attempts to pick winners in the market , he ventured that the key to economic prosperity rested with countries like the [LOC United States  ] that fostered a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) Secretary [PER Snow  ] , s classroom discussion with students , professors , and administrators at [ORG Dublin City University  ] ( [ORG DCU  ] ) was a venue for further discussion on the role of innovation , entrepreneurship , and academia in strengthening the [MISC Irish  ] economy . 
The event took place at [ORG DCU  ] , s “Invent Center , ” which serves as a business incubator for student entrepreneurs and community start-up companies . 
Secretary [PER Snow  ] highlighted the centrality of education and SIPDIS intellectual capital to the modern , knowledge-based economy , and he explained that to embrace a market economy was to embrace ever-changing needs for new ideas and skills . 
He also noted the difficulties that economists had encountered in finding ways to capture creativity , “that spark , ” in modeling economic activity . 
[ORG DCU  ] president [PER Ferdinand von Prondzynski  ] commented that the university had encountered a similar challenge , but espoused the belief that entrepreneurship could be taught , in the same way as poetry , painting , and other modes of creativity . 
[PER Prondzynski  ] also stressed that innovation meant little without business skills , and he cited [ORG DCU  ] requirements for students to establish relationships [MISC Irish  ] entrepreneurs who had both succeeded and failed in bringing new ideas to the market. -------------------------------- Participants in the “Architect” Discussions with Secretary [PER Snow  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 .
