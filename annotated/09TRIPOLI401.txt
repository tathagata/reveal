Cretz  ] , Ambassador , [LOC U.S.  ] Embassy - [LOC Tripoli  ] , [LOC U.S.  ] Dept of State . 
REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) 1 . 
( C ) Summary: The two months since your last visit to [LOC Tripoli  ] have been marked by key developments in the [LOC U.S.-Libya  ] bilateral relationship and in regional security affairs . 
Your meeting with [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] will afford a key opportunity to engage at the strategic level , explain [ORG U.S. Africa Command  ] 's mission and potentially mitigate possible [MISC Libyan  ] obstruction of the [ORG Command  ] 's efforts on the continent . 
Al-Qadhafi is unlikely to become a vocal supporter of [ORG U.S. Africa Command  ] , but his tacit acquiescence to its mission will be critical to deeper engagement . 
His desire for a successful chairmanship of the [ORG African Union  ] could afford a useful point of leverage to gain quiet acceptance of [ORG U.S. Africa Command  ] 's efforts . 
During then-Secretary Rice 's September 2008 visit , [PER al-Qadhafi  ] warned that [LOC U.S.  ] military intervention on the continent concerned [MISC Africans  ] and could encourage popular support for terrorism . 
[LOC Africa  ] , he said , would be " greatly comforted " if [ORG U.S. Africa Command  ] continued to base its operations in [LOC Europe  ] . 
Your meeting with Foreign Minister [PER Musa Kusa  ] is a chance to engage in both a strategic discussion and a dialogue about specific potential areas of cooperation , which he can cast in terms palatable to [LOC Libya  ] 's leadership . 
[ORG National Security Adviser  ] [PER Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi met with Secretary [PER Clinton  ] and [ORG National Security Advisor Jones  ] , as well as the Deputy Secretaries of [MISC Defense  ] and [ORG Homeland Security  ] and the Deputy Director of [ORG CIA  ] , during his April 21-24 visit to [LOC Washington  ] . 
He asked for greater defense cooperation , speedy resolution to [LOC Libya  ] 's request to procure lethal military equipment and greater support for counter-terrorism ( [LOC CT  ] ) and border security efforts . 
He reiterated [LOC Libya  ] 's aversion to membership in [MISC Trans-Sahara Counter-Terrorism Partnership  ] ( [ORG TSCTP  ] ) , saying the [ORG Tripoli-based Community of Sahel-Saharan States  ] ( [MISC CEN-SAD  ] ) and the [ORG North Africa Standby Force  ] ( [ORG NASF  ] ) obviated [ORG TSCTP  ] 's mission . 
Your meeting with [PER Muatassim  ] will afford an opportunity to discuss specific cooperation opportunities and programs , including [ORG NASF  ] . 
End summary . 
Key issues: -- Meeting with Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] -- Al-Qadhafi 's Tenure as [ORG African Union Chairman: Promise & Peril  ] -- [PER Musa Kusa  ] 's growing [LOC Africa  ] portfolio ; -- Meeting [PER Muatassim  ] al-Qadhafi after his [LOC Washington  ] visit ; -- Engagement opportunities: [ORG North Africa Standby Force/Chad-Sudan Border Force  ] ; -- Lethal weapon sales to [LOC Libya  ] MEETING WITH LEADER MUAMMAR AL-QADHAFI 2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Al-Qadhafi is a famously mercurial interlocutor: his comportment ranges from quiet and difficult to engage - he will sometimes go so far as to avoid eye contact altogether - to holding forth in rambling , non-linear fashion . 
He is keenly focused on [MISC African  ] issues and credible reporting suggests that he genuinely aspires to be the founding father of a [LOC United States  ] of [LOC Africa  ] . 
He will be interested in hearing your views , but will be suspicious of [ORG U.S. Africa Command  ] 's potential ulterior motives and wary of how those could complicate his own efforts to strengthen his leadership role on the continent . 
As in his meeting with then-Secretary Rice , he will likely prefer a strategic and even philosophical discussion rather than an exchange focused on details . 
3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Al-Qadhafi  ] views himself as a man of particular historical importance and has long sought to leverage leadership of [LOC Libya  ] into a more prominent trans-national role . 
His interest in [LOC Africa  ] dates to the late-1980 's and early 1990 's , when it became clear that efforts to posit [LOC Libya  ] as a leading [MISC Arab  ] state were unlikely to succeed . 
[PER Al-Qadhafi  ] prides himself on [LOC Libya  ] 's humanitarian activities on the continent , which are primarily focused on improving conditions for women and children . 
In the mid-1970 's , [LOC Libya  ] established the [ORG Tripoli-based World Islamic Call Society  ] ( [ORG WICS  ] ) , an educational institution mandated to provide [MISC Arabic  ] language and religious training to foreign candidates for the [MISC Islamic  ] clergy as a means to propagate more moderate iterations of [LOC Islam  ] in [LOC sub-Saharan Africa  ] and [LOC Asia  ] . 
[PER Al-Qadhafi  ] and senior regime officials often point to [ORG WICS  ] when claiming that [LOC Libya  ] was ahead of the international community in recognizing the dangers of [MISC Islamic  ] fundamentalism ( invariably described as " [MISC Wahhabism  ] " ) and moving to actively counter it . 
[LOC Libya  ] also has significant commercial investments in [LOC sub-Saharan Africa  ] , and has leveraged those as [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000401 002.2 OF 003 part of its " dinar diplomacy " approach to managing relations on the continent . 
4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In public remarks , al-Qadhafi excoriates [MISC European  ] states for having colonized [LOC Africa  ] and strongly argues against external interference in internal [MISC African  ] affairs . 
He is marginally less strident in private and has negotiated a colonial compensation treaty with [LOC Italy  ] and accepted [ORG EU  ] assistance to counter illegal migration and bolster border security ; however , a defining event for his regime was the expulsion of [LOC U.S.  ] and [MISC British  ] forces from the [MISC Wheelus  ] and al-Adem airbases , respectively . 
The presence of non-African military elements in [LOC Libya  ] or elsewhere on the continent remains a neuralgic issue for al-Qadhafi . 
In a meeting of [MISC CEN-SAD  ] intelligence chiefs in [LOC Tripoli  ] earlier this week , [LOC Libya  ] 's new [ORG External Security Organization  ] Director decried as latter-day colonialism [MISC Western  ] attempts to " interfere " in [MISC African  ] security and intelligence affairs and argued that [MISC Africans  ] could and should undertake counter-terrorism and intelligence efforts themselves . 
( Note: Despite that stated position , [LOC Libya  ] seeks " support " in the form of training and equipment . 
End note . 
) 5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) That said , [LOC Libya  ] recognizes that [MISC African  ] peacekeeping and regional security forces are poorly trained and equipped and may be amenable to [LOC U.S.  ] assistance in these areas . 
Another area of potential cooperation is de-mining: we have proposed [LOC U.S.  ] assistance ( under [ORG UN  ] auspices ) for [MISC Libyan  ] de-mining efforts . 
The [ORG UN  ] is waiting for al-Qadhafi 's approval ( some contacts say he is reluctant to give up extensively mined zones on the [MISC Chadian  ] and [MISC Egyptian  ] borders ) and is concerned that a [MISC DoD/U.S.  ] affiliation could complicate the effort . 
[LOC Libya  ] 's recent efforts to persuade [MISC Tuareg  ] tribes in the [LOC Libya-Chad-Niger-Algeria-Mali  ] area to surrender their arms and publicly spurn cooperation with al-Qaeda elements in the [LOC Sahel  ] is another potential area to explore , although he will likely resist offers of [LOC U.S.  ] military cooperation in what he views as his backyard . 
AL-QADHAFI'S TENURE AS CHAIRMAN OF THE [ORG AFRICAN UNION  ] 6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Al-Qadhafi 's chairmanship of the [ORG African Union  ] represents the fulfillment of a long-term , closely held personal goal and coincides with an important period for the regime . 
Significant political events in 2009 also include the tenth anniversary of the [ORG Sirte Declaration  ] that brought the [ORG AU  ] into being , [LOC Libya  ] 's non-permanent UNSC chair , the likelihood that longtime [LOC Africa  ] hand [PER Ali Treiki  ] will serve as President of the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] , and the 40th anniversary of the bloodless coup that brought al-Qadhafi to power . 
[LOC Libya  ] will seek to use al-Qadhafi 's chairmanship to aggrandize him and promote his [LOC United States  ] of [LOC Africa  ] proposal ; some sub-Saharan states appear to have already written off 2009-2010 as a " lost year " in terms of [ORG AU  ] initiatives . 
That notwithstanding , it will be important to show appropriate deference to him and his perceived leadership role on the continent . 
Despite his warnings against [MISC Western  ] interference in [LOC Africa  ] , al-Qadhafi needs his [ORG AU  ] chairmanship to be seen as a success - a potentially useful opening for increased engagement . 
When possible , crafting programs that give [LOC Libya  ] a symbolic leadership role reduces the chance that al-Qadhafi will play the spoiler . 
[PER MUSA KUSA'S  ] EXPANDING AFRICA PORTFOLIO 7 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Musa Kusa  ] was named Foreign Minister just before your last visit , and was dual-hatted as [ORG External Security Organization  ] ( [ORG ESO  ] ) chief for several weeks before a new [ORG External Security Organization  ] Director was named . 
( Note: The extent to which [PER Kusa  ] has relinquished control of day-to-day intelligence operations remains unclear . 
The new [ORG ESO  ] Director , [PER Abuzeid Dorda  ] , is a former Prime Minister and most recently served as the Chairman of the high-profile Housing and [ORG Infrastructure Board  ] ; however , he does not have experience in intelligence and security issues . 
End note . 
) [PER Kusa  ] frequently travels with [PER Muammar  ] al-Qadhafi and is a principal advisor on security matters . 
He is [MISC Western-educated  ] - he holds an [MISC M.A.  ] from [ORG Michigan State  ] - and is seen as a strong supporter of re-engagement with the [LOC West  ] . 
The Ambassador and [ORG GRPO  ] have met him frequently and he has played a prominent role in [LOC U.S.-Libya  ] relations and , more broadly , in [LOC Libya  ] 's foreign affairs . 
Since becoming Foreign Minister , he has assumed several portfolios previously held by other prominent regime figures , notably replacing Dr. [PER Ali Treiki  ] as point man for [MISC Chad-Sudan  ] mediation . 
[PER Kusa  ] co-chaired a May 3 meeting in [LOC Doha  ] with [MISC Qatari  ] leaders at [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00000401 003.2 OF 003 which the two governments signed a normalization agreement , and co-chaired with the [MISC Qatari  ] Minister of State a March 15 meeting in [LOC Tripoli  ] aimed at uniting smaller [LOC Darfur  ] rebel factions to facilitate peace talks with the Government of [LOC Sudan  ] . 
8 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Kusa  ] is a key mentor for [PER Muatassim  ] and served as his " minder " during the latter 's first trip to the [LOC U.S.  ] in September 2007 to attend the [ORG UN General Assembly  ] . 
[PER Muatassim  ] made his latest trip without [PER Kusa  ] , but the two likely consult extensively on matters of security and intelligence . 
[PER Kusa  ] previously served ( circa 2004-2006 ) as a mentor to [PER Muatassim  ] 's brother and potential rival to succeed their father , [PER Saif  ] al-Islam al-Qadhafi , and reportedly remains close to him . 
[PER Kusa  ] is the rare [MISC Libyan  ] official who embodies a combination of intellectual acumen , operational ability and political weight . 
Promoting specific areas of cooperation with him is an opportunity to have him cast that message in terms palatable to [LOC Libya  ] 's leadership . 
MEETING [ORG MUATASSIM POST-WASHINGTON  ] 9 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Muatassim  ] visited [LOC Washington  ] to meet high-level representatives from State , [LOC DoD  ] , [LOC DHS  ] , [ORG NSC  ] and the [ORG CIA  ] in late April . 
His talking points will be familiar to you: 1 ) [LOC Libya  ] and its regional partners need [LOC U.S.  ] training and equipment to adequately secure its borders and fight transnational terrorism ; and 2 ) [LOC Libya  ] has not been adequately compensated for its decision to give up its WMD programs and abandon terrorism in 2003 . 
He stressed that [LOC Libya  ] is anxious for a [LOC U.S.  ] response to its request to procure lethal and non-lethal military equipment , and for resolution of the eight [MISC C-130s  ] in [LOC Marietta  ] , [LOC Georgia  ] . 
State and [LOC DoD  ] interlocutors urged him to initiate the proposed [MISC Political-Military Dialogue  ] - the first round is provisionally scheduled to take place later this year at the Assistant Secretary-level - and noted that it is the appropriate venue in which to articulate a plan for bilateral military cooperation , to include procurement . 
Your [MISC Libyan  ] interlocutors will be listening for a reaffirmation of a willingness to move the military component of the bilateral relationship forward . 
[ORG SPECIFIC  ] ENGAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES: STANDBY & BORDER FORCES 10 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) While in [LOC Washington  ] , [PER Muatassim  ] again demurred when pressed on [LOC Libya  ] 's potential membership in [ORG TSCTP  ] . 
He argued that the [MISC Tripoli-based  ] ( and [MISC Libyan-controlled  ] ) CEN-SAD already performs [ORG TSCTP  ] 's proposed mission and has the additional benefit of being led by [MISC African  ] countries . 
In your last meeting with him , [PER Muatassim  ] asked for training and technical assistance for the [ORG North Africa Standby Force  ] ( [ORG NASF  ] ) . 
Discussing specifics of proposed [MISC NASF-AFRICOM  ] cooperation and stressing that capacity building is a major component of [ORG TSCTP  ] would be helpful . 
In his meeting with Secretary [PER Clinton  ] , [PER Muatassim  ] characterized [LOC Darfur  ] and the [MISC Chad-Sudan  ] conflict as [LOC Libya  ] 's biggest security threat . 
[LOC Libya  ] 's efforts on [MISC Chad-Sudan  ] include [MISC Libyan  ] command of a 2,000-member border monitoring force ( 1,000 troops from both [LOC Chad  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] ) . 
While results of [LOC Libya  ] 's mediation have been mixed , proposing [ORG AFRICOM  ] cooperation with the force may be an opportunity to demonstrate [ORG AFRICOM  ] 's capacity building focus to a skeptical [MISC Libyan  ] audience . 
An additional issue to raise with [PER Muatassim  ] is proposed [LOC U.S.  ] support for de-mining efforts under [ORG UN  ] auspices . 
TECHNOLOGY & WEAPONS SALES TO [LOC LIBYA  ] 11 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [PER Muatassim  ] raised the issue of the eight [MISC C-130s  ] in [LOC Georgia  ] with State 's Political-Military ( PM ) office . 
PM said the [LOC U.S.  ] would look favorably on requests for new aircraft ( C-130J 's ) , but the [ORG USG  ] position remains that there will be no compensation for the old aircraft and [LOC Libya  ] should work directly with [ORG Lockheed Martin  ] to resolve the matter . 
He inquired about the status of [LOC Libya  ] 's outstanding requests for lethal and non-lethal equipment , warning that [LOC Libya  ] would pursue acquisitions in other foreign markets if the [ORG USG  ] is unable to respond soon . 
State and [LOC DoD  ] have draft responses for many of the items , but some sales will be blocked due to ITAR concerns . 
The Embassy has submitted a draft end-use and transfer agreement to the MFA to enable some of the sales , but training [MISC Libyan  ] procurement officials on [LOC U.S.  ] legal requirements is essential to enable proposed sales .
