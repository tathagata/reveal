<code><pre>UNCLAS [LOC MADRID  ] 001241 SIPDIS SENSITIVE SIPDIS E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: <a href='/tag/PGOV_0.html'>PGOV</a> <a href='/tag/PTER_0.html'>PTER</a> <a href='/tag/SP_0.html'>SP</a> SUBJECT: SPAIN: GOVERNMENT DENIES RUMORED [ORG ETA  ] TALKS <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) On June 19 conservative [MISC Spanish  ] media outlets [ORG ABC  ] and [ORG El Mundo  ] claimed that Deputy Foreign Minister [PER Bernardino Leon  ] participated in negotiations with the [MISC Basque  ] terrorist group [ORG ETA  ] after the group ended its " permanent " cease-fire on June <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
The news reports sparked strong condemnations from the opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] and others who questioned whether the government had broken its promise to end all negotiations with [MISC ETA.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( U ) [PER Leon  ] rejected the allegations on June 20 . 
[MISC Spanish  ] daily [ORG El Pais  ] ( close to the [PER Zapatero  ] government ) reported that " [PER Leon  ] has sharply denied that he participated in meetings with leaders of [ORG ETA  ] on behalf of the government and he has said that the information published by [ORG El Mundo  ] and [ORG ABC  ] was false . 
" According to government sources , neither [PER Leon  ] nor any member of the administration participated in the alleged meetings. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) COMMENT: We do not have independent confirmation of either of these reports . 
We were not aware of any [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] involvement in dealing with [ORG ETA  ] , which is seen here as a domestic issue , and most contact with governments such as [LOC France  ] on the subject have been through police channels . 
[MISC Spanish  ] President [PER Zapatero  ] now needs to appear as tough as possible in dealing with [ORG ETA  ] after the cease-fire rupture and in the face of intense scrutiny and criticism by the opposition . 
He is also on the record with strong comments forswearing future negotiations with the terrorist group . 
[PER Leon  ] is a fairly prominent figure in [MISC Spanish  ] political circles and has not previously , to our knowledge , been involved in [ORG ETA  ] policy-making . 
If the GOS were to re-engage in negotiations with [ORG ETA  ] , it likely would choose a less visible official with previous experience on [ORG ETA  ] .
