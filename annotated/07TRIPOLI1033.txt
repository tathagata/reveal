REASON: 1.4 ( b ) , ( d ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( C ) Summary: Planning for Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] 's upcoming visit to [LOC Spain  ] has been complicated by contradictory [ORG GOL  ] requests for meetings and content . 
After initially saying the Leader did not want to sign bilateral agreements during his visit , the [ORG GOL  ] has reversed course and the two sides are now scrambling to finalize language for a host of memoranda and treaties . 
The [MISC Libyan  ] advance team 's requirements for the Leader 's lodging have prompted speculation about his health . 
End summary . 
LACK OF CLARITY COMPLICATES PLANNING <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Spanish  ] [ORG DCM  ] Rafael-Maria [PER Reig Sanchez  ] told P/E Chief December 9 that planning for Leader [PER Muammar al-Qadhafi  ] 's mid-December visit to [LOC Spain  ] had been problematic in both a logistical and substantive sense . 
[PER Qadhafi  ] originally wanted to visit [LOC Spain  ] before the recent [ORG EU-African Union Summit  ] in [LOC Lisbon  ] ; however , that wound up not being possible for scheduling reasons on both the [MISC Libyan  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] sides . 
It is now expected that [PER Qadhafi  ] will travel to [LOC Spain  ] December 15-18 for a visit comprising both personal and official elements . 
[PER Sanchez  ] noted noted that the [ORG GOL  ] has been unclear and at times contradictory about whether it wishes the visit to be considered official or unofficial. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Confirming press accounts , [PER Sanchez  ] said [PER Qadhafi  ] will meet with [MISC Spanish  ] PM [MISC Zapatero  ] December 17 ; King [PER Juan Carlos  ] is also scheduled to host a luncheon in honor of the visiting [MISC Libyan  ] leader . 
Finalizing protocol arrangements has been " incredibly difficult " , in part because [PER Qadhafi  ] does not encumber an official position or carry official title , and because the [ORG GOL  ] 's advance team -- apparently responding to shifting dictates from its principal -- continues to change its requests for meetings and content . 
[LOC Spain  ] 's Ambassador to [LOC Tripoli  ] , [PER Joaquin Perez-Villanueva  ] , told the [ORG DCM  ] that [PER Qadhafi  ] 's plans to visit [LOC Seville  ] and nearby [MISC Islamic  ] sites in [LOC Cordoba  ] and [LOC Grenada  ] have prompted concern about the nature of the remarks he may deliver at historic [MISC Islamic  ] sites . 
INITIALLY COY , [ORG GOL  ] NOW WANTS TO SIGN BEVY OF AGREEMENTS <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) After initially indicating it did not/not want to sign bilateral agreements during the visit , the [ORG GOL  ] indicated late last week that it wished to quickly finalize language for an education and culture agreement , a defense cooperation agreement , a bilateral legal cooperation and extradition treaty , an investment security agreement and a double taxation-exemption agreement . 
[PER Sanchez  ] expressed frustration about the [ORG GOL  ] 's " wait and hurry up " approach , noting that [LOC Spain  ] had tried for some time to finalize several of the agreements , but to no avail . 
According to [PER Sanchez  ] , the only document for which agreement on the language had been achieved was the education and culture agreement . 
He noted that [ORG GOL  ] officials , referencing the recent denouement of the [MISC Bulgarian  ] medics' case , had been particularly insistent that a bilateral legal cooperation and extradition treaty should preclude the possibility of immediate pardon for prisoners returned to their home country . 
[PER Sanchez  ] lamented that the rush to finalize agreements for signature in time for [PER Qadhafi  ] 's visit had precluded meaningful bilateral discussions of what the two sides' understanding of those accords would mean and how they would be implemented . 
" The form is more important to the [ORG GOL  ] than the substance " , he said . 
LODGING REQUESTS PROMPT SPECULATION ABOUT QADHAFI'S HEALTH <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Sanchez  ] noted that [PER Qadhafi  ] 's lodging requirements were also problematic . 
[ORG GOL  ] officials insisted that the Leader not be housed above the first floor of the hotel in which he will stay , saying [PER Qadhafi  ] refuses to ride in elevators because of security considerations . 
In addition , [ORG GOL  ] minders insisted that the hotel and room in which [PER Qadhafi  ] will stay should feature as few stairs as possible . 
[PER Sanchez  ] said that [ORG GOL  ] officials , when pressed , conceded that [PER Qadhafi  ] has difficulty physically negotiating stairs ( NFI ) . 
( [ORG Note: Post  ] notes that [PER Qadhafi  ] appeared to be unwell in television footage of [LOC Lisbon  ] 's [LOC TRIPOLI  ] 00001033 002 OF 002 [ORG EU-African Union Summit  ] . 
His gait was unsteady and he appeared to have difficulty turning his head , forcing him to turn his entire upper torso . 
There have been recent , unconfirmed reports that he may have suffered a stroke . 
End note . 
) <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment: Madrid 's frustration with [PER Qadhafi  ] 's advance team and the Leader 's vascillating druthers echoe what we 've heard from our [MISC French  ] counterparts here regarding trip coordination for the [LOC Paris  ] stop . 
The focus on securing a raft of bilateral agreements , regardless of content , is consistent with the [ORG GOL  ] 's desire for demonstrable symbols of [LOC Libya  ] 's re-integration into the international community . 
End comment .
