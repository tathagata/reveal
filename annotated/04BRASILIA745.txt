( C ) Summary and Introduction: As a result of [ORG Article  ] 98 sanctions , [LOC Brazil  ] 's [ORG MOD  ] is shifting to other countries for training and exchanges previously done with the [LOC U.S.  ] -- a drop-off clearly evident to this Mission . 
Many in the [MISC Brazilian  ] military -- including Defense Minister [PER Viegas  ] himself -- consider this development unfortunate and want to reinvigorate bilateral mil-mil ties , particularly leading up to [LOC Brazil  ] 's upcoming peacekeeping effort in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
Indeed , Defense Minister [PER Viegas  ] recently told the Ambassador that he views [LOC Brazil  ] 's participation in [LOC Haiti  ] as an opportunity to try to bolster the [MISC Brazil-U.S.  ] military relationship ( Ref A ) . 
But the transfer of funds to pay course/exchange costs and particularly full FMS pricing is unacceptable for [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Unfortunately , a reversal of the decline in training and exchanges with the [LOC U.S.  ] is unlikely ; [LOC Brazil  ] remains opposed to signing an [ORG Article  ] 98 accord . 
End Summary <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Prior to the imposition of [ORG Article  ] 98 sanctions on July 1 , 2003 , the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] ( [ORG MOD  ] ) leadership warned that it would seek military training and exchange opportunities elsewhere if this were done and [LOC Brazil  ] was subject to paying full FMS course costs for military training . 
Almost nine months later , the [ORG MOD  ] has indeed shifted most of its training away from [LOC U.S.  ] military institutions . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] military leaders assert that [ORG MOD  ] has done so without reducing the overall level of overseas training opportunities available to its officers. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) As expected , other countries have offered [ORG MOD  ] training programs to replace those previously conducted at [LOC U.S.  ] institutions . 
While [LOC France  ] and the [LOC United Kingdom  ] have picked up much of the slack , [MISC Brazilian  ] officers , according to military sources , are now being sent also to training programs in [LOC China  ] , [LOC India  ] , and [LOC South Africa.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) A brief survey reveals that a severe drop off in [LOC U.S.  ] training and exchanges has already occurred . 
The [ORG Navy  ] plans to send only three officers to the [LOC U.S.  ] in 2005 , including two pilots for two-year flight training that [ORG MOD  ] " would have paid for anyway " according to [ORG Navy  ] sources . 
When a decision on purchase of [LOC Brazil  ] 's next generation fighter jet , the [MISC F-X  ] , is finally taken , training for pilots will likely be in the country of origin of the new aircraft ; this further prejudices the already limited prospects for the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC F-X  ] competitor , [PER Lockheed Martin  ] 's [MISC F-16  ] . 
The [ORG Army  ] has also sliced the number of officers being sent to [LOC U.S.  ] schools for training and exchanges . 
The [ORG Army  ] command 's 2004 list of visits and other activities in the [LOC U.S.  ] shows only one program as long as one month -- a program carried on the [ORG Army  ] list as " no cost . 
" <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Army  ] staff officers are emphatic that they continue to want strong ties with the [LOC U.S.  ] , and senior officers appear ready to switch back to the [LOC U.S.  ] if full [ORG IMET  ] funding were restored in the future . 
Some senior [MISC Brazilian  ] military officers go further and believe [LOC Brazil  ] should bear the full costs for friendly nation military exchanges in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Thus , they argue , reciprocal treatment should be granted [MISC Brazilian  ] officers attending such exchange courses elsewhere . 
Some of [LOC Brazil  ] 's new mil-mil exchanges are based on this formula. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Comment: Given the military 's wounded pride and the now high costs of training in the [LOC United States  ] , it is doubtful the sharp decline in training and exchanges with the [LOC U.S.  ] will be reversed anytime soon . 
Despite the loss of valued [LOC U.S.  ] training and exchanges , neither the [ORG MOD  ] nor the [ORG GOB  ] shows any sign of softening its opposition in principle to signing an [ORG Article  ] 98 Agreement with us . 
As [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] training links weaken , so too , inevitably , will the traditionally close ties between our two armed forces .
