Summary ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [LOC S/NF  ] ) The emergence of a new [MISC Bosniak  ] party , led by the powerful , reportedly corrupt , and sometimes vindictive media mogul [PER Fahrudin Radoncic  ] , is likely to create further rifts in the [MISC Bosniak  ] political scene , particularly amid the campaign for the October 2010 general elections . 
[PER Radoncic  ] has the support of the leader of the [MISC Islamic  ] community . 
Also , [PER Radoncic  ] 's ownership and direct control of the most widely-read daily newspaper in [LOC Bosnia  ] will ensure that his campaign message is well propagated . 
[PER Radoncic  ] 's reputation for questionable business ventures with partners from across the political spectrum , combined with his likely desire for influence over the judiciary to escape prosecution for corruption , suggests that he will seek political alliances based on lucrative personal prospects , rather than ideology or even ethnic affiliation . 
Although it is too early to make concrete predictions , [PER Radoncic  ] 's party is poised to capture votes primarily from [PER Haris Silajdzic  ] 's Party for [ORG BiH  ] ( [ORG SBiH  ] ) , as well as a wide swath of apathetic voters allured by his pledges to fix the economy . 
End summary . 
The [ORG Man  ] , the Legend ------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [PER Fahrudin Radoncic  ] rose from relative poverty and obscurity after the 1992-95 [ORG BiH  ] war to become the founder and owner of [LOC Bosnia  ] 's leading publishing company , [ORG Avaz Publishing  ] . 
This company is known especially for its production of the country 's highest-circulation daily newspaper , [ORG Dnevni Avaz  ] , but also for a small television news show and a number of widely-read magazines , such as Global . 
The success of [ORG Avaz  ] has given [PER Radoncic  ] significant control of the [MISC Bosniak  ] media . 
[ORG Avaz  ] therefore has proven a powerful tool against [PER Radoncic  ] 's opponents , particularly the police authorities investigating his role in corruption scandals . 
Although not a veteran politician himself , [PER Radoncic  ] through [ORG Avaz  ] has played an active role in politics for over a decade , with [MISC Bosniak  ] political candidates vying for his media support . 
Candidates whom [ORG Avaz  ] endorses for the [MISC Bosniak  ] member of the Tri-Presidency -- most recently , Party for [ORG BiH  ] ( [ORG SBiH  ] ) chairman [PER Haris Silajdzic  ] in 2006 -- usually succeed in elections . 
[PER Radoncic  ] also cultivates wide international ties , and [PER Sead Numanovic  ] , editor-in-chief of [ORG Avaz  ] , is one of the most well-connected people in [LOC Bosnia  ] . 
The Scandals ------------ <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( S/NF ) [PER Radoncic  ] is widely believed to be responsible for corrupt business practices , most notably his role in a scandal involving the [ORG Federation Development Bank  ] ( [ORG FDB  ] ) ( ref A ) . 
[PER Radoncic  ] admitted to having hired [PER Ramiz Dzaferovic  ] -- [ORG SDA  ] member , director of the [ORG FDB  ] -- to conduct an audit of [ORG Avaz  ] through [PER Dzaferovic  ] 's personal audit company . 
At the same time , [PER Dzaferovic  ] through the [ORG FDB  ] gave [PER Radoncic  ] a loan of [MISC KM  ] 22.5 million -- which the [ORG FDB  ] had allocated for agriculture -- for the construction of [PER Radoncic  ] 's [ORG Avaz Tower  ] in [LOC Sarajevo  ] . 
Separately , local media recently reported alleged ties between [PER Radoncic  ] and international drug dealer [MISC Kelmendi  ] , which led [PER Radoncic  ] to launch a full-scale attack in the pages of [ORG Avaz  ] against the police officials working on that case . 
Also , staff of the Office of the High Representative ( [ORG OHR  ] ) recently linked [PER Radoncic  ] to an international money laundering scheme . 
This allegation , which was leaked to the press , sparked a smear campaign in [ORG Avaz  ] against the Principal Deputy High Representative , a [ORG State Department  ] employee on detail to [ORG OHR  ] , somewhat belying [PER Radoncic  ] 's claims that one of his priorities will be to [LOC SARAJEVO  ] 00000134 002 OF 004 cooperate with the international community . 
The Entree into Politics ------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) In September 2009 , [PER Radoncic  ] launched a new [MISC Bosniak  ] political party , the Alliance for a [ORG Better Future of BiH  ] ( [ORG SBB-BiH  ] ) ( ref B ) . 
[PER Radoncic  ] is almost certainly seeking political status in order to secure protection from the investigation of his illegal business deals by wielding government influence over the judiciary . 
Moreover , now may be a personally appealing time for [PER Radoncic  ] to enter politics , as media outlets besides [ORG Avaz  ] indicate that [PER Radoncic  ] 's business is struggling and that [ORG Avaz  ] 's chief rival daily newspaper , [ORG Oslobodjenje  ] , is rapidly catching up to [ORG Avaz  ] in its sales . 
This suggests that the pragmatic [PER Radoncic  ] is entering the political scene to seek lucrative deals wherever he can find them , rather than choosing partners based on ideology or even ethnic affiliation . 
This approach would make him an appealing ally for [LOC Republika Srpska  ] ( [LOC RS  ] ) Prime Minister [PER Milorad Dodik  ] , who also dabbles in business and is himself under investigation for corruption . 
[PER Dodik  ] therefore may see [PER Radoncic  ] as his ideal [MISC Bosniak  ] interlocutor . 
Indeed , [PER Radoncic  ] told the [ORG DCM  ] in January that he has met with [PER Dodik  ] , as well as [ORG Croatian Democratic Union  ] ( [ORG HDZ  ] ) -BiH President [PER Dragan Covic  ] -- who has been indicted for corruption and is forging a closer relationship with [PER Dodik  ] ( septel ) -- and has a good relationship with both men . 
Moreover , the fact that [ORG Avaz  ] has kept mostly quiet on the very issue that it could use to galvanize the [MISC Bosniak  ] populace ahead of the election -- rhetoric on a referendum in the [LOC RS  ] -- has led to speculation that discussions on a partnership between [PER Dodik  ] and [PER Radoncic  ] may already be underway . 
The [MISC Setbacks  ] ------------ <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S/NF ) Despite any possible musings of a deal with [PER Dodik  ] , [ORG SBB-BiH  ] appears to be off to a rocky start . 
Initial polls suggest that the party has a small following , and [PER Radoncic  ] has yet to attract any well-known personalities to join his party . 
His most notable party member besides himself is former state-level PM and former [ORG SDA  ] member [PER Adnan Terzic  ] , although [PER Terzic  ] 's following within [ORG SDA  ] was tenuous at best when he left the party . 
The other big name in [ORG SBB-BiH  ] is [PER Haris Basic  ] , a former [ORG SDA  ] member whom the [ORG Council of Ministers  ] suspended as director of the [ORG Foreign Investment Promotion Agency  ] ( [ORG FIPA  ] ) due to the [ORG BiH Court  ] 's indictment against him for illegally issuing transport licenses . 
[PER Radoncic  ] also has not yet managed to form a founding party congress despite the high attendance at his kickoff rallies in [LOC Sarajevo  ] , [LOC Tuzla  ] , [LOC Zenica  ] , and elsewhere . 
Also , [PER Radoncic  ] -- whose family is rom the [LOC Sandzak  ] region in [LOC Serbia  ] -- carries a stong " [LOC Sandzak  ] " accent when he speaks , which is anathma to many [MISC Bosnians  ] . 
Moreover , he lacks persona charisma and is generally uncomfortable and awkard with interlocutors who are unfamiliar to him . 
The Weapons ----------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( S/NF ) Despite these initial setbacks , [PER Radoncic  ] 's expectations for electoral success are high . 
Through public hearings conducted by the [ORG BiH  ] parliamentary working group on changes to the election law , [PER Radoncic  ] in January proposed an increase in the threshold for a party 's representation in Parliament from three to five percent at the state and entity level . 
The parliamentary working group on changes to the election law rejected his proposal . 
[PER Radoncic  ] 's most powerful weapon during the elections will be [ORG Avaz  ] , and he already is using it as an advertising venue for his party . 
The economy , a major concern for [MISC Bosniak  ] voters , is one of [ORG Avaz  ] 's key pre-election themes , as well as the incompetence of [ORG BiH  ] 's current leadership , particularly [MISC Bosniak  ] tri-Presidency member [PER Haris Silajdzic  ] . 
Amid the country-wide economic crisis , these messages may well resonate with apathetic [MISC Bosniak  ] voters . 
Indeed , [PER Terzic  ] told the [ORG DCM  ] that this is one of [ORG SBB-BiH  ] 's key target groups in the election campaign . 
The [ORG SBiH Political Vacuum  ] ------------------------- [LOC SARAJEVO  ] 00000134 003 OF 004 <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Radoncic  ] 's entree into the [MISC Bosniak  ] political scene will most likely come at the expense of the deteriorating [ORG SBiH  ] . 
[ORG SBiH  ] garnered poor results in the 2008 municipal elections , and our [ORG SBiH  ] contacts continue to tell us of the disgruntlement within the party with [PER Silajdzic  ] 's poor leadership . 
[PER Bakir Izetbegovic  ] , who is a friend of [PER Silajdzic  ] , has suggested to us that [PER Silajdzic  ] may in fact be preparing to leave the political scene . 
Moreover , the [MISC Islamic  ] community , which had previously endorsed [PER Silajdzic  ] , now supports [PER Radoncic  ] at the expense of [ORG SBiH  ] . 
[ORG Avaz  ] consistently maligns [PER Silajdzic  ] , calling him a " lying President " and a " mafia godfather " who steals from the poor . 
[PER Radoncic  ] also is seeking to fill [PER Silajdzic  ] 's self-proclaimed role as the key [MISC Bosniak  ] interlocutor with the [ORG USG  ] . 
For example , his visit to [LOC Washington  ] in February to attend the prayer breakfast , as well as his speech at the [ORG U.S. Institute of Peace  ] , received widespread press throughout [ORG BiH  ] , dwarfing that of the other [ORG BiH  ] attendees . 
The Boost from the [ORG Islamic Community  ] ------------------------------------ <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( S/NF ) [PER Silajdzic  ] 's victory in the 2006 presidential race stemmed from the same sources [PER Radoncic  ] has at his disposal -- [ORG Dnevni Avaz  ] and [MISC Islamic  ] community head [PER Reis-ul-ulema Mustafa Ceric  ] , whom [ORG Avaz  ] quoted almost daily in the run-up to the 2006 elections and who was seen with [PER Silajdzic  ] at a number of important [MISC Islamic  ] events ( ref C ) . 
Although [PER Radoncic  ] is not at all devout , he and [PER Reis Ceric  ] have enjoyed a close relationship for over a year , most likely tied to [PER Radoncic  ] 's gift of one million KM ( approximately 714,000 USD ) for the construction of the [PER Reis  ] 's headquarters and residence in [LOC Sarajevo  ] . 
Additionally , [PER Reis Ceric  ] is the only public figure whom [ORG Avaz  ] has never criticized . 
[ORG Avaz  ] regularly features the [PER Reis  ] on the front page , reports on his travels , and mocks media outlets that criticize him . 
[ORG Avaz  ] even posited a " different interpretation " of the conviction in February 2009 of an imam in [LOC Travnik  ] on charges of pedophilia ( ref D ) . 
[PER Radoncic  ] openly echoes the [PER Reis  ] 's outcry against " [MISC Islamophobia  ] " ( ref E ) , most recently attacking former editor-in-chief of [ORG Federation TV  ] ( [ORG FTV  ] ) [PER Duska Jurisic  ] , who reported on [PER Radoncic  ] 's role in the [ORG FDB  ] scandal . 
[PER Radoncic  ] stated that " we cannot permit a person who is not [MISC Muslim  ] to be an editor in our [MISC Islamic  ] community . 
" Any overt endorsements by [PER Reis Ceric  ] of [PER Radoncic  ] 's party would give [PER Radoncic  ] a boost among religious voters who see [PER Tihic  ] as overly secular ; conversely , [PER Radoncic  ] can revel in his irreverent understanding of [MISC Islam  ] if he so chooses . 
[ORG SDA  ] Deputy President [PER Asim Sarajlic  ] told us that he overheard the [PER Reis  ] tell [PER Radoncic  ] at a reception , " People need to see you at mosque , " to which [PER Radoncic  ] allegedly replied , " But [PER Reis  ] , I don't know any prayers ! 
" Later , in a theatrical aside during a lunch with [ORG DCM  ] , [PER Radoncic  ] held his wine glass aloft and said " I can't support radical [MISC Islam:  ] I would be their first victim ! 
" The [MISC Hurdle:  ] [ORG SDA  ] --------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) Although it is too early to make concrete predictions , at this point it seems that even with the support of the [MISC Islamic  ] community , [PER Radoncic  ] will be unlikely to make great gains in these elections at the expense of [ORG SDA  ] . 
[ORG SDA  ] has a well-established voting base , particularly in rural and semi-urban areas . 
[PER Bosniaks  ] considered [ORG SDA  ] and its first President , [PER Alija Izetbegovic  ] , the protectors of their people during the war , and the limited success of splinter parties like [ORG SBiH  ] in recent elections suggests that [PER Bosniaks  ] choose established parties over charismatic new leaders when they feel threatened ( ref F ) . 
Even with [ORG SBiH  ] 's [MISC Tri-Presidency  ] victory in 2006 , [ORG SDA  ] remained the largest [MISC Bosniak  ] party , capturing more seats in both [ORG Federation  ] and state legislatures than [ORG SBiH  ] . 
Moreover , although [PER Radoncic  ] wields significant media power , he relies on [ORG SDA  ] for financial support , due to [ORG SDA  ] 's connections with the [ORG FDB  ] . 
[ORG Avaz  ] treats [PER Tihic  ] with caution -- including by sidelining [PER Tihic  ] 's repeated , direct attacks on [PER Radoncic  ] -- suggesting that [PER Radoncic  ] recognizes the risk in burning bridges with the most powerful [MISC Bosniak  ] party . 
[LOC SARAJEVO  ] 00000134 004 OF 004 The [ORG Impact: Fractious Bosniak Politics  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( S/NF ) Although [PER Radoncic  ] treads carefully with [ORG SDA  ] , he bears a longstanding animosity with the other major [MISC Federation-based  ] party , the [ORG Social Democratic Party  ] ( [ORG SDP  ] ) , stemming largely from his personal dislike of party President [PER Zlatko Lagumdzija  ] . 
However , [PER Radoncic  ] -- genuinely shocking [ORG Avaz  ] editor [ORG Numanovic  ] , who was also present -- told the [ORG DCM  ] in January that he had recently met with [PER Lagumdzija  ] for over two hours to discuss a possible post-election coalition , which he may see as a means of sidelining [ORG SDA  ] . 
Nonetheless , [ORG Avaz  ] 's consistent disparaging of [PER Lagumdzija  ] and [PER Silajdzic  ] -- as well as [PER Radoncic  ] 's ties to the [PER Reis  ] , who also is on the outs with both men -- makes it less likely that either party will want to work with [PER Radoncic  ] before or after the elections . 
These inflammatory comments are likely to increase as the year progresses , which will contribute to a [MISC Bosniak  ] campaign that may well be based more on personal attacks than on any potentially unifying issue . 
A strong showing for [PER Radoncic  ] in the elections would put him in a position to negotiate a place in a post-election coalition . 
Even if [PER Radoncic  ] serves in opposition , he will become one more strong personality in [MISC Bosniak  ] politics that could undermine initiatives from moderate [MISC Bosniak  ] parties . 
Moreover , [PER Radoncic  ] is powerful , due to his business ties and the strong influence of [ORG Avaz  ] . 
He may be able to seriously damage any party inside or outside the coalition that challenges him . 
As the economic crisis shows no signs of abating , [PER Radoncic  ] could become a greater force , given the hide-bound lethargy and backward-looking politics of many of his [MISC Bosniak  ] opponents . 
Comment ------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( S/NF ) The collapse of the [LOC Prud  ] process ( ref G ) , the political and economic woes in the [ORG Federation  ] ( ref H ) , and the battle over the mayor of [LOC Mostar  ] ( ref I ) are recent examples of the extent to which fractious [MISC Bosniak  ] politics contribute to paralysis at the state and [ORG Federation  ] level . 
[PER Tihic  ] 's attempts to shore up the state have been held in check by opposition on his right flank -- [PER Silajdzic  ] , the [MISC Islamic  ] community , and even [PER Lagumdzija  ] , who sees it as his duty as opposition leader to oppose any initiative the ruling coalition supports . 
If [PER Radoncic  ] succeeds in establishing a foothold in a new government , [PER Tihic  ] will face a more difficult battle in securing a unified [MISC Bosniak  ] response to anti-state behavior from the [MISC RS  ] and in taking a constructive approach to such initiatives as constitutional reform . 
Moreover , an alliance between [PER Radoncic  ] and [PER Dodik  ] , perceived as two of the country 's more corrupt leaders , would send a very discouraging message to those in [LOC Bosnia  ] and [LOC Herzegovina  ] who are seeking the rule of law , especially the [MISC Bosniak  ] intellectual elite . 
Comment Cont 'd -------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( S/NF ) At the same time -- however distasteful it may be to us or others -- if [PER Radoncic  ] and gains enough authority through the October 2010 elections to join a ruling coalition at the state or [ORG Federation  ] level , his comparative lack of discord with [MISC RS  ] leaders and pragmatic approach on issues ranging from economic development to constitutional reform and [MISC Euro-Atlantic  ] integration could perhaps contribute to a more peaceful political situation in [LOC Bosnia  ] and [LOC Herzegovina  ] over the near term .
