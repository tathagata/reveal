End Summary . 
[ORG Task Force Helmand Briefing  ] for [PER Biden  ] and [PER Graham  ] --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) The [LOC UK  ] leadership briefing was somber . 
Senior [ORG Civilian Advisor Hugh Powell  ] noted the [LOC UK  ] had only 4000 troops in [LOC Afghanistan’s  ] largest province , equaling one-third the troop density of [LOC RC East  ] . 
[MISC British  ] troops were covering the bulk of the population centers , but [PER Powell  ] noted that , given stretched resources , the [MISC British  ] were aiming for “good enough.” ( This is a phrase that is being used more often by the [LOC UK  ] civilian and military leadership . 
) [ORG BG Messenger  ] explained that his forces and the [ORG Afghan National Army  ] were largely fixed to their [ORG Forward Operating Bases and PBs.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Powell  ] raised the issue of building governance and [PER Biden  ] broke in to press [PER Powell  ] on what “building governance” meant in practical terms . 
[PER Powell  ] described governance as having a few key people in the right places . 
[PER Biden  ] asked for more specifics about what was needed . 
[PER Powell  ] made a strong pitch for a unified command of the police mentors under [MISC CSTC-A  ] . 
[PER Biden  ] asked where these mentors would come from and [PER Powell  ] suggested that non-troop contributing countries could provide them. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Graham  ] asked attendees for a definition of success ( in establishing greater security ) . 
[ORG BG Messenger  ] defined coverage of more area as a key element of success . 
[ORG COMISAF  ] and [LOC RC-S MG de Kruif  ] added that [ORG Afghan National Security Forces  ] ( [ORG ANSF  ] ) control of [LOC Afghanistan’s  ] large cities - even in unstable provinces - is now the norm . 
[PER Mangal  ] Presentation to [PER Biden  ] and [PER Graham  ] --------------------------------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Governor [PER Mangal  ] , accompanied by [ORG Afghan National Army  ] ( [ORG ANA  ] ) General [PER Mohaidan  ] and [ORG Helmand Police  ] Chief [PER Colonel Shirzad  ] , briefed the visiting officials on his efforts to combat terrorism , corruption and narcotics in [LOC Helmand  ] . 
He welcomed increased support from the [LOC U.S.  ] , and described significant progress in [LOC Helmand  ] , noting eight out 13 districts were now under government control . 
However , [PER Mangal  ] quickly added there was still much to do to improve security in the province . 
Even in the eight districts under [MISC GIRoA  ] control , the security footprint was far too small ; more forces could expand the security zones around the cities to allow communities room to promote commerce and civil engagement . 
[PER Mangal  ] observed there was still no presence in [LOC Baghran  ] and [LOC Vashir  ] in northern [LOC Helmand  ] or in [LOC Kanashin  ] or [LOC Dishu  ] in the south. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) The Governor made clear his view that [LOC U.S.  ] forces are urgently needed . 
New forces should help secure the open border with [LOC Pakistan  ] , while the capabilities of the [ORG ANSF  ] could be strengthened to support any mission . 
He praised the work of the [ORG ANA  ] and [ORG Afghan National Police  ] ( [ORG ANP  ] ) and said that with additional help they would take on more missions . 
He noted that the October attack against [LOC Lashkar Gah  ] was repulsed by the [ORG ANSF  ] , well supported by ISAF forces . 
Coordination between these security forces was excellent and he expressed full confidence the [LOC U.S.  ] forces would work well with Helmand’s [ORG ANSF  ] leadership. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Thanking [PER Mangal  ] for his efforts and praising his hard work , [PER Biden  ] then discussed President-Elect Obama’s desire to establish “a new contract” with [LOC Afghanistan  ] , a message [PER Biden  ] had already shared with President [PER Karzai  ] ( Ref A ) . 
[PER Biden  ] [LOC KABUL  ] 00000140 002 OF 003 stressed the importance of improved governance by the central government and the need for increased capacity in the [ORG ANSF  ] ; international forces alone could not bring security and prosperity to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] was prepared to increase assistance and would sustain existing commitments , but the [MISC GIRoA  ] needed to actively tackle corruption and support more effective governors and military leaders - like [PER Mangal  ] and [ORG Mohaidan.  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Biden  ] continued , saying the [LOC U.S.  ] government was committed to long-term support for [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
He cautioned , however , that if the [MISC Afghan  ] government failed to effectively address key problems , such as poor governance , poppy cultivation , and corruption , it would be difficult to retain the strong [LOC U.S.  ] public support necessary to continue large-scale assistance to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Mangal Calls  ] for Extension of “Garmsir Model” --------------------------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) While the [ORG Helmand Task Force  ] briefed [PER Biden  ] and [PER Graham  ] , Governor [PER Mangal  ] met with the Ambassador and [PER BG Nicholson  ] . 
The Ambassador thanked the Governor for his hard work and congratulated him on the large [ORG Counter Narcotics Shura  ] he conducted January 4 in [LOC Lashkar Gah  ] . 
[PER Mangal  ] stressed he was fully engaged in improving security , fighting corruption and building the capacity of the [MISC Afghan  ] security forces . 
He was confident incoming [LOC U.S.  ] forces would be able to achieve progress in extending security in north and south [LOC Helmand.  ] <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Raising concerns regarding the [LOC UK  ] security strategy , [PER Mangal  ] described his disappointment during a recent visit to [LOC Sangin  ] . 
He noted that the bazaar in central [LOC Sangin  ] was still outside the security zone ; the situation in [LOC Kajaki  ] was much the same. “I do not have anything against them ( the [MISC British  ] ) but they must leave their bases and engage with the people.” He said even in [LOC Nad Ali  ] the area of control was still too small. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) The Ambassador asked if the problem in [LOC Sangin  ] was rooted in the civilian or military approach . 
[PER Mangal  ] said he thought both elements were at fault because there was “neither development and nor security” for the town . 
[PER Mangal  ] explained that the approach of the [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Marines  ] in [LOC Garmsir  ] was the right model for promoting community security in [LOC Helmand  ] . 
The forces had remained in place for enough time to allow the bazaar , schools and clinics to reopen and then they planned a successful handover to ensure the new security zone could be maintained by the [LOC UK  ] and the [ORG ANSF  ] . 
Unfortunately , the [LOC UK  ] has not built on the [LOC U.S.  ] achievement by expanding the security zone around [LOC Garmsir  ] still further. <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) [PER Mangal  ] said he had told the [LOC UK  ] team that even if they brought in thousands of additional troops , they would need a new plan and a shift of focus to connect to the people . 
As in [LOC Garmsir  ] , success lay in clearing a large enough area around the town to encompass the bazaar , establishing visible reconstruction and development projects and engaging directly and often with local residents. <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( C ) The Ambassador thanked the Governor for his detailed and frank assessment , agreeing the situation posed a serious challenge . 
He said the [LOC UK  ] was working well with the [LOC U.S.  ] and that he was confident the [MISC British  ] shared our vision for the region . 
Now , we must emphasize to them that the bazaar equals the city and the city equals hope - together this represents [LOC Afghanistan  ] delivering security and economic development to its people . 
[PER Mangal:  ] Promoting Successful Communities and Undermining [ORG SMA  ] --------------------------------------------- --------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( C ) The Governor appreciated the chance to share key concerns with Ambassador and [PER BG Nicholson  ] . 
The Governor is a skilled politician and clearly had no intention of embarrassing the [LOC UK  ] leadership , but wanted to highlight the [LOC Garmsir  ] model as the right formula for [LOC Helmand  ] . 
His focus on [LOC Sangin  ] also has a strong political element . 
If he can successfully move [LOC Sangin  ] into a “Garmsir Model , ” he knows opposition strongman Sher [PER Muhammad Akhundzada  ] ( [ORG SMA  ] ) will be weakened and some [LOC Alizai  ] may move away from his camp . 
Progress in [LOC Sangin  ] would be a preemptive political strike against [ORG SMA  ] . 
This will become more important as poppy eradication kicks off and efforts are launched against narco facilities in the upper [LOC Sangin Valley  ] .
