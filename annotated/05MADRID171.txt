Summary . 
The [ORG Zapatero Government  ] has undertaken a series of gestures intended to signal their desire for improved ties with the [ORG USG  ] . 
[LOC Spain  ] will contribute $20 million to the [ORG UNDP  ] to support the [LOC Iraq  ] elections , met a [ORG USG  ] request to press [MISC Arab  ] governments to encourage [MISC Sunni  ] participation in the [LOC Iraq  ] elections , and used a speech by King [PER Juan Carlos  ] to underscore the importance to [LOC Spain  ] of good bilateral ties with the [LOC U.S.  ] A senior [ORG MFA  ] official told Charge [LOC Spain  ] " wants back in " with the [ORG USG  ] . 
We have acknowledged the positive gestures while urging [LOC Spain  ] to do more , for example by leading a PRT in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
We have also asked [ORG GOS  ] and Socialist leaders to rein in unhelpful comments about Coalition operations in [LOC Iraq.  ] <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) After months of encouraging such positive steps by the [ORG GOS  ] , we appear to be closer to a turning point with the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] . 
[ORG MFA  ] and [LOC Moncloa  ] representatives have gone to great lengths to ensure that we are taking note of their positive actions on issues such as [LOC Iraq  ] . 
While not supportive of the [ORG USG  ] mission , [ORG GOS  ] officials are clearly aware that it is more productive to contribute to [LOC Iraq  ] 's reconstruction than to reiterate their opposition to the war itself . 
They are clearly extending their hand to us and we believe it is important that we both acknowledge the positive [MISC Spanish  ] gestures and encourage further positive measures on the part of the [ORG GOS  ] , for example by leading a PRT in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and/or providing training for [MISC Iraqi  ] security personnel in [LOC Spain  ] . 
At the very least , we should take advantage of their current interest in repairing ties with us to accomplish key [ORG USG  ] objectives in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
End Summary. //POSITIVE GESTURES ON IRAQ// <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [LOC Spain  ] will provide $20 million to support the [LOC Iraq  ] elections , according to [ORG National Security Adviser  ] [PER Carles Casajuana  ] . 
Poloff had provided [MISC REF A  ] points to Deputy Director General for the [LOC Near East  ] [PER Alberto Moreno  ] on 1/3 and urged [LOC Spain  ] to support the [LOC International Mission  ] for [LOC Iraq  ] Elections ( [ORG IMIE  ] ) . 
[PER Moreno  ] said he would study the paper and respond soon . 
We subsequently learned that at the time the [MISC REF A  ] points were delivered , the [ORG GOS  ] was nearing the end of a long internal debate on whether to provide assistance for the [LOC Iraq  ] elections , though not through the [ORG IMIE  ] . 
We were informed of the positive decision by [ORG MFA  ] Deputy Director General for Foreign Policy [PER Felix Costales  ] , who provided poloff a 1/10 clipping from the [MISC Spanish  ] news agency [ORG EFE  ] describing the [ORG GOS  ] assistance to the [LOC Iraq  ] elections through the [ORG UNDP  ] and said he hoped the [ORG USG  ] would take positive note of the [ORG GOS  ] contribution ( SEE REF B ) . 
The comments were attributed to an unnamed [ORG GOS  ] official and drew no local news coverage , a fact that did not disappoint [PER Casajuana  ] given the political sensitivity of any [ORG GOS  ] involvement in [LOC Iraq.  ] <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Costales  ] noted that , at the [ORG USG  ] 's request , [LOC Spain  ] had also engaged [MISC Arab  ] countries to urge them to press [MISC Iraqi  ] Sunnis to participate in the elections . 
Most importantly , he said , [LOC Spain  ] had demarched [MISC Syrian  ] authorities , requesting that they explain to [MISC Iraqi Sunni  ] leaders the potential long term cost to them of refusing to participate in a process that most of the international community will endorse. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Charge contacted [PER Casajuana  ] on 1/11 to congratulate the [ORG GOS  ] on the contribution . 
[PER Casajuana  ] said the [ORG GOS  ] supported the January 30 elections because , difficult as the process may be , the increased legitimacy of the new [MISC Iraqi  ] authorities would likely lead to improved security conditions for the [MISC Iraqi  ] people . 
The sensitivity of the matter for the [ORG GOS  ] was underscored when the local daily " [ORG El Mundo  ] " cited an [ORG MFA  ] source as denying a report that the [MISC Spanish  ] contribution had been made in order to help repair relations with the [MISC USG.  ] <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) According to [PER Costales  ] , the [ORG GOS  ] funds came from [LOC Spain  ] 's $300 million pledge made during the [LOC Iraq  ] Donors Conference and were provide to [ORG UNDP  ] in support of the electoral process . 
In 2004-2005 , [LOC Spain  ] disbursed $160 million of these funds . 
[PER Costales  ] said the [ORG GOS  ] had not yet determined how best to channel the remaining $140 million [MISC Spanish  ] aid , but wanted to demonstrate its commitment to help rebuild [LOC Iraq  ] . 
( [MISC NOTE: A  ] 1/12 news report indicated the remaining [MISC Spanish  ] aid to [LOC Iraq  ] will primarily be in the form of soft loans . 
END NOTE ) . <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Poloff spoke with Deputy Director General for the [LOC Near East  ] [PER Alberto Moreno  ] on 1/12 to learn more about the debate and the [ORG GOS  ] contribution . 
[PER Moreno  ] said [MISC Spanish  ] officials were torn between " funding an election that would take place under difficult conditions " or directing such aid where it would " do more to improve humanitarian conditions . 
" [PER Moreno  ] said that he and others in the [LOC Near East  ] Directorate believed that there was no option other than to proceed with elections as soon as possible . 
" The only hope is that the next [MISC Iraqi  ] government will enjoy greater legitimacy than the current authorities and will therefore be able to improve security conditions . 
" Asked about the [ORG GOS  ] approach to [MISC Arab  ] countries to encourage [MISC Sunni  ] participation , [PER Moreno  ] said that [LOC Spain  ] was happy to help when asked , but that he did not believe the [ORG GOS  ] had managed to move those governments to action . 
[PER Moreno  ] said he hoped both gestures would help mend bilateral relations . 
Poloff assured him that the [ORG USG  ] was appreciative of these steps by [LOC Spain.  ] //THE KING LAUDS IMPORTANCE OF [MISC U.S.-SPAIN TIES//  ] <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) During a 1/13 Royal reception for the [LOC Madrid  ] diplomatic corps , King [PER Juan Carlos  ] declared that bilateral relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] represented a " fundamental point of reference " for [MISC Spanish  ] foreign policy . 
He added that one of [LOC Spain  ] 's primary objectives was to " develop improved bilateral ties with the [LOC U.S.  ] at every level . 
" //MFA: " WE WANT BACK IN " WITH THE USG// <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [ORG MFA  ] Director General for Foreign Policy ( P equivalent ) [PER Rafael Dezcallar  ] approached Charge following the King 's speech to inform him that the [ORG MFA  ] had drafted that portion of the King 's speech . 
[PER Dezcallar  ] also pointed to [LOC Spain  ] 's $20 million contribution to the [LOC Iraq  ] elections as another gesture of goodwill and willingness to cooperate with the [ORG USG  ] on an issue important to us . 
" We wanted to send clear signals that we want back in " with the [ORG USG  ] . 
( [MISC NOTE: Positive  ] coverage of the King 's remarks were tempered by coverage in the Socialist-aligned " [MISC El Pais  ] " daily of Socialist Secretary for [LOC International Relations Trinidad Jimenez'  ] attack on the opposition [ORG Popular Party  ] for having drawn [LOC Spain  ] into an " illegal war " in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
END NOTE . 
) <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Charge responded that we had noticed the positive tone and actions on the part of the [ORG GOS  ] and would report these to [LOC Washington  ] . 
However , Charge noted what we were most interested in the moment was [MISC Spanish  ] leadership of a PRT in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Dezcallar  ] said [LOC Spain  ] wanted to lead a PRT , but qualified this position when pressed , indicating [LOC Spain  ] would lead a PRT " if it was in the right location . 
" [PER Dezcallar  ] said that the [ORG GOS  ] had sent an MOD representative to [LOC London  ] to discuss precisely where [LOC Spain  ] would like to deploy next . 
( NOTE: We confirmed through the [LOC UK  ] Embassy that [LOC Spain  ] had asked to take over the [LOC UK  ] PRT in [LOC Mazar-i-Sharif  ] . 
The [LOC UK  ] Ambassador told Charge that the [LOC UK  ] had not responded immediately to the request and was not inclined to transfer that mission to [LOC Spain  ] . 
END NOTE . 
) //COMMENT// <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) After months of urging the [ORG GOS  ] to cease gratuitous criticism of the [ORG Coalition  ] effort in [LOC Iraq  ] , we appear to be closer to a turning point with the [ORG Zapatero Government  ] , though evidently not with all members of the [ORG Socialist Party  ] . 
[ORG MFA  ] and [LOC Moncloa  ] representatives have gone to great lengths to ensure that we are taking note of their positive actions on issues such as [LOC Iraq  ] . 
While not supportive of the [ORG USG  ] mission , [ORG GOS  ] officials are clearly aware that it is more productive to contribute to [LOC Iraq  ] 's reconstruction than to reiterate their opposition to the war itself . 
They are clearly extending their hand to us and we believe it is important that we both acknowledge the positive [MISC Spanish  ] gestures and encourage further positive measures on the part of the [ORG GOS  ] , for example by leading a PRT in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and/or providing training for [MISC Iraqi  ] security personnel in [LOC Spain  ] . 
At the very least , we should take advantage of their current interest in repairing ties with us to accomplish key [ORG USG  ] objectives in [LOC Afghanistan  ] .
