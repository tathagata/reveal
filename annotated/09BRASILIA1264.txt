( C ) Summary: [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula  ] is now comfortable with the [ORG U.S.-Colombia Defense Cooperation Agreement  ] ( [ORG DCA  ] ) , following a successful meeting and visit to [LOC Sao Paulo  ] by [MISC Colombian  ] President [PER Uribe  ] on October 19 , according to [MISC Colombian  ] Ambassador in [LOC Brasilia  ] [PER Tony Jozame  ] . 
On October 21 [PER Jozame  ] told [PER PolOff  ] that [PER Lula  ] took a pragmatic stance on the agreement and explained that [LOC Brazil  ] initially reacted negatively to the [ORG DCA  ] because it was " rejected by the region . 
" Though [PER Lula  ] requested an additional statement in the agreement further clarifying that operations from the bases under the [ORG DCA  ] could only be conducted in [LOC Colombia  ] , [PER Uribe  ] explained to [PER Lula  ] , s apparent satisfaction that the agreement already sufficiently covered the issue . 
According to [PER Jozame  ] , a [MISC Brazilian  ] congressional delegation will visit [LOC Colombia  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] , and [LOC Ecuador  ] in November and , at the [ORG GOC  ] , s invitation , will stop in some of the bases covered by the [ORG DCA  ] . 
End summary. -------------------------------------- [PER LULA  ] PRAGMATICALLY ACCEPTS [ORG DCA  ] -------------------------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Jozame  ] told [PER PolOff  ] on October 21 that [MISC Colombian  ] President [PER Uribe  ] successfully quelled [MISC Brazilian  ] President [PER Lula  ] , s concerns over the [ORG U.S.-Colombia DCA  ] during his October 19 visit to [LOC Sao Paulo  ] . 
[PER Jozame  ] described the [ORG GOB  ] , s initial reaction to the [ORG DCA  ] , particularly from its [ORG Ministry of Foreign Relations  ] ( [ORG MRE  ] ) , as negative and kneejerk , at times joining instead of moderating the chorus created by [LOC Venezuela  ] , [LOC Bolivia  ] , and [LOC Ecuador  ] ( Ref A and B ) . 
While WHA Deputy Assistant Secretary [PER Christopher McMullen  ] , s visit to [LOC Brazil  ] in late August helped clear the air on the intent and specifics behind the [ORG DCA  ] , some senior [ORG GOB  ] officials , including [ORG FM Amorim  ] and [ORG Presidential Advisor Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] , continued to openly question and criticize the agreement ( Ref C ) . 
According to [PER Jozame  ] , [PER Lula  ] is pragmatic and his acceptance of the [ORG DCA  ] suggests it will no longer be an issue in [LOC Brazil.  ] <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Jozame  ] said that during [PER Uribe  ] , s visit , [PER Lula  ] took a very expected and pragmatic stance on the [ORG U.S.-Colombia DCA  ] . 
[PER Lula  ] is now " tranquilo " ( calm ) about the accord , [PER Jozame  ] explained . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] newspapers quoted [PER Lula  ] as saying , " I trust in the words of Presidents [PER Uribe  ] and [MISC Obama  ] " and " [LOC Brazil  ] has no reason to be troubled " by the [ORG DCA  ] following his meeting with [PER Uribe  ] . 
According to [PER Jozame  ] , [PER Lula  ] explained to [PER Uribe  ] that because the announcement of the [ORG DCA  ] was a surprise and the reaction in the region was so negative , [LOC Brazil  ] could not fully or immediately accept the agreement itself . 
[PER Jozame  ] said that when [PER Uribe  ] explained that the motivation for the [ORG DCA  ] and partnership with the [LOC United States  ] was to combat terrorists in [LOC Colombia  ] and protect its borders , [PER Lula  ] responded by saying that [LOC Brazil  ] also wants to fortify security along its own borders. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) According to [PER Jozame  ] , [PER Lula  ] did ask that a short statement be included in the agreement stating that operations out of the bases under the [ORG DCA  ] could only be conducted within [MISC Colombian  ] borders . 
[PER Uribe  ] explained to [PER Lula  ] that such language was already in the document and understood because [LOC Colombia  ] cannot sign an agreement that would infringe on any other country , s sovereignty . 
According to [PER Jozame  ] , [PER Lula  ] appeared to be satisfied with [PER Uribe  ] , s response and guarantee. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) [PER Jozame  ] said [PER Uribe  ] , s visit with [PER Lula  ] went very well . 
In addition to the successful discussions over the [ORG DCA  ] , [PER Uribe  ] also had two useful meetings in which members of the [MISC Colombian  ] and [MISC Brazilian  ] business sectors met ; one of the meetings was public and the other private . 
One of the visible results of the meeting included a display of over 100 [MISC Colombian  ] paintings in the [ORG Federation of Industries of Sao Paulo State  ] ( [ORG FIESP  ] ) for the next two months. -------------------------------------- [LOC COLOMBIA  ] MISSION IN [LOC BRASILIA  ] CONTINUES TO CLEAR THE AIR ON [ORG DCA  ] -------------------------------------- [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00001264 002.2 OF 002 <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Jozame  ] explained that he continues to inform the [ORG GOB  ] and [MISC Latin American  ] missions in [LOC Brasilia  ] about the [ORG U.S.-Colombia DCA  ] , in an attempt to combat the misinformation campaign led by [PER Chavez  ] and the other more left-leaning neighbors in the region . 
In meetings in August [PER Jozame  ] told [PER PolOff  ] he had already met with several [MISC Brazilian  ] members of [ORG Congress  ] and the leadership of the [MISC Latin American  ] missions in [LOC Brasilia  ] ( Ref A ) . 
[PER Jozame  ] said that he had recently held a meeting at the [MISC Colombian  ] Embassy with about 35 military attaches from embassies in [LOC Brasilia  ] so that he and his staff could again clarify the details of the [ORG U.S.-Colombia DCA  ] . 
[PER Jozame  ] also mentioned that a [MISC Brazilian  ] congressional delegation will be traveling to [LOC Colombia  ] , [LOC Venezuela  ] , and [LOC Ecuador  ] in November . 
According to [PER Jozame  ] , their goal in [LOC Colombia  ] is to see for themselves the bases included in the [ORG DCA  ] . 
[PER Jozame  ] said he is happy the [MISC Brazilians  ] have finally taken the [MISC Colombians  ] up on the invitation to visit the bases because all they will see at the bases are " some buildings and a landing strip . 
" <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Jozame  ] shared his personal views as to why the [MISC Brazilians  ] had such a negative initial reaction to the [ORG DCA  ] , claiming that most of the problem came from the [ORG MRE  ] which is " leftist " and " anti-Yankee " and " jealous " of any other country , s leadership in the region . 
[PER Jozame  ] said that the leadership in the [ORG MRE  ] is very leftist and because of that they did not support greater cooperation between [LOC Colombia  ] and the [LOC United States  ] . 
Also , he believes [LOC Brazil  ] is jealous because it does not like to have any issues negotiated or discussed without [LOC Brazil  ] serving in a leadership role. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Comment: [PER Lula  ] , s open approval of the [ORG U.S.-Colombia DCA  ] will make it hard for the [ORG GOB  ] to support criticism of the agreement by others in the region against the agreement . 
However , as [PER Lula  ] admitted and several [ORG GOB  ] officials have told us privately , [LOC Brazil  ] , s initial reaction was driven by the reaction of others in the region " principally [LOC Venezuela  ] " and by a perceived need to maintain " balance " and the ability to mediate between the two sides . 
This dynamic is likely to hold sway in the future , as well , regarding issues of sovereignty and the sanctity of borders .
