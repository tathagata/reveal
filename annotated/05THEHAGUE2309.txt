( [ORG S  ] ) SUMMARY: With the [ORG EU  ] divided and its direction uncertain , the [MISC Dutch  ] serve as a vital transatlantic anchor in [LOC Europe  ] . 
As one of the original six [ORG EU  ] members , the [MISC Dutch  ] ally with the [MISC British  ] to counter [MISC Franco-German  ] efforts to steer [LOC Europe  ] off a transatlantic course . 
The [MISC Netherlands’  ] solid [MISC European  ] and international credentials create a powerful “multiplier” effect . 
In [LOC Iraq  ] , [MISC Dutch  ] forces provided the physical and political cover for [LOC Japan  ] to deploy and the [MISC Dutch  ] are using their [ORG NATO  ] Training Mission commitment to push others to do more . 
In [LOC Afghanistan  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] drove much of the [ORG Phase III  ] planning for [ORG ISAF  ] and deployed [MISC Dutch  ] troops in combat operations for the first time in more than 30 years . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have led [LOC Europe  ] in launching pilot projects to strengthen international counterterrorism cooperation , and initiated the [MISC U.S.-EU  ] dialogue on terrorist financing which laid the groundwork for a proposed major international [ORG Terrorism Financing Conference  ] in 2006. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) ( SUMMARY CONTINUED ) The [MISC Dutch  ] are expanding their leadership beyond [LOC Europe  ] . 
[MISC Dutch  ] strategic interests in the [LOC Caribbean  ] make them logical partners to counter [MISC Venezuelan  ] meddling in the region . 
They are expanding their military involvement in [LOC Africa  ] , in part to provide a secure environment for their robust development assistance program , and in part to add “eyes and ears” on the ground . 
In the [LOC Middle East  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] enjoy good relations with [LOC Israel  ] and the [MISC Palestinians  ] and would welcome a more active role ; they quickly promised funds for an expanded [ORG Multinational Observer Force  ] ( [ORG MFO  ] ) and might , under the right circumstances , commit troops . 
Even in areas where we disagree , such as drugs and trafficking in persons , [MISC Dutch  ] views may be shifting . 
As the headquarters for major international legal institutions , the [LOC Netherlands  ] offers a unique opportunity for advancing foreign policy goals far beyond [MISC Dutch  ] borders. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) ( SUMMARY CONTINUED ) The coalition government , headed by PM [PER Balkenende  ] , is naturally inclined to work closely with the [LOC U.S.  ] The balance could shift toward [LOC Brussels  ] , however , if a center-left government comes to power in 2007 ( or earlier ) , as predicted by most polls . 
The nearly one million [MISC Muslim  ] immigrants are largely non-integrated , which is forcing the [MISC Dutch  ] to question long-standing assumptions about [MISC Dutch  ] “tolerance” and “identity.” The murder of [PER Theo van Gogh  ] focused attention on [MISC Islamic  ] extremism , and the [MISC Dutch  ] feel they are ahead of much of [LOC Europe  ] in addressing this growing problem . 
Strengthening U.S.-Dutch ties across the political spectrum is necessary to ensure that the [MISC Dutch  ] continue to enlist others to pursue interests in line with the [LOC U.S.  ] , especially in the political-military sphere . 
Early and active consultations are the key to harnessing [MISC Dutch  ] energies in enhanced pursuit of [LOC U.S.  ] interests . 
END SUMMARY . 
LEADERS IN [LOC EUROPE  ] ----------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Along with the [MISC British  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] form a strong , reliable transatlantic anchor in [LOC Europe  ] . 
As a founding member of [ORG NATO  ] , one of the original six members of the [ORG EU  ] , and [MISC Britain’s  ] strongest ally on continent , the [MISC Dutch  ] are an influential voice in [LOC Europe  ] despite having a population of just under 16 million . 
Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] states often that the [MISC Dutch  ] “take their responsibilities seriously” and therefore expect to be heard . 
While the [MISC Dutch  ] “no” to the EU’s constitutional treaty embarrassed [PER Balkenende  ] , the vote revealed that the search for [ORG EU  ] integration and consensus has its limits , capping a trend that started in the 90’s with then [ORG Liberal Party  ] leader ( and later [ORG EU  ] Commissioner ) [PER Fritz Bolkestein’s  ] proposals to redefine the scope of [MISC European  ] integration to protect [MISC Dutch  ] national interests. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) With the [MISC French-German  ] engine of [MISC European  ] integration stalled , [MISC German  ] elections pending , and the [ORG EU  ] unable to agree on finances , leadership opportunities for the [MISC Dutch  ] are growing . 
This trend is enhanced by the gravitation of [ORG EU  ] decision making to smaller groups , as [MISC Dutch  ] participation can make or break internal groupings . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] and [MISC Italian  ] refusal to attend a “group of six” meeting recently proposed by [PER Schroeder  ] , for example , effectively squelched his initiative . 
The [MISC British  ] Ambassador here recently confided that [PER Blair  ] sees the [MISC Dutch  ] as essential to pursuing his [MISC European  ] objectives and ensuring that transatlantic relations remain high on the [MISC European  ] agenda . 
The leaders of the [LOC Netherlands  ] , [LOC UK  ] , [LOC Norway  ] , [LOC Denmark  ] , and [LOC Sweden  ] already meet quietly several times a year to coordinate positions prior to [ORG EU  ] Council and other high-level [ORG EU  ] meetings. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [MISC Dutch  ] leadership within the [ORG EU  ] does not weaken their commitment to [ORG NATO  ] , where they are “go-to guys” for resolving potential [MISC EU-NATO  ] conflicts . 
Their active , if often behind the scenes , support for [ORG NATO  ] SYG ( and former [MISC Dutch  ] Foreign Minister ) [ORG Jaap de  ] [PER Hoop Scheffer  ] , as well as their commitment to the [ORG NRF  ] ( and SRF , [ORG ISAF  ] , and [MISC NTM-I  ] ) , have helped push back efforts , such as Tervuren , which might otherwise create tensions between the [ORG NRF  ] and [ORG EU  ] battlegroups or other emerging ESDP capabilities . 
Foreign Minister Bot recently proposed restructuring NATO’s decision-making and funding mechanisms to make them more effective . 
The appointment of [PER Herman Schaper  ] , the former deputy director general of political affairs at the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG MFA  ] and a good friend of the [LOC U.S.  ] , as the new [MISC Dutch  ] permrep to [ORG NATO  ] should create more opportunities for productive cooperation . 
POLITICAL-MILITARY COOPERATION BEYOND THE [ORG EU  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [MISC Dutch  ] are increasingly aware that strategic interests outside [LOC Europe  ] warrant their attention and leadership , especially in the political-military sphere . 
For example: - [MISC Venezuela:  ] The [MISC Dutch  ] have strategic interests in the [LOC Caribbean  ] ( i.e. , the [LOC Netherlands Antilles  ] and [LOC Aruba  ] ) and are deeply concerned about [PER Chavez’  ] meddling in the region . 
As a [LOC Caribbean  ] power , the [MISC Dutch  ] have good reasons to lead an effort to balance traditional [MISC Spanish  ] dominance on [MISC Latin American  ] issues in the [ORG EU  ] , but the [LOC U.S.  ] and others will need to push them to take this role . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are active partners in regional drug enforcement efforts , and recently demonstrated their ability to deploy military forces ( [MISC F-16’s  ] ) on short notice . 
Persuading the [MISC Dutch  ] to counter Chavez’s destabilization efforts more actively would give us a reliable [MISC European  ] partner in the region. - [MISC Afghanistan: According  ] to [ORG CENTCOM  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] took a strong lead in organizing and soliciting forces to staff [ORG ISAF  ] Phase III , and are now preparing to deploy up to 1,400 personnel in conjunction with [MISC British  ] , [MISC Canadian  ] , and possibly [MISC Australian  ] forces . 
Separately , the [MISC Dutch  ] deployment of Special Forces in a combat role represents a major shift in [MISC Dutch  ] priorities away from peace-keeping to combat missions for the first time since the 1960’s . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] remain a strong supporter in the war on terrorism in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
We should encourage them both to continue to make significant contributions , and to push others to do more. - [MISC Africa: Senior  ] [MISC Dutch  ] military officials say they are considering expanding their military presence in [LOC Africa  ] to include [LOC Burundi  ] , [LOC Rwanda  ] , [LOC Eastern Congo  ] , [LOC Botswana  ] , [LOC Zambia  ] , and [LOC Ivory Coast  ] , adding new “eyes and ears” on the ground . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have requested embedding a cell at EUCOM ( similar to that already operating in [ORG CENTCOM  ] ) to coordinate their actions with the [LOC U.S.  ] and other allies . 
One objective of the [MISC Dutch  ] military deployments is to provide a secure environment for what is already one of the most ambitious assistance programs in the world . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are the fourth largest provider of assistance to [LOC Africa  ] world-wide . 
In 2005 they established a 110 million [MISC Euro Stability Fund  ] for security sector reform in the [MISC African Great Lakes Region  ] and [LOC Sudan  ] ( as well as [LOC Afghanistan  ] and [LOC Iraq  ] . 
) [MISC Dutch  ] deployments in [LOC Africa  ] have solid support in [LOC Parliament  ] , while the focus on security as an aspect of development provides an attractive justification for potential [MISC European  ] partners . 
We should not only encourage the [MISC Dutch  ] to increase their direct involvement in [LOC Africa  ] , but also explore whether the [MISC Dutch  ] could act as a “clearinghouse” for other interested parties. - [MISC Iraq:  ] The [MISC Dutch  ] were instrumental in providing early logistic support to [LOC U.S.  ] forces in [LOC Iraq  ] ( including permitting transshipments through [LOC Rotterdam  ] when other ports in [LOC Europe  ] would not . 
) The [MISC Dutch  ] deployed 1,200 troops directly to the southern province of al-Muthanna for 20 months , including two controversial extensions . 
Although the [MISC Dutch  ] have since withdrawn from al-Muthanna , their presence provided the political and military cover necessary for [LOC Japan  ] to commit forces . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] provided 25 trainers for the [ORG NATO Training Mission in Iraq  ] , and have offered to provide up to 100 if other countries would make comparable contributions . 
We should urge the [MISC Dutch  ] to continue to push their [ORG EU  ] and [ORG NATO  ] partners to do more in [LOC Iraq.  ] - [ORG Middle East:  ] The [MISC Dutch  ] enjoy a reputation for “balance” almost unique in [LOC Europe  ] , as they are strong supporters of [LOC Israel  ] , yet trusted by [MISC Arabs  ] . 
Given Foreign Minister Bot’s expressed willingness to take a more active regional role . 
We should look for opportunities to harness [MISC Dutch  ] interest through participation in the [ORG Forum for the Future  ] and other initiatives . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have already promised to make a financial contribution to an expanded [ORG Multinational Observer Force  ] ( [ORG MFO  ] ) if asked , and , under the right circumstances , might be prepared to send peace-keepers to the region as well. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) These commitments demonstrate how the [MISC Dutch  ] “take their responsibilities seriously” in practice by committing real resources -- money , troops , hardware , and political capital -- to tackle real problems , as well as their “multiplier” effect in the political-military realm . 
The fact that the [MISC Dutch  ] are providing the head ( [PER Peter Feith  ] ) and observers to the [MISC EU’s  ] new monitoring mission in Aceh is the latest example of their assuming leadership of an important international mission in a region where they feel special ties ( as witnessed by FM Bot’s historic decision this year to attend the commemoration of [MISC Indonesian  ] independence , the first such visit by a senior [MISC Dutch  ] official since [MISC Indonesian  ] independence ) . <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [MISC Dutch  ] have one of the largest , most geographically diverse deployments of military forces in the world , with more troops deployed as a percentage of their total forces than any other ally . 
Defense Minister [LOC Kamp  ] and CHOD Berlijn recently restructured the [MISC Dutch  ] military to eliminate layers of bureaucracy , including independent service chiefs , thereby creating a leaner , more deployable force . 
[LOC Kamp  ] and [PER Berlijn  ] believe firmly in the “use or lose” principle , and have accordingly sought increasingly challenging operations -- such as the Special Forces deployment to [LOC Afghanistan  ] and potential operations in [LOC sub-Saharan Africa  ] . 
Their desire to maximize the military’s capabilities and their preference for [LOC U.S.  ] equipment , even when alternative [MISC European  ] suppliers exist , make the [MISC Dutch  ] strong supporters of the [ORG Joint Strike Fighter  ] ( [ORG JSF  ] ) program . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are one of only two countries ( [LOC Italy  ] is the other ) whose financial contributions merit Tier II status in [ORG JSF  ] development . 
[PER Berlijn  ] is pushing to lock in an early commitment for 50 planes ( out of a total of 85 ) to prevent [ORG JSF  ] from becoming an issue in the 2007 elections . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are also seeking Tactical Tomahawks for [MISC Dutch  ] frigates , additional lift capacity ( [MISC CH-47  ] , [MISC C-130  ] , [MISC KDC-10  ] ) , and are continuing to update their remaining hardware ( [MISC AH-64D  ] , [MISC F-16’s  ] , [ORG Patriot Missile System  ] , etc . 
) all of which are focused on meeting their [ORG Prague Capability Commitment  ] objectives as well as their ability to sustain extended expeditionary operations outside the [MISC European  ] theater . 
COUNTERTERRORISM COOPERATION ---------------------------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Faced with growing threats in their own country , as witnessed by the murder of [PER Theo van Gogh  ] in November 2004 , the [MISC Dutch  ] believe they are in the forefront of [LOC Europe  ] with regard to counterterrorism , arguing that legislation and other steps earlier adopted by the [MISC Dutch  ] are only now being considered in countries like the [LOC UK  ] and [LOC Italy  ] . 
Led by Justice Minister [PER Donner  ] and Finance Minister [PER Zalm  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] were the first in [LOC Europe  ] to implement the [ORG Container Security Initiative  ] ( [ORG CSI  ] ) , [PER Radiological Gates  ] , [PER DOE’s Megaports  ] program , [LOC U.S.  ] [MISC Customs’ Green Lane Program  ] , and , soon , [ORG Trusted Flyers  ] . 
[LOC China  ] has engaged the [MISC Dutch  ] on next generation protocols and standards for transport security , includng RFID technology . 
It will be important to monitor and work with the [MISC Dutch  ] as they work with [LOC China  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] have also expressed an interest to participate in DHS’s “Centers of [MISC Excellence.”  ] While the [ORG EU  ] was arguing with us and itself over releasing personal records to airlines , the [MISC Dutch  ] allowed [LOC U.S.  ] immigration teams ( [ORG IAP  ] ) to operate at [LOC Schipol  ] airport . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] were instrumental in pushing the [ORG EU  ] in 2003 to designate [ORG Hamas  ] in its entirety as a terrorist entity ; an [MISC EU-wide  ] designation of the [MISC Dutch  ] branch of the [LOC Al-Aqsa  ] followed . 
During their [ORG EU  ] Presidency the [MISC Dutch  ] hosted an [MISC EU-wide  ] seminar to raise awareness of terrorist financing issues and have offered to host a major international conference on the same subject in 2006 . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] continue to push for [ORG EU  ] designation of [ORG Hizballah  ] in its entirety and to strengthen the [MISC EU’s  ] “Clearinghouse” designation process . 
Given their record , we should continue to look to the [MISC Dutch  ] to launch joint pilot programs in [LOC Europe  ] , and , more generally , to push counterterrorism issues to the top of the [MISC European  ] agenda more generally . 
DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE ---------------------- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [LOC Netherlands  ] is among the world’s leading aid donors , having budgeted USD 4.2 billion ( 0.74 percent of GDP , with a target of raising it to 0.8 percent ) in assistance in 2004 . 
It is a top donor of unearmarked assistance to [ORG UN  ] humanitarian programs . 
In 2003 , the [LOC Netherlands  ] introduced a more focused aid strategy , which phased out smaller aid programs in wealthier countries . 
[MISC Dutch  ] bilateral aid is now directed to 36 partner countries , including 18 in [LOC Africa  ] . 
In 2003 , President [PER Bush  ] and Prime Minister [ORG Balkenende  ] signed an MOU to coordinate [MISC HIV/AIDS  ] programs in [LOC Ghana  ] , [LOC Zambia  ] , [LOC Rwanda  ] and [LOC Ethiopia  ] that emphasizes public-private partnerships . 
[ORG Balkenende  ] recently expressed interest in using the [ORG Millennium Challenge Corporation  ] as a model for promoting public-private partnerships world-wide . 
USAID’s involvement with a [MISC Heineken AIDS  ] treatment and education program in [LOC Rwanda  ] has been particularly successful , and the [ORG World Bank  ] has adopted it as a model . 
[MISC Dutch  ] creativity and credibility in development makes them good potential partners for future joint initiatives with the [LOC U.S.  ] We should also take advantage of their experience and insights to help shift global aid efforts in the direction of sustainable long-term development . 
[ORG CENTER OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) With the [ORG International Court of Justice  ] ( [ORG ICJ  ] ) , [ORG International Criminal Tribunal  ] for the former [LOC Yugoslavia  ] ( [ORG ICTY  ] ) , the [ORG Permanent Court of Arbitration  ] ( [ORG PCA  ] ) , the [MISC Iran-U.S  ] . 
[ORG Claims Tribunal  ] , the [ORG International Criminal Court  ] ( [ORG ICC  ] ) and other international legal institutions all located in The [LOC Hague  ] , our ability to have an impact in the [LOC Netherlands  ] on international issues ranging from [LOC Iraq  ] to the [LOC Balkans  ] is unique . 
With a historical interest in international law dating back to [MISC Grotius  ] , the [MISC Dutch  ] view themselves as natural defenders of international legal norms and practices . 
This tradition made them the perfect hosts for a conference of [MISC Iraqi  ] judges in The [LOC Hague  ] in 2004 , and has pushed them to the forefront of international efforts to train a new generation of [MISC Iraqi  ] jurists . 
While their legalistic approach can be frustrating , they are flexible . 
Their concerns about [LOC U.S.  ] interpretations of the [ORG Geneva Protocols  ] have not prevented their Special Forces from deploying in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] also helped sway the [ORG EU  ] to vote against the [MISC Cuban-sponsored  ] resolution on [LOC Guantanamo  ] at the [ORG Human Rights Commission  ] last year despite concerns about the treatment of detainees . 
But , as Foreign Minister Bot told Deputy Secretary [PER Zoellick  ] recently , over the long run [MISC Dutch  ] human rights concerns must be addressed to ensure that public and parliamentary support does not erode ; we and the [MISC Dutch  ] need to work together to resolve this concern . 
Finally , the [MISC Dutch  ] combination of seeking pragmatic solutions while remaining true to their legal principles could make the [MISC Dutch  ] an important asset in resolving our differences with the [ORG EU  ] over the [ORG ICC  ] and article 98 agreements under the right circumstances . 
ECONOMICS AND TRADE ------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG Balkenende  ] shares our interest in promoting an open international trading system and has been an ally in [MISC U.S.-EU  ] trade disputes such as Boeing-Airbus and the Foreign Sales Corporation Tax . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] share with the [MISC British  ] a vision of a market-friendly [LOC Europe  ] driven by free trade . 
They are the third largest investor in the [LOC U.S.  ] and the fourth largest recipient of [LOC U.S.  ] investment world-wide . 
Their efforts to shift the [LOC Lisbon  ] agenda in a more cooperative direction and to promote innovation and competition are creating additional opportunities for [LOC U.S.  ] investors in [LOC Europe  ] . 
Because the [LOC Netherlands  ] has one of the highest broadband penetrations in [LOC Europe  ] , emerging research efforts in the areas of nanotechnology , life sciences , and other IT-related areas , and a new tax treaty , the country offers [LOC U.S.  ] companies an important gateway into [LOC Europe  ] . 
If consulted early and regularly , the [LOC Netherlands  ] can also be an important ally in navigating the [MISC EU’s  ] regulatory environment and removing obstacles . 
DRUGS AND TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS -------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Narcotics and trafficking in persons remain areas of difficulty . 
Despite fundamental differences regarding “soft drugs” and legalized prostitution , the [ORG Balkenende  ] government has worked to prevent these differences from defining our relationship . 
There are also signs that [MISC Dutch  ] attitudes may be shifting . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] remain a major producer of synthetic drugs . 
On the other hand , [MISC Dutch  ] Health Minister Hoogevorst recently signed a precedent-setting MOU with the [LOC U.S.  ] to share information on the health risks of new strains of marijuana with higher concentrations of [ORG THC  ] , which may convince the [MISC Dutch  ] to rethink their approach to “soft drugs” in general . 
The [MISC Dutch  ] are addressing drug tourism -- a recent proposal to restrict the sale of marijuana to [MISC Dutch  ] passport holders in [LOC Maastricht  ] , for example , could cut down on cross-border smuggling and other drug-related crime . 
We should support such initiatives actively . 
[ORG BALKENENDE  ] SOLID INTERNATIONALLY... ----------------------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) We are fortunate to have in the [ORG Balkenende  ] government an outward-looking partner for whom working with the [LOC U.S.  ] and the [LOC U.K.  ] comes naturally . 
[ORG Balkenende  ] and FM Bot take pride in building bridges between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Europe  ] . 
Nowhere was this more evident than during the [MISC Dutch  ] presidency of the [ORG EU  ] . 
On two issues of great importance to the [LOC U.S.  ] -- the [LOC China  ] Arms [PER Embargo  ] and accession talks for [LOC Turkey  ] -- the [MISC Dutch  ] moved , with our active urging , from following an [ORG EU  ] “consensus” set by others to redefining the issue on their , and our , terms . 
In both cases , Bot and [ORG Balkenende  ] overcame initial skepticism and concluded that [MISC Dutch  ] and [LOC U.S.  ] interests coincided -- a pattern we have seen repeated on other less important issues . 
FM Bot began the [ORG EU  ] presidency telling us that lifting the Arms [PER Embargo  ] was a “done deal.” Later , however , he actively intervened to prevent a lift on “his” watch , saying that he did not want the blame for causing a rift between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG EU  ] . 
Despite Balkenende’s personal skepticism about bringing [LOC Turkey  ] into the [ORG EU  ] , he and Bot ( a former Ambassador to [LOC Turkey  ] ) worked hard to ensure that [LOC Turkey  ] got its date to start accession talks with the [ORG EU  ] during the [MISC Dutch  ] presidency , and want to see the agreement they helped negotiate successfully implemented . 
We will want the [MISC Dutch  ] to continue to draw on the relationships they developed during the presidency to coax both sides to move in the right direction as October 3 approaches. <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Specific [LOC U.S.  ] policies provoke squalls of anger and frustration here , but President Bush’s visit to the [LOC Netherlands  ] in 2005 to commemorate V-E day at the WWII [MISC Dutch  ] [LOC American Cemetery  ] at [LOC Margraten  ] was met with universal acclaim and provoked remarkably little protest . 
Even [MISC Dutch  ] opposed to [LOC U.S.  ] policies warmly welcomed the visit as a reminder of enduring , shared values forged in the crucibles of [MISC World War II  ] and the [MISC Cold War  ] . 
This mission has pursued an ambitious program of outreach to future [MISC Dutch  ] leaders to ensure that these emotions are passed to the next generation . 
In this effort , the President’s youth roundtable in [LOC Maastricht  ] and former Secretary of State Powell’s town hall meeting with young leaders in The [LOC Hague  ] were notable successes , which can serve as models for future efforts . 
Given the disproportionate influence wielded by the [MISC Dutch  ] in international fora , we should expand our active exchange programs ( including the [ORG Fulbright and International Visitor Leadership Programs  ] ) to help shape the successor generation. ...BUT FACES DOMESTIC CHALLENGES -------------------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Unfortunately , the outward-looking , transatlantic orientation of the [ORG Balkenende  ] cabinet is offset domestically by strong strains of [MISC Euro-centralism  ] and [MISC Dutch-provincialism  ] . 
This division will become more pronounced as the parties prepare for local elections in March 2006 , and national elections in May 2007 . 
Current polls show that Balkenende’s center-right coalition ( his second government ) is falling in the polls , while the main , center-left opposition [ORG Labor  ] party ( [ORG PvdA  ] ) and fringes on the right and left are gaining . 
[ORG Balkenende  ] is gambling that his economic reform agenda will pay dividends in time for the 2007 elections , but that is uncertain . 
There is a strong chance that a center-left government dominated by the [ORG PvdA  ] will come to power in 2007 -- or earlier if the 2006 local election results prompt national elections. <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Although [MISC U.S.-Dutch  ] relations should remain fundamentally sound despite a shift to the center-left , a [MISC PvdA-led  ] government would present new challenges . 
[ORG PvdA  ] leader [PER Wouter Bos  ] has made clear his tendency to look to [LOC Brussels  ] first in setting [MISC Dutch  ] international priorities . 
He sees the [LOC Netherlands  ] less as a transatlantic “bridge builder” than as a follower of [ORG EU  ] consensus . 
As with [PER Schroeder  ] in [LOC Germany  ] , [PER Bos  ] might also find it tempting to adopt a critical attitude toward the [LOC U.S.  ] during elections to lock in his left flank . 
The [ORG PvdA  ] is already raising allegations of [LOC U.S.  ] abuses to challenge the rationale for [MISC Dutch  ] deployments in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , and does not support the JSF program . 
It is in our interest both to support the current government’s transatlantic orientation and to engage actively with the opposition to shift them in a favorable direction . 
THE ISLAMIC FACTOR ------------------ <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) A new , but potentially serious factor in [MISC Dutch  ] domestic politics is its large , poorly integrated [MISC Muslim  ] population , currently numbering just under 1 million , or 5.8 percent of the population . 
USG-sponsored polls show that 83 percent of [MISC Dutch  ] Muslims identify much more strongly with their religion than with their host country , while 51 percent have little or no faith in the [MISC Dutch  ] government as an institution . 
While the problems of [MISC Dutch  ] integration captured international headlines following the van [MISC Gogh  ] murder , the [MISC Dutch  ] believe they have an early start on the rest of [LOC Europe  ] in seeking creative ways to address these concerns . 
Their strong interest in sharing and soliciting ideas has opened up opportunities for Embassy and [ORG USG  ] outreach and consultations throughout [MISC Dutch  ] society , providing insights into a growing problem throughout [LOC Europe  ] . 
We expect our experiences here will provide good indications of broader [MISC European  ] trends as well as opportunities to influence their direction . 
CONCLUSIONS ----------- <a id='par20' href='#par20'>¶</a>20 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [LOC Netherlands  ] is a complicated , multi-layered society . 
Prevailing myths about the [MISC Dutch  ] -- e.g. , they are homogenous , universally tolerant , pacifist , etc.-- do not accurately gauge differences within society or reflect [MISC Dutch  ] potential to influence international events . 
While the [MISC Dutch  ] prefer to see themselves as “balancing” between [LOC Europe  ] and the [LOC U.S.  ] , this balance can shift due to domestic and international factors. <a id='par21' href='#par21'>¶</a>21 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The key to maximizing [MISC Dutch  ] effectiveness is to involve them early through high-level consultations and exchanges . 
[MISC Dutch  ] pragmatism and our similar world-views make the [LOC Netherlands  ] fertile ground for initiatives others in [LOC Europe  ] might be reluctant , at least initially , to embrace. <a id='par22' href='#par22'>¶</a>22 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) As multipliers , the [MISC Dutch  ] should be encouraged to play an increasingly prominent role on the global stage . 
Coaxing the [MISC Dutch  ] into the spotlight can take effort , but pays off royally . 
[MISC Dutch  ] credentials , credibility , and capabilities make them effective leaders across a wide range of geographic regions and substantive issues. <a id='par23' href='#par23'>¶</a>23 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [MISC Dutch  ] are actively and favorably involved in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , [LOC Africa  ] , [LOC Iraq  ] , the [LOC Middle East  ] , the [LOC Balkans  ] , the [LOC Caribbean  ] , [LOC Indonesia  ] , and elsewhere . 
They are our best partner in developing pilot projects in the counterterrorism area , and are world leaders in development , free trade , international law and human rights . 
In pursuit of [LOC U.S.  ] interests in all these areas of interest and leadership , we should build upon our successes to date to take the [MISC Dutch  ] to the “next level.” SOBEL</pre></code>
