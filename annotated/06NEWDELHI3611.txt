NEW [LOC DELHI  ] 3057 C. 05 NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 6596 Classified By: Charge [PER Robert Blake  ] , Jr. for Reasons 1.4 ( B , D ) <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( U ) This is an Action Request for [ORG SCA  ] and S/CT . 
Please see [PER Para  ] 17. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) [ORG Summary:  ] The [ORG DCM  ] and key Embassy interlocutors on counterterrorism issues ( see Paras 21-22 ) on May 19 reviewed with [ORG MEA  ] Additional Secretary ( [ORG International Organizations  ] ) [ORG KC Singh  ] action items that emerged from the April 19 [ORG US-India Counterterrorism Joint Working Group  ] ( CTJWG ) meeting in [LOC Washington  ] and subsequent [MISC CT-related  ] conversations ( [ORG Refs A  ] and B ) . 
The dialogue paved the way for further discussions on bio-terrorism cooperation , operationalizing countering terrorism finance , aviation security , improving [ORG USG  ] delivery of [LOC CT  ] training ( and a [MISC GOI  ] offer to provide [LOC CT  ] training to [ORG USG  ] personnel ) , improving the sharing of [MISC GOI  ] tactical terrorist threat information , and continuing the discussion on how most effectively to counter extremist ideology in mass media and on the [MISC Internet  ] . 
Ambassador [ORG Singh  ] and Joint Secretary ( [ORG Cabinet Secretariat  ] ) [ORG Sharad Kumar  ] also shared [MISC GOI  ] concerns that [LOC India  ] is becoming more central to al-Qai’da’s agenda , and that al-Qa’ida and “al-Qa’ida franchises” share close links with the [LOC Pakistan  ] establishment . 
The [MISC Indians  ] again were receptive to the idea of a focused effort to defeat [ORG LTTE  ] fund-raising and arms trafficking , but asked that this be couched in generic terms , rather than targeting [LOC Sri Lanka  ] alone . 
End Summary . 
[LOC India  ] Now an al-Qa’ida Target ----------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [ORG Singh  ] opened by noting that [LOC India  ] is becoming more prominent on al-Qai’da’s radar , pointing to [MISC Ayman  ] al-Zawahiri’s April 29 video message praising “popular jihadist movements against [MISC Indians  ] in [LOC Kashmir”  ] and calling [LOC India  ] “the best candidate for carrying out the [MISC Zionist-Crusader  ] scheme to humiliate , weaken , and dismember [MISC Pakistan.” He  ] added that al-Zawahiri’s recent reference to the [MISC US-India  ] civil nuclear agreement demonstrated that Delhi’s growing cooperation with [LOC Washington  ] was drawing al-Qai’da’s attention . 
Alleging Direct Links Between al-Qa’ida and [LOC Islamabad  ] --------------------------------------------- -------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( S ) [ORG Singh  ] asserted that Pakistan’s ISI retains connections to al-Qa’ida and has been privy to [PER Usama  ] bin Ladin’s communications . 
To the DCM’s question of information on operational links , Joint Secretary ( [ORG Cabinet Secretariat  ] , i.e . 
RAW ) [ORG Sharad Kumar  ] stated that [MISC Indian  ] intelligence has transcripts of pre-9/11 meetings between [PER UBL  ] and [PER Mullah Omar  ] during which terrorism in J&K was discussed . 
He continued that [PER UBL  ] had been “willing to divert $20 million” from [MISC Central Asian  ] programming to support Kashmir-oriented NEW [LOC DELHI  ] 00003611 002 OF 008 terrorism , and that [PER UBL  ] was quoted saying the [PER Kashmiri  ] jihadis “would not run short of funds.” [PER Kumar  ] added that when [PER UBL  ] sent his bodyguard contingent to help the [ORG Taliban  ] fight the [LOC Northern Alliance  ] , the temporary chief of his security force was an unnamed individual who went on to join [MISC Jaish-e-Mohammad  ] . 
[ORG Singh  ] ascribed al-Qa’ida’s increasing interest in [LOC India  ] to the July 18 civil nuclear agreement. “ISI seeks to heat things up” to interfere with growing [MISC US-India  ] convergence , he claimed. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( S ) RAW’s [PER Kumar  ] observed that today , “al-Qa’ida franchises , ” if not al-Qa’ida proper , are and have been very active in [LOC India  ] . 
He defined “al-Qa’ida franchises” as groups that espouse the same extremist ideology and share some logistical and funding infrastructure even while remaining discrete organizations , such as [ORG Lashkar-e-Tayyiba  ] and [MISC Jaish-e-Mohammad  ] . 
Not all these groups or their attacks are linked , he continued ; each must be investigated individually to locate their intersections . 
[ORG Delhi Interest  ] in [LOC Bio-Terror Rising  ] ----------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Turning to the subject of counter-bio-terrorism cooperation , [ORG Singh  ] reported that [MISC Indian  ] intelligence is picking up chatter indicating jihadi groups are interested in bio-terrorism , for example seeking out like-minded PhD’s in biology and bio-technology . 
He compared the prospects for nuclear terrorism ( “still in the realm of the imaginary” ) to bio-terrorism ( “an ideal weapon for terrorism ... anthrax could pose a serious problem ...it is no longer an academic exercise for us.” ) and indicated conceptual support for a joint bio-terrorism exercise . 
[ORG Singh  ] stated that the text of the 1997 HHS/Ministry of Health Joint Statement included provisions for modeling bio-terrorism attacks , which could be used as a mechanism to support a joint exercise . 
( NOTE: Embassy [PER HHS Attache  ] reviewed the 1997 and 2005 [MISC HHS/MoH  ] agreements and found no such mention of modeling bio-terrorism . 
End Note . 
) He concluded that although other relevant Ministries “work at their own pace , ” [ORG MEA  ] would confer with them to secure their buy-in . 
Embassy will pursue the matter with [ORG MEA  ] and other [ORG GOI  ] interlocutors with an eye to conducting a joint and multi-agency bio-terrorism tabletop exercise by late 2006 . 
Operationalizing Anti-Terrorism Finance --------------------------------------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Noting that both sides have identical interests in combating terrorist groups but no practical experience in joint operations with each other , the [ORG DCM  ] revisited the suggestion to create a contact group of experts -- with the [ORG MEA  ] as the hub but including the [MISC Indian  ] [ORG Finance Ministry  ] and the nascent [MISC Financial Intelligence Unit  ] as well as the Embassy Economics Section -- to focus on squeezing [ORG LTTE  ] finances ( [ORG Refs A  ] and B ) . 
The [ORG DCM  ] and [ORG Singh  ] agreed that to keep the operation out of the spotlight it could adopt an innocuous name such as the “Subgroup on Terror [MISC Finance.”  ] NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00003611 003 OF 008 PolCouns underscored the importance of moving from exchanging data on terrorist finances to shutting down money flows , particularly in light of the [MISC LTTE’s  ] wealth ( i.e. it’s ability to fund both a navy and an air force ) and its recent egregiously violent attacks . 
[PER J/S Kumar  ] was tasked to develop ideas about modalities of the group’s operations ; he observed that although a cooperative effort is the most effective way forward , “most of our people are cagey regarding cooperation and joint operations , ” and “do not even trust others in their own government” ; however , he added , their buy-in will be required . 
The [ORG DCM  ] reassured [PER Kumar  ] that these operations would be kept in secure channels and well away from the media . 
Please see Action Request in [ORG Para  ] 17 . 
[ORG Aviation Security  ] ----------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) Taking note of the increase in aviation links between the [LOC US  ] and [LOC India  ] under the [ORG Open Skies  ] agreement , including twice-daily non-stop flights , the [ORG DCM  ] requested an official briefing on the [MISC GOI’s  ] anti-hijacking policy ( Ref C ) -- specifically , a full briefing to relevant Embassy elements ( [ORG RSO  ] , [LOC ECON  ] , [LOC POL  ] , etc . 
) plus advice on how Embassy can best brief [LOC US  ] airlines on how they are affected by the [ORG GOI  ] policy . 
[ORG Singh  ] agreed to arrange the briefing . 
[ORG RSO  ] added that Continental particularly had asked the [ORG Civil Aviation Ministry  ] for this information but was only informed of the existence of a policy ( and not the elements of that policy ) . 
( NOTE: A [ORG GOI Civil Aviation  ] representative was slated to brief the [ORG CTJWG  ] but was unable to travel to [LOC Washington  ] to attend the meeting . 
End Note . 
) Before turning to a broader review of [LOC CT  ] training opportunities , [ORG RSO  ] noted that , pending a June 1 approval deadline , a [ORG DS/ATA Airport Security Consultation  ] is slated for June 26-30 . 
Making [ORG CT Training Smarter  ] -------------------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) After [ORG RSO  ] provided an update on [ORG ATA  ] courses for [LOC India  ] currently in the pipeline ( [ORG Para  ] 18 ) , [ORG Singh  ] passed to the [ORG DCM  ] a [ORG GOI  ] “wish-list” of [ORG ATA  ] courses ( [ORG Para  ] 19 ) and a list of courses the [ORG GOI  ] could offer to [ORG USG  ] law enforcement/military officers ( [ORG Para  ] 20 ) . 
[ORG RSO  ] pointed out that the [ORG Airport Security Consultation  ] could be used to bootstrap other related training , such as on travel document authentication. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Moving forward , [ORG RSO  ] asked for points of contact among [ORG GOI  ] subject-matter experts to identify course objectives ahead of time , to allow [ORG USG  ] training providers to modify courses ( where possible ) to meet [ORG GOI  ] objectives . 
[ORG RSO  ] noted the broad spectrum of [ORG USG  ] elements that would benefit by having this information . 
[LOC India  ] “Can’t Afford to Lag Behind” on Bio-Metrics --------------------------------------------- ---- <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( C ) [ORG Singh  ] raised the issue of bio-metrics cooperation , in which the [ORG GOI  ] “can’t afford to lag behind , ” he said . 
The NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00003611 004 OF 008 MEA’s [ORG Consular/Passports/Visas Division  ] coordinates with the [ORG Home Ministry  ] in this area . 
He underlined the role of document authentication in disrupting terrorist ( and other illicit ) travel and the transit of weapons and other contraband shipments . 
[ORG Singh  ] and the [ORG DCM  ] agreed on the importance of harmonizing document standards . 
The [ORG DCM  ] reminded [ORG Singh  ] that one problem the [ORG USG  ] has in repatriating [MISC Indian  ] nationals is the difficulty in verifying their identities ; the [ORG Embassy’s Consular Section  ] works with the [ORG Home Ministry  ] but bio-metrics may offer a solution . 
Streamlining Flow of [ORG Tactical Threat Information  ] --------------------------------------------- --- <a id='par12' href='#par12'>¶</a>12 . 
( C ) The [ORG DCM  ] underlined the importance of the Embassy ( through the [ORG RSO  ] ) being able promptly to inform [LOC US  ] businesses with equities in [LOC India  ] of “the ground truth” on terrorist threat information and terrorist attacks , including hoaxes . 
Stories periodically appear in the [MISC Indian  ] press that sensationalize alleged threats against [MISC American  ] interests . 
While these stories are often based on faulty information , they do serve to increase security concerns in the [MISC American  ] corporate community in particular . 
The [ORG DCM  ] explained the [ORG USG  ] “No Double Standard” and offered that [ORG GOI  ] sources and methods could still be protected under that policy . 
When [ORG Singh  ] asked how such incidents are handled in [LOC Washington  ] , [ORG RSO  ] informed him the [ORG DS Protective Liaison Division  ] keeps close contact with the diplomatic community . 
One [ORG DS Agent  ] typically services several diplomatic missions -- and is able to share tactical terrorist threat information on a real-time basis . 
[ORG Singh  ] concurred that such a service in [LOC India  ] is necessary beyond what state police agencies may provide , and suggested the [ORG MEA  ] , with inputs from the state police and [ORG Home Ministry  ] , would be the likely information provider . 
The [ORG DCM  ] then explained the function of the [ORG Embassy’s EAC  ] to evaluate imminent threat information and decide on an appropriate response , indicating how reliable real-time [ORG GOI  ] terrorist threat information would fit into the [ORG Embassy’s  ] decision-making process . 
[ORG Singh  ] agreed in principle to create a real-time response mechanism to disseminate [ORG GOI  ] terrorist threat information , with [ORG RSO  ] as the [ORG Embassy’s POC  ] . 
He saw this as important both to the diplomatic community and India’s growing pool of expatriate businesses. “No Complaints” on [MISC Intel Sharing  ] -------------------------------- <a id='par13' href='#par13'>¶</a>13 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [ORG Singh  ] reported that there were “no complaints” from [LOC Delhi  ] on [LOC US-India  ] intelligence sharing overall , and introduced [PER J/S Kumar  ] as a key contact for intel sharing . 
The [ORG DCM  ] concurred n the positive state of intelligence cooperation . 
He conveyed his understanding that earlier [LOC US  ] concerns in this area have largely been resolved . 
Continuing the Ideological Discussion ------------------------------------- <a id='par14' href='#par14'>¶</a>14 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) The [ORG DCM  ] and [ORG Singh  ] revisited the [ORG CTJWG  ] discussion on NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00003611 005 OF 008 combating extremist ideology particularly through the [MISC Internet  ] without leaving a [ORG USG  ] fingerprint . 
They agreed to schedule separate meetings to pursue this issue and explore how much can be accomplished and how best to do so . 
Future Meetings Planned ----------------------- <a id='par15' href='#par15'>¶</a>15 . 
( C ) In addition to issue-specific Embassy-GOI meetings to be held over the summer , [ORG Singh  ] said that he planned to meet [ORG S/CT  ] Ambassador Crumpton in September on the fringes of the [ORG UNGA  ] . 
The [ORG DCM  ] noted that Undersecretary [PER Nick Burns  ] plans to visit [LOC India  ] in late summer , which would offer an interim opportunity to review [LOC CT  ] progress , among other issues . 
Comment: Encouraging Signs Continue ----------------------------------- <a id='par16' href='#par16'>¶</a>16 . 
( C ) We are encouraged by the MEA’s continued receptivity to engage with us more deeply than in recent history on [LOC CT  ] issues . 
Barriers appear to be dissolving even regarding very sensitive issues , such as intelligence sharing and bio-terrorism preparedness . 
As far as the [ORG US-India CT  ] dialogue is concerned , Ambassador [ORG Singh  ] embodies the adage that “the right man in the right place at the right time can turn the tide.” He has yet to ensure the other actionable parts of the [MISC Indian  ] bureaucracy march in the same direction and to the same tune , but it is clear he is serious about making practical [LOC CT  ] cooperation work and serious about working with us to do so . 
Action Request for [ORG SCA  ] and [ORG S/CT  ] ------------------------------- <a id='par17' href='#par17'>¶</a>17 . 
( C ) Given the GOI’s expressed interest in “doing more” on the [ORG LTTE  ] ( Refs A and B and [ORG Para  ] 7 ) , Embassy requests further guidance from [ORG SCA  ] and [ORG S/CT  ] on moving in coordination with [ORG Delhi  ] against [ORG LTTE  ] finances and arms flows . 
We expect also to be queried about what steps the [ORG USG  ] is prepared to take against [ORG LTTE  ] fund-raising in the [LOC US  ] . 
[ORG ATA Courses In Train for India  ] 2006 ----------------------------------- <a id='par18' href='#par18'>¶</a>18 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Begin  ] list of [ORG ATA  ] courses for [LOC India  ] 2006: -- [ORG ATA-5345 Executive Course  ] on Cyber-Terrorism Duration: June 12-14 [ORG Location: Hyderabad Status: Offer  ] accepted -- [PER ATA-2994 Post-Blast  ] Investigation Duration: July 17-August 4 [ORG Location: Baton Rouge Status: Offer  ] accepted -- [ORG ATA-5062 India Senior Crisis Management Course  ] Duration: August 21-26 NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00003611 006 OF 008 [ORG Location: Washington Status:  ] Pending [ORG GOI  ] approval -- [ORG ATA-5956 Airport Security Consultation  ] Duration: June 26-30 [ORG Location: New Delhi  ] , [LOC Mumbai  ] , [LOC Hyderabad  ] , [ORG Jaipur Status:  ] Requested by the [ORG GOI  ] . 
Pending formal approval -- [ORG ATA-5737 India VIP Protection Course  ] Duration: August 7-25 [ORG Location: Baton Rouge Status:  ] Pending [ORG GOI  ] approval [ORG GOI  ] “Wish List” for [ORG CT Courses  ] --------------------------------- <a id='par19' href='#par19'>¶</a>19 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [PER Begin  ] lightly edited text of [ORG GOI  ] document “ATA Training Courses - Requirements of [MISC Indian  ] Police: Methodology and equipment for countering suicide bombing and fidayeen attacks .

-- How have these databases been built/developed ? 
-- What are the laws associated with the creation and access to these databases ? 
Experience Sharing: The most valuable input to agencies charged with the task of maintaining security is the experience of other such agencies . 
At the moment [LOC US  ] security forces are dealing with “rural” militancy in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and “urban” militancy in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
It is not necessary to send a large number of officers from [LOC India  ] . 
[LOC US  ] officers with appropriate experience could come to [LOC India  ] for 2-3 day sessions with [MISC Indian  ] officers . 
This idea is an extension of the cooperation between the defense forces of the two countries . 
We would thus suggest the following: Experience Sharing/Afghanistan: -- What were the problems faced in [LOC Afghanistan  ] at the strategic level ; at the tactical level ? 
-- What strategies evolved to resolve the problems ? 
-- How successful were the strategies and what were/are the problems faced in implementing the strategies ? 
-- What were/are the equipment used in these areas by the NEW [ORG DELHI  ] 00003611 007 OF 008 security forces ? 
-- In retrospect , what else could have been done ? 
Experience Sharing/Iraq: -- What were the problems faced in [LOC Iraq  ] at the strategic level ; at the tactical level ? 
-- What strategies evolved to resolve the problems ? 
-- How successful were the strategies and what were/are the problems faced in implementing the strategies ? 
-- What were/are the equipment used in these areas by the security forces ? 
-- In retrospect , what else could have been done ?
