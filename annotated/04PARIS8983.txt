[LOC France  ] ) 2004 OVERVIEW In 2004 , [LOC France  ] made progress in a number of areas that enhanced its already robust counter-terrorism capability . 
The [ORG Perben II  ] law entered into force on October 1 , ensuring domestic implementation of the [ORG European Arrest Warrant  ] and expanding the tools police , security and judiciary officials can use to combat terrorism . 
In April , [MISC French  ] authorities discovered and shut down a network of the [ORG Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group  ] that was considered to be extremely dangerous . 
In July , it took custody of four former detainees at [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] and charged them with terrorist conspiracy . 
All four of the detainees remain in pretrial detention and trials are expected to begin in 2005 . 
In October , [MISC French  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] authorities struck a significant blow to [ORG ETA  ] terrorism in their arrest in [LOC France  ] of two top [ORG ETA  ] leaders and in the seizure of significant arms and materials caches . 
With these and a number of other high profile arrests and convictions in 2004 , it is clear that [LOC France  ] continues its aggressive and effective anti-terrorist policies . 
Despite robust U.S.-French cooperation on counter-terrorism , [MISC French  ] officials continue to differ with the [LOC U.S.  ] on the impact of Operation [LOC Iraqi Freedom  ] on international terrorism , with [MISC French  ] officials suggesting that [LOC Iraq  ] , s liberation has made the world less safe and increased international terrorism . 
In 2004 , four [MISC French  ] nationals were identified as having been killed while fighting [ORG Coalition and Iraqi  ] forces in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES [LOC France  ] continues to be an active and engaged participant in the international war against terrorism . 
On the military front , its special forces participate in counter-terrorist operations in [LOC Afghanistan  ] and a [MISC French  ] admiral commands [ORG Task Force  ] 150 , a multinational naval force that patrols the [LOC Red Sea  ] and the [ORG Persian Gulf  ] to interdict the movement of suspected terrorists from [LOC Afghanistan  ] to the [LOC Arabian Peninsula  ] . 
At the political and diplomatic level , [LOC France  ] continues its engagement within the [ORG UN  ] , s [ORG Counter-Terrorism Committee  ] and the [MISC G-8  ] , s [ORG Counter-Terrorism Action Group  ] . 
[LOC France  ] is a party to all 12 international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism . 
In 2004 , [LOC France  ] expanded its cooperation in international judicial cooperation . 
With the entry into force of the [ORG Perben II  ] law , [LOC France  ] incorporated into its domestic legislation the provisions of the [ORG European Arrest Warrant  ] and strengthened its already extensive judicial and police powers to combat terrorism . 
For example , the law outlaws websites that post bomb-making instructions . 
In September , police shut down three such websites and arrested a computer science student for building one of them . 
In addition , [LOC France  ] signed with the [LOC United States  ] on September 2 two new agreements that updated a bilateral extradition treaty and improved overall counter-terrorism cooperation . 
[LOC France  ] and the [LOC Netherlands  ] were among the first [MISC European  ] countries to sign such agreements with the [LOC United States  ] . 
[LOC France  ] and the [LOC United States  ] continue to cooperate closely on border security issues , including airplane safety and the [ORG Container Security Initiative  ] . 
Possible threats to airplane flights during the 2003-2004 holiday season were investigated jointly by [LOC US  ] and [MISC French  ] authorities . 
[MISC French  ] police and security services have been very responsive to [LOC US  ] requests . 
In addition , [LOC France  ] is active internationally in proposing bioterrorism safeguards and nuclear facility safeguards . 
In March , the [LOC Paris  ] [ORG Prefecture of Police  ] announced the formation of a specialized , 90-person firefighting unit that would focus on combating nuclear , radiological , biological and chemical terrorist attacks . 
Also , in May , the [MISC French  ] government simulated a bomb attack on the [LOC Paris  ] metro to test the ability of emergency services to respond . 
On terrorism financing , [LOC France  ] continues to develop the competencies and capabilities of [LOC TRACFIN  ] , the [ORG Ministry of Finance  ] , s terrorism financing coordination and investigation unit . 
[LOC TRACFIN  ] has expanded the number of economic sectors it monitors within the [MISC French  ] economy , with a particular emphasis on institutions , non-governmental organizations and small enterprises suspected of having ties to [MISC Islamic  ] terrorism . 
At the level of the [ORG European Union  ] , [LOC France  ] plays an active role in the [ORG Clearinghouse  ] , the [ORG Union  ] , s terrorism financing coordination body . 
[LOC France  ] has designated as terrorist groups those that appear on the [ORG EU  ] list of terrorist organizations . 
As of yet , it has not designated [MISC Hamas-affiliated  ] charities , arguing that they have no links to terrorism . 
It also , along with its [ORG EU  ] partners , has not designated [MISC Lebanese  ] [ORG Hizballah  ] as a terrorist organization . 
[MISC French  ] authorities consistently condemn terrorist acts and have made no public statements in support of a terrorist-supporting country on a terrorism issue . 
Nevertheless , [LOC France  ] , along with its [ORG EU  ] partners , retains diplomatic relations with all of the governments designated as state sponsors of terrorism , with the exception of [LOC North Korea  ] . 
In 2004 it cosponsored with the [LOC United States  ] [ORG UN Security Council Resolution  ] 1559 , which targeted [MISC Syrian  ] domination of [LOC Lebanon  ] and called for dismantlement of armed groups and militias in [LOC Lebanon  ] and extension of [MISC Lebanese  ] government control throughout [MISC Lebanese  ] territory , to include areas under the de facto control of [ORG Hizballah  ] . 
DOMESTIC ACTIVITIES [LOC France  ] is perhaps best known for its seasoned and aggressive counter-terrorism police forces and judiciary . 
Within the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] , the DST ( internal security service ) , [ORG RG  ] ( police intelligence ) , [ORG DNAT  ] ( counter-terrorism brigade ) and Brigade Criminelle ( criminal investigations ) all play important roles in [MISC French  ] counter-terrorism work . 
In 2004 , as part of a move to improve cooperation among [LOC France  ] , s security services , a new terrorism coordination cell was created that will be based in the headquarters of the [LOC DGSE  ] , [LOC France  ] , s external intelligence service and part of the [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] . 
Personnel from the [ORG RG  ] and the DST will be part of the coordination unit . 
This new initiative adds another coordination body to an already crowded field . 
Other coordination mechanisms include UCLAT ( a counter-terrorism coordination unit with the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] ) , the [ORG SGDN  ] ( attached to the office of the Prime Minister ) , the [ORG Intelligence Council  ] and the [ORG Council  ] for [ORG Internal Security  ] ( attached to the office of the President . 
) There is virtually no legislative oversight of intelligence and security agencies . 
Terrorism investigations that may lead to criminal charges are handled by the counter-terrorism section of the [LOC Paris  ] Prosecutor , s office . 
Investigative judges , who in the [MISC French  ] system combine prosecutorial and judicial powers , concentrate on Islamic/international terrorism , Basque/ETA terrorism and terrorism linked to [MISC Corsican  ] separatist groups . 
Their mandate is extensive , and includes terrorist acts on [MISC French  ] soil and acts abroad that affect [MISC French  ] citizens . 
Their powers are substantial and they are given wide freedom to investigate . 
They cooperate closely with [MISC French  ] police and security services . 
Under [MISC French  ] law , terrorism suspects may be detained for up to 96 hours before charges are filed . 
In addition , suspects can be held for up to three and a half years in pretrial detention while the investigation against them continues . 
There is general public acceptance of these measures . 
[PER Olivier Roy  ] , a [MISC French  ] terrorism expert , told the [ORG Associated Press  ] on December 7 that &there , s a tradition in [LOC France  ] of a strong state and people want to have a strong state.8 Barring the revelation of serious abuses , there is little indication that [MISC French  ] citizens would want to decrease the extensive powers given to [MISC French  ] investigating judges , police and security services . 
[MISC French  ] police and intelligence services within the [ORG Interior Ministry  ] have extensive powers of surveillance , monitoring and administrative detention . 
These powers were enhanced with the March 9 passage of [ORG Perben II  ] ( with entry into force on October 1 ) and include expanded detention ( up to four days before charges must be brought ) , more authority for police to go undercover , warrants for searches at night , more leeway in granting document searches , and increased authority to wiretap . 
These expanded powers are to be used only in cases that involve investigation of organizations &that imperil society , 8 such as the mafia , drug traffickers and terrorist organizations . 
Even if government authorities are found to have misused their new powers , any evidence they have found would still be accepted in court . 
Judicial and police investigations following the high-profile arrests in 2003 of [MISC German  ] national [PER Christian Ganczarski  ] and [MISC Moroccan  ] national [PER Karim Mehdi  ] continued in 2004 . 
[PER Ganczarski  ] and [PER Mehdi  ] , who are suspected of ties to al-Qaida , remain in pretrial detention in [LOC France  ] . 
The investigation into the activities of suspected terrorist [PER Djamel Beghal  ] concluded in late 2004 . 
His trial , as well as the trials of seven associates , will begin January 3 , 2005 . 
The [PER Beghal  ] network is suspected of planning to commit a number of terrorist acts , including an attack on the [LOC US  ] Embassy in [LOC Paris  ] . 
[MISC French  ] police and judicial authorities arrested six suspected members of the [ORG Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group  ] ( [ORG GICM  ] ) on April 5 . 
An investigation into their activities is ongoing . 
The six suspects are being held in pretrial detention . 
The [ORG GICM  ] cell is thought to have provided logistical support to those who committed the attacks against [MISC Madrid  ] trains on March 11 . 
[MISC French  ] authorities also arrested five individuals in mid-November on charges of stealing one million euros from a Brinks delivery truck that restocked ATM machines . 
These individuals are suspected of having links with the [ORG GICM  ] cell . 
Judicial and police investigations are also continuing in the &Chechen network , 8 a loose grouping that is reported to have links with the [PER Beghal  ] network and the [LOC Frankfurt  ] network ( which attempted in 2000 to attack cultural sites in [LOC Strasbourg  ] , including the cathedral ) . 
Members of the [MISC Chechen  ] network reportedly were interested in using chemical agents to commit terrorist attacks . 
[MISC French  ] authorities arrested [PER Zinnedine Khalid  ] on June 14 , one of the suspected members of the [MISC Chechen  ] network . 
They also suspect that the [MISC Chechen  ] network may have links with a possible [MISC Asian  ] network that included [PER Lionel Dumont  ] , a [MISC French  ] citizen in custody who had lived previously in [LOC Japan  ] . 
The trial of ten suspected members of the [LOC Frankfurt  ] network began in [LOC Paris  ] on September 29 and is expected to last three months . 
In May , a [LOC Paris  ] court convicted two [MISC French  ] citizens , [PER Ahmed Laidouni  ] and [PER David Courtailler  ] , and an [MISC Algerian  ] citizen , [PER Mohamed Baadache  ] , for organizing recruitment networks for terrorist training camps in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
[PER Baadache  ] received the maximum sentence of 10 years under terrorist conspiracy laws . 
[PER Laidouni  ] was given 7 years , while [PER Courtailler  ] was given two years in jail along with a suspended two-year sentence . 
Following the July 27 transfer of four [MISC French  ] citizens detained at [LOC Guantanamo Bay  ] , [MISC French  ] authorities successfully argued in favor of their pretrial detention while judicial authorities are preparing cases that charge them with terrorist conspiracy . 
These arguments have withstood multiple appeals by defense lawyers and the detainees remain in pretrial detention . 
[LOC France  ] has been one of the most aggressive and proactive countries in prosecuting its citizens formerly held by the [LOC U.S.  ] at [LOC Guantanamo  ] . 
The [MISC French  ] government publicly condemned acts of terrorism targeting civilians in [LOC Iraq  ] on multiple occasions in 2004 . 
Nevertheless , throughout the year , [MISC French  ] government officials , including President [PER Chirac  ] , continued to assert publicly that the liberation of [LOC Iraq  ] had made the world less safe and increased international terrorism . 
These criticisms reflect broader [MISC U.S.-French  ] divergences on [LOC Iraq  ] policy in general . 
Four [MISC French  ] citizens have been identified in 2004 as killed while fighting in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
Amidst concerns that radical [MISC Islamists  ] with [MISC French  ] citizenship were beginning to enter [LOC Iraq  ] to fight [ORG Multinational  ] and [MISC Iraqi  ] forces and commit terrorist acts in [LOC Iraq  ] , the [LOC Paris  ] Prosecutor , s office opened an investigation into a possible network of [MISC Islamists  ] recruiting [MISC French  ] citizens to fight in [LOC Iraq  ] . 
That investigation is ongoing . 
On October 8 , an early morning bomb exploded in front of the [MISC Indonesian  ] Embassy in [LOC Paris  ] . 
No one was killed , although the bomb caused significant damage . 
[MISC French  ] authorities continue to investigate the bombing . 
However , responsibility for the investigation was transferred to the counter-terrorism section of the [LOC Paris  ] Prosecutor , s office , signifying that the [MISC French  ] government suspects terrorism as a motive . 
[MISC French  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] authorities have jointly made significant progress in combating [MISC Basque  ] separatist groups , including the [ORG ETA  ] . 
In early October , [MISC French  ] police arrested [PER Mikel Albizu Iriarte  ] and [PER Soledad Iparraguirre  ] , two suspected [ORG ETA  ] leaders . 
They also arrested at least sixteen other suspects , and seized money and hundreds of pounds of explosives . 
In 2004 , the [MISC French  ] and [MISC Spanish  ] governments have formed two joint investigative teams , one focusing on al-Qaida-related groups and the second focusing on [MISC Basque  ] separatist groups . 
Despite a truce announced in November 2003 by the main [MISC Corsican  ] separatist movements ) the [ORG FLNC Union of Combatants  ] ) the island continues to experience low-level terrorist activities . 
Examples include the bombing of selected commercial and symbolic sites , the machine-gunning of a local gendarmerie post in October , and a rocket attack against another gendarmerie post in May . 
No one was killed in these attacks , most of which occurred at night . 
According to [MISC French  ] authorities , there have been 76 explosions at police stations in [LOC Corsica  ] over the last three years . 
[MISC French  ] police arrested in November twelve of 14 suspected members of the &Clandestini Corsi8 group , which claimed responsibility for seven recent attacks targeting [MISC Corsican  ] residents of north [MISC African  ] ancestry . 
At the administrative level , [LOC France  ] continued its policy of expulsions for non-French citizens engaged in what the [MISC French  ] government considered activities that promote hate . 
In response to sermons from several [MISC Muslim  ] clerics determined to have threatened public order by calling for jihad , Parliament passed a law in July stating that a foreigner can be deported for publicly supporting acts of hatred , discrimination or violence against any specific person or group of persons . 
The highest profile expulsion in 2004 was that of [MISC Muslim  ] prayer leader [PER Abdelkader Bouziane  ] , who was first expelled to [LOC Algeria  ] in April , then returned to [LOC France  ] after an administrative court suspended that ruling . 
[PER Bouziane  ] , who had made widely publicized statements condoning wife beating , was expelled a second time on October 5 . 
In addition , [PER Midhat Guler  ] , a [MISC Turkish  ] mosque leader and accused leader of the extremist group &Kaplan , 8 was expelled on April 29 . 
Although expulsions have long been a favorite tool used by [MISC French  ] authorities , in 2004 they gained more prominence . 
Interior Minister [PER de Villepin  ] publicly stated he would make expulsion procedures faster and easier . 
In June , following the passage of a law giving new regulatory powers to the [ORG Conseil Superieur  ] d , Audiovisuel ( [ORG CSA  ] ) , [LOC France  ] , s [ORG FCC-equivalent  ] , the [ORG CSA  ] began sanctions proceedings against al-Manar , a [MISC Hezbollah-affiliated  ] satellite television station , and al-Alam , a satellite television station based in [LOC Iran  ] . 
The [ORG CSA  ] accused both stations of anti-Semitic programming , propaganda in favor of suicide bombings , and the diffusion of hate . 
The subsequent granting of a limited broadcast license to al-Manar on November 19 was controversial , and prompted Prime Minister [PER Raffarin  ] to declare that al-Manar was &incompatible with [MISC French  ] values.8 After reviewing al-Manar programming after it received its broadcast license , the [ORG CSA  ] again petitioned the [ORG Conseil  ] d , [LOC Etat  ] , [LOC France  ] , s highest administrative court , to ban the station . 
On December 13 , the [ORG Conseil  ] d , [ORG Etat  ] agreed with the [ORG CSA  ] , and ordered al-Manar off [MISC French  ] airwaves . 
In addition , [PER Raffarin  ] has asked the [ORG European Union  ] to weigh in on the issue of &non-European8 media and their broadcasting of programs that are incompatible with [MISC European  ] values concerning hate and anti-Semitism . 
It is clear that for many inside and outside the government , stations such as al-Manar and al-Alam pose a direct threat to [MISC French  ] values , and in addition , serve as a rear-guard action fighting the government , s efforts to disseminate these values . 
In February , the [MISC French  ] government banned satellite television station [PER Medya TV  ] from broadcasting in [LOC France  ] . 
[PER Medya TV  ] is affiliated with [PER PKK/Kongra Gel  ] , which is listed as a terrorist organization by the [ORG European Union  ] . 
Worries over the rise of radical [MISC Islam  ] in [LOC France  ] have prompted Interior Minister [PER Sarkozy  ] , followed by his successor , Interior Minister [PER de Villepin  ] , to propose a number of steps to combat this threat . 
Some , mentioned earlier , focus on better coordination between the many [MISC French  ] services that deal with terrorism . 
Other steps focus on the need to better integrate [LOC France  ] , s minority [MISC Muslim  ] population . 
[PER Villepin  ] stated December 7 that it was unacceptable that &of the 1200 imams who practice in our country , 75 percent are not [MISC French  ] and one-third do not speak our language.8 He proposed , among other things , the creation of a foundation to manage money destined for [MISC Muslim  ] groups in [LOC France  ] and offer greater transparency and oversight of overseas fundraising for [MISC Muslim  ] institutions in [LOC France  ] . 
According to the [ORG Ministry of Interior  ] , approximately 50 of 1,685 [MISC Muslim  ] places of worship are considered to have ties to radical [MISC Islam  ] .
