[ORG ASUNCION  ] 003 Classified By: Charge d'Affaires , a.i . 
[PER Michael J. Fitzpatrick  ] for reaso ns 1.4 ( b ) and ( d ) . ------- SUMMARY ------- <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) President [PER Lugo  ] , joined by two close confidants , frankly and amicably discussed with Charge January 5 current security issues , principally the [ORG Paraguayan People 's Army  ] 's [MISC New Year  ] 's Eve attack on an [ORG Army  ] outpost and the separate subsequent capture by police of stolen plastic explosives by [ORG Army  ] personnel ( refs A and B ) ; the U.S.-trained [ORG Joint Rapid Response Detachment  ] ( [ORG DCEI  ] ) and security cooperation ; and possible threats of violence against himself , or his ministers . 
While the President was not overly concerned that any of the incidents represented clear or immediate threats to the government , he clearly was unhappy with the lack of inter-agency cooperation among his ministers and ministries . 
[PER Lugo  ] 's posture during the meeting clearly indicated that he remains strongly supportive of [ORG USG  ] assistance to [ORG DCEI  ] , but , especially in the absence of his ministers , he remained his ( usual ) noncommital self . 
He did repeatedly commit , however , to have his government provide the Embassy with a written response as to the way forward on [ORG USG  ] support for the [ORG DCEI  ] , and perhaps even on [LOC US  ] security assistance more generally , by January 16 . 
END SUMMARY. ------------------------------------ [PER LUGO  ] ON EPP AND EXPLOSIVES THEFT ------------------------------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) President [PER Fernando Lugo  ] , [ORG Paraguayan National Anti-Drug Secretariat  ] ( [ORG SENAD  ] ) Minister [PER Cesar Aquino  ] , and informal advisor [PER Omar Castarino  ] discussed security issues January 5 with Charge and poloff ( notetaker ) in a cordial one-hour meeting in the President 's office . 
[PER Lugo  ] told Charge that he was pleased with the government 's initial response to the [ORG Paraguayan People 's Army  ] 's ( [ORG EPP  ] ) December 31 attack on an [ORG Army  ] outpost in [LOC Tacuati  ] , [LOC San Pedro Department  ] ( ref A ) . 
[PER Lugo  ] based his feedback on initial reports from the military detailing the deployment of 35 members of the Military 's [ORG Joint Rapid Response Detachment  ] ( [ORG DCEI  ] ) to [LOC Tacuati  ] to search for [ORG EPP  ] suspects . 
He was decidely not pleased , however , with the interagency bickering that the attack provoked among the police , military , prosecutors and various public officials as to who was in charge of responding to the overall situation. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) President [PER Lugo  ] told Charge he was convinced the [ORG EPP  ] was definitely not as large as the 300 members alleged in some reports . 
Rather , he said , it was a small group of known individuals ( 20-30 ) repeatedly committing the same illegal acts . 
" It , s the same people as always , " he said , those responsible for a series of high-profile kidnappings in recenter years , first as members of the armed wing of the [ORG Free Homeland Party  ] ( [ORG PPL  ] ) , and now as the [ORG EPP  ] . 
[PER Lugo  ] said there were reports that law enforcement had surrounded one [ORG EPP  ] member , and [PER Lugo  ] said he hoped that having a high-profile arrest by the end of the week would convince people of his genuine interest in shutting down the [ORG EPP  ] . 
( NOTE: [MISC Paraguayan  ] security forces have not yet apprehended any suspects in the [LOC Tacuati  ] attack ; additional military and police units , however , have since been sent into the area in the hopes of cornering or flushing out those involved . 
END NOTE . 
) [PER Lugo  ] also mentioned that the rural areas of the [LOC Concepcion/San Pedro  ] border area ( such as [LOC Tacuati  ] ) and the hilly areas of [ORG Paraguari Department  ] as the two most troubling areas for these types of security threats . 
He was troubled by , but convinced that , the [ORG EPP  ] was receving local support from narcotics traffickers ( including some large land holders in [LOC San Pedro  ] ) . 
He based that , he said , on his intimate knowledge of the area from his ( eleven ) years as Bishop in [LOC San Pedro  ] . 
[PER Lugo  ] estimated that the [ORG EPP  ] was not really a direct security threat to the nation but rather were stirring up trouble , scaring off legitimate investors , and providing an opportunity for many quarters to criticize the government -- and ultimately to trip him up. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Lugo  ] shared his concerns with Charge over that morning 's breaking news story -- the arrest of [ORG Army  ] personnel in possession of hundreds of pounds of C4 plastic explosives , possibly stolen from [ORG Paraguayan Army  ] depots . 
[PER Lugo  ] said he was convinced that the the three sergeants publicly implicted " would not dare " to steal the explosives and guns recovered on their own . 
He saw it more in the context of the [ORG Army  ] 's " traditional " involvement in black market arms trafficking -- and he said he expected that officers " with stars on their shoulderboards " were those really behind the incident . 
Charge committed [ORG USG  ] efforts to work closely with prosecutors to trace the origins and possible chain of custody to any of the materials seized . 
The President lamented lack of controls on the country 's stored munitions and the Charge reviewed September 's USG-assisted destruction activity which reduced by some 60 percent [LOC Paraguay  ] 's stores of ( often old/unstable munitions . 
The Pesident reiterated his concern for he lack of cooperation and coordination among the security forces , the police and prosecutors . 
[PER Castorino  ] told [PER Lugo  ] that a good model for just such coordination does indeed exist -- the [MISC DCEI.  ] ----------------- SUPPORT FOR [ORG DCEI  ] ? ----------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Charge and [PER Castorino  ] reviewed for the President the history and development of the [ORG DCEI  ] , noting that the [ORG DCEI  ] is tentatively scheduled to receive up to [MISC USD  ] 1.2 million in [ORG USG  ] assistance this year , including assistance for final round of selections and qualifications courses slated to start in March . 
( NOTE: The [ORG USG  ] has provided [MISC USD  ] 5 million in total assistance to [ORG DCEI  ] since December 2006 . 
END NOTE . 
) [PER Castorino  ] noted that had it not been for [ORG USG  ] support for standing up the [ORG DCEI  ] , the President would have been left without any rapid response capability at all -- like the [ORG DCEI  ] he had just ordered deployed . 
[PER Aquino  ] noted that the [ORG DCEI  ] had been very supportive of [ORG SENAD  ] by providing cross-training to liaison officers and logistical support during counter-narcotics operations . 
Charge noted that , in the end , it had been the [ORG USG  ] that paid for the gas and expenses for the [ORG DCEI  ] to deploy in response to the President 's orders that week . 
[PER Lugo  ] took that on board , and recalled favorably his November 18 visit to the [ORG DCEI  ] headquarters in [LOC Asuncion  ] and his field trip to [ORG Amambay Department  ] with Ambassador Ayalde to observe [ORG SENAD  ] and [ORG DCEI  ] jointly conduct counter-narcotics operations. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Charge told [PER Lugo  ] that the [MISC USG-Paraguayan  ] bilateral support effort for the [ORG DCEI  ] had been drafted , but never signed by the previous [MISC Paraguayan  ] administration . 
President [PER Lugo  ] asked why that had been the case . 
Charge explained the [ORG USG  ] had operated in good faith that we were responding to joint [MISC US-Paraguayan  ] priorities in helping stand up the [ORG DCEI  ] . 
President [PER Duarte  ] promised repeatedly to sign , but then took an increasingly anti-US stance as the [MISC Paraguayan  ] elections came closer . 
( [PER Lugo  ] laughed at that , as [PER Duarte  ] 's tactics had obviously failed . 
) Then we had to wait for those elections ; and then President [PER Lugo  ] 's inauguration ; and then his meeting with President [PER Bush  ] ; and then OUR elections and now the [LOC U.S.  ] inauguration.. . 
President [PER Lugo  ] laughed aloud again in apparent agreement as Charge suggested this really has to stop . 
Charge emphasized to [PER Lugo  ] that the [ORG USG  ] sought from his administration a written statement of support for the [ORG DCEI  ] to share with the incoming [MISC Obama  ] administration before the [ORG Embassy  ] could even consider recommending continued [ORG USG  ] support for [ORG DCEI  ] . 
Charge put this in the context of the larger questions that the new [ORG US Administration  ] would have: Where does [PER Lugo  ] wish to take [LOC Paraguay  ] ; where does he wish relations with the [ORG USG  ] to go ; and , specifically , where does he wish to take the relationship in terms of security and defense issues . 
[PER Aquino  ] and [PER Castorino  ] explained to [PER Lugo  ] that although the [ORG DCEI  ] is operating legally under [MISC Paraguayan  ] law and under the military 's [MISC Special Forces  ] division , it still needs to be codified in the law ( for instance , to ultimately take receipt of [MISC U.S.-provided  ] weapons ) and it needs its own line item in the official budget . 
( NOTE: Both [PER Aquino  ] and [PER Castorino  ] -- who seem to have [PER Lugo  ] 's ear , and seem to be among the select few he trusts -- were bullish about [ORG USG  ] support for [ORG DCEI  ] . 
[PER Castorino  ] told [PER Lugo  ] that Defense Minister [PER Bareiro  ] had been " playing games " with the [ORG USG  ] and with the President . 
They disparaged [PER Bareiro  ] as increasingly influenced by the [ORG Paraguayan Movement Toward Socialism  ] ( [ORG P-MAS  ] ) leader [PER Camilo Soares  ] and Vice Foreign Minister [PER Jorge Lara Castro  ] ( also viewed by many as an ideological leftist ) . 
END NOTE . 
) <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Charge provided [PER Lugo  ] a draft copy of a letter from Charge to Defense Minister [PER Bareiro  ] , requesting such a written affirmation of the [PER Lugo  ] administration 's support for [ORG DCEI  ] ( as first requested by the Ambassador of [PER Bareiro  ] in mid-December ) . 
[PER Lugo  ] read the letter closely , asked that [PER Aquino  ] and [PER Castorino  ] provide any suggested edits ( they had none ) . 
[PER Lugo  ] was relaxed and appeared supportive , but , in the end , was his usual non-committal self ( perhaps especially so regarding something possibly still in debate within his motley cabinet and circle of advisors ) . 
But he quickly told Charge to proceed to send the letter to his Defense Minister , with copies to the Foreign Minister and himself . 
( This was done shortly after the meeting . 
) At no time was it suggested that either the Foreign Minister or Defense Minister be made aware of the Charge 's discussion of this topic with the President . 
President [PER Lugo  ] committed at several points , however , to have a formal a response to the [ORG Embassy  ] from his government by the end of the following week ( i.e. , the Friday before the [LOC U.S.  ] Presidential inauguration/transition ) . 
( NOTE: Defense Minister [PER Luis Bareiro Spaini  ] responded January 8 to the [ORG Embassy  ] 's January 5 letter , thanking the [ORG Embassy  ] for also sharing the request with the President and the Foreign Minister -- the two people , he said , with whom he needed to first meet in order to prepare a more definitive response . 
END NOTE . 
) ----------------------------- POSSIBLE THREATS AGAINST [PER LUGO  ] ----------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Lugo  ] told Charge that his sister , [PER Mercedes  ] , had received several calls with information about possible attacks on himself or possibly one of his Ministers to occur around the time of [ORG Holy Week  ] ( March ) . 
While he still only had initial scraps of info ( from his traveling sister ) , [PER Lugo  ] said the threats appeared to be emanating from ex-military and/or ex-police ( and possibly narco- or criminal-tied syndicates ) -- not the [ORG EPP/Paraguayan People 's Army  ] . 
[PER Lugo  ] asked that the [ORG Embassy  ] share any information it receives regarding possible threats against [PER Lugo  ] ; as Charge and Ambassador had committed to do so even before he assumed office , Charge committed to bring forth any such threat information we may have . 
( NOTE: Charge subsequently asked [ORG Country Team  ] members to check for any possible information related to these threats , which we will then loop back to the Presidency -- even if only to say that we have no such information . 
END NOTE . 
) [PER Lugo  ] concluded by saying he did not wish to jump to conclusions and " connect the dots " that did not merit connecting ; he said he saw the [ORG EPP  ] attack , the weapons thefts and the possible threat info his sister was picking up as separate and unrelated items . 
The President seemed relaxed and comfortable throughout the meeting , and , as always , open to learning new information related to things he did not know much about . 
At no time did he indicate he was feeling defensive , insecure or rattled by any of the threat information. ------- COMMENT ------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) President [PER Lugo  ] was warm , welcoming , relaxed throughout the meeting . 
He conveyed the impression that he remains strongly supportive of [ORG USG  ] assistance to [LOC Paraguay  ] in general , and to the [ORG DCEI  ] , in particular . 
The timing of this meeting -- in the immediate wake of both the [ORG EPP  ] attack and the theft of military munitions -- was coincidental , though it may prove to be providential . 
Even though he was , in the end , positive yet non-commital ( as is his style , to the frustration of all around him ) , he clearly recognized: a ) All that the [ORG USG  ] has done for [LOC Paraguay  ] , b ) The need for some clarity of his government 's position , and c ) The need for his government to get back to us formally ( and with one common position ) ASAP .
