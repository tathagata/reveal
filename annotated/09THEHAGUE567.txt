THE HAGUE 0092 Classified By: [MISC Political-Economic  ] Counselor [PER Andrew Mann  ] for reasons 1.5 ( b , d ) . <a id='par1' href='#par1'>¶</a>1 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG SUMMARY: Post  ] requests a senior [ORG USG  ] official ( ideally [ORG NSA General Jones  ] ) engage [MISC Dutch  ] Finance Minister and [ORG Labor Party  ] leader [ORG Bos  ] in a pull-aside at the [LOC Pittsburgh  ] [MISC G20 Summit  ] to emphasize continued [MISC Dutch  ] participation in such fora is based on their active international role , not their economic/financial power . 
Post suggests a follow-up call by SRAP Amb . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] to Development Minister [PER Koenders  ] to make sure [ORG Bos  ] " " gets " " the message . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) After his July 14 meeting with the President , Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] understands the [MISC Dutch  ] were invited to the [LOC Pittsburgh  ] [MISC G20 Summit  ] because of their role in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , where they are viewed as a serious partner who shoulders their international responsibilities . 
Deputy Prime Minister , Finance Minister and [ORG Labor Party  ] leader [PER Wouter Bos  ] , however , believes the reasons the [MISC Dutch  ] are going to [LOC Pittsburgh  ] are ( 1 ) their participation in previous [MISC G20  ] meetings ; ( 2 ) their financial prowess ( 16th largest economy , 11th largest financial center , 6th largest development assistance provider ) ; and ( 3 ) their substantive views on and experience in international economics and finance . 
Comments by Crown Prince [PER Willem-Alexander  ] after his September 11 visit to the [LOC White House  ] that the President wants the [MISC Dutch  ] as permanent [MISC G20  ] members ( " " The President indicated that he truly values the [MISC Dutch  ] input " " ) re-enforced [PER Bos  ] 's position. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) Following USNATO Amb . 
[PER Daalder  ] 's visit ( ref A ) , senior [MISC Dutch  ] officials , including the Prime Minister 's Foreign Policy and [ORG Defense Advisor  ] Karl van [LOC Oosterom  ] , have repeatedly asked the Embassy to have a senior [LOC Washington  ] official convey to [PER Bos  ] the real reason for the [MISC Dutch  ] [ORG G20  ] invitation . 
They complain " " he just doesn't get it , " " reflecting the frustrations of the Prime Minister , Foreign Minister and Defense Minister , who support the [MISC Dutch  ] remaining in [LOC Afghanistan  ] post-2010. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) In late August , [ORG Bos  ] indicated to the Ambassador the [ORG Labor Party  ] would likely support an extension of [MISC Dutch  ] deployment in [LOC Afghanistan  ] after 2010 , but not in [LOC Uruzgan  ] ( ref B ) . 
He has not said so publicly or within his party , however , and the [ORG Labor Party  ] rank and file ( and the public at large ) are increasingly opposed to [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
Recent [ORG Task Force Uruzgan  ] fatalities led to heavy media coverage of a perceived decline in public support for the [LOC Afghanistan  ] mission and a questioning of [MISC Dutch  ] development efforts in [LOC Uruzgan  ] - " " what are we doing there ? 
" " Allegations of corruption during the recent presidential election are also generating concerns about whether [MISC Dutch  ] diplomacy efforts have yet borne fruit . 
[ORG Bos  ] 's failure to see the connection between the [MISC Dutch  ] NATO/ISAF involvement and its [MISC G20  ] participation could cause him to change his mind from likely supporting an [LOC Afghanistan  ] extension to opposing it . 
The [ORG Labor Party  ] is currently the hold-out in the three-party governing coalition for [ORG Cabinet  ] approval to extend the [MISC Dutch  ] deployment after 2010 . 
While [ORG Bos  ] is guided on the [LOC Afghanistan  ] issue by Development Minister [PER Koenders  ] ( a leading member of [ORG Bos  ] 's [ORG Labor Party  ] ) , the final decision will be [ORG Bos  ] 's to make. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) [ORG Post  ] believes a pull-aside for [ORG Bos  ] by a senior [ORG USG  ] official such as [ORG NSA General Jones  ] at the [MISC Pittsburgh Summit  ] would be beneficial . 
It would make [ORG Bos  ] aware of how important we view international leadership -- measured by a country 's actions across the board . 
A pull-aside would also demonstrate to Prime Minister [PER Balkenende  ] our support for his efforts to get [ORG Cabinet  ] approval of continued [MISC Dutch  ] deployment . 
We would suggest comments along the following lines: - We respect the [MISC Dutch  ] political system and know the upcoming decision on whether to continue deployment in [LOC Afghanistan  ] after 2010 is a difficult one . 
That decision is for the [MISC Dutch  ] to make , but we are ready to provide any information to assist with the [ORG Cabinet  ] 's decision. - We value [MISC Dutch  ] partnership - not only in [LOC Afghanistan  ] but in [ORG NATO  ] , the [ORG OSCE  ] and [ORG G20  ] - across the breadth of international issues and fora . 
The countries around the table in [LOC Pittsburgh  ] are not here just for their economic weight/views but because they are world leaders . 
There are a number of countries who sought a seat at this [MISC G20  ] table , but only countries with an understanding of their international responsibilities were invited. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S/NF  ] ) As a follow-up to the [MISC G20  ] pull-aside , we request SRAP Amb . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] call Development Minister [PER Koenders  ] to make sure [ORG Bos  ] got the message . 
We understand Amb . 
[PER Holbrooke  ] is interested in contacting [PER Koenders  ] now , but we recommend a later call to take into consideration the [MISC G20  ] pull-aside and other developments . 
For example , [ORG CENTCOM Commanding General Petraeus  ] will meet with senior [MISC Dutch  ] Members of Parliament September 21 . 
We will report on that discussion so it can inform both the pull-aside and Holbrooke/Koenders call .
