( C ) SUMMARY . 
Ref a reported on the strategic aspects of [LOC Brazil  ] , s new [ORG Defense Strategy  ] document , signed by President [PER Lula  ] on December 18 . 
While the main purpose of the strategy as written by the Minister for [ORG Strategic Planning  ] , was to place [LOC Brazil  ] , s military and defense sector in the framework of a broader vision of national development ( reported in ref a ) , the document also contains policy guidance for the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] and the three services that give a clearer view of how [ORG Defense Minister Jobim  ] and senior military leaders see these institutions developing over the next generation -- into a more flexible , modern force with joint operational capabilities . 
The restructuring of the [MISC Brazilian  ] military can be seen as a compromise between setting conditions for a its role in a broader plan for national development and the goal of having a modern , effective military . 
After more than twenty years outside the political mainstream , and twenty years of minimal resources , the [MISC Brazilian  ] military is now making a case for its modernization . 
As it does so , opportunities will exist for improving the [MISC U.S.-Brazil  ] security partnership . 
END SUMMARY . 
[ORG MINISTRY  ] OF DEFENSE ------------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( SBU ) In its nine-year history , the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Ministry of Defense  ] has been under resourced and has had difficulty in providing effective civilian control over the armed forces . 
The [ORG Defense Strategy  ] seeks to ameliorate this situation by calling for the employment of better-prepared civilian [ORG Ministry  ] officials in place of some of the military personnel who now predominate . 
The [ORG Ministry  ] will have the lead on developing implementing arrangements for the [ORG Defense Strategy  ] and is tasked with issuing instructions for the activities of the [ORG Armed Forces  ] during peacetime . 
The Strategy also recognizes the importance of the [ORG Armed Forces  ] becoming more " joint " in their operational capabilities and tasks the [ORG Ministry  ] with encouraging more inter-service cooperation . 
As noted in ref a , sources in the [ORG Defense Ministry  ] and [ORG Ministry for External Affairs  ] told [ORG Embassy  ] personnel that a principal reason for the delay in final approval of the strategy was to ensure inclusion of the services , comments . 
As the section on each service differs markedly in terms of focus and style from the others , it is likely that the interagency agreement reached to allow the strategy document to go forward was to add in services , submissions to the document . 
The chapters on the services all seek to make a case for increased resources and modernized equipment but are not always successful at spelling out the strategic vision for the potential security threats or contingencies to which many of the desired upgrades would respond . 
[ORG NAVY  ] ---- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) The [ORG Navy  ] is tasked with control of the seas and rivers and denying their use to potential adversaries . 
Its main tasks will be defense of oil facilities and ports and assistance against transnational criminals . 
COMMENT: There is , however , no information as to what possible threats to oil facilities the [ORG Navy  ] may be asked to counter , making it difficult , for example to evaluate the strategy , s assertion that a nuclear submarine would be necessary to meet the goal of protecting such facilities . 
END COMMENT . 
The strategy does recommend increased [ORG Navy  ] capabilities in two key areas: control of the rivers and power projection in support of peacekeeping . 
Noting that lack of effective control of the [LOC Amazon  ] and [LOC Parana  ] river systems undermines stability , the [ORG Navy  ] will seek more brown water assets , including patrol vessels and better reconnaissance capability . 
While [LOC Brazil  ] , s current peacekeeping effort is focused on [LOC Haiti  ] , there is an acknowledgement that [LOC Brazil  ] will have to take a great share of the global burden and should be able to deploy and support peacekeepers out of its immediate region. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) The [ORG Navy  ] , s wish list for equipment includes the expected nuclear powered submarines . 
( See ref b for discussion . 
) The [ORG Navy  ] also seeks patrol craft and air patrol capabilities that will be important to effective monitoring of coasts and river systems . 
Naval aviation is set to [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000035 002 OF 003 improve through acquisition of aircraft and aircraft carriers , although the strategy specifies that any naval aircraft should be produced in [LOC Brazil  ] . 
Finally , the [ORG Navy  ] is charged with improving its search and rescue capabilities , including the potential for international cooperation . 
[ORG ARMY  ] ---- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The [ORG Army  ] , s strategic instructions focus on restructuring to make the force more mobile and able to engage in non-traditional conflicts . 
To this end , the [ORG Army  ] plans to shift to a brigade model in order to have more deployable units available . 
These " rapid action forces " are intended to give commanders the ability to react to crises in remote areas with a flexible set of capabilities that can be tailored to the situation . 
In support of such missions , the [ORG Army  ] , s acquisition priorities will be improved reconnaissance and communications , helicopters , night vision and fire control technology . 
6 . 
( C ) While mentioned prominently elsewhere in the [ORG Defense Strategy  ] , the [ORG Army  ] chapter does not , unlike the other services , raise the possibility of additional peacekeeping operations as a future mission , possibly a reflection of the [ORG Army  ] , s frustration with the lack of an exit strategy in [LOC Haiti  ] . 
The [ORG Army  ] , s planning is also silent on the major new task it will have in training up to three million potential reservists per year should the strategy , s national service provisions be fully implemented . 
[ORG AIR FORCE  ] --------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Apart from the highly prescriptive section on fighter procurement discussed in ref a , the [ORG Air Force  ] chapter focuses on how to meet challenges in joint operations , reconnaissance and communications . 
The [ORG Air Force  ] , s highest priority , aside from new fighters , will be on acquiring more airlift capability so that one of the [ORG Army  ] , s new brigades can be deployed rapidly at any time . 
Other priorities include [MISC UAVs  ] and improved satellite capability , particularly through indigenous space launch . 
These priorities are underlined by a clear directive to favor domestic industry where possible . 
The capability to build aircraft ( including [MISC UAVs  ] and space launch vehicles ) in [LOC Brazil  ] is considered " so important as to transcend discussions of equipment , " a policy of sacrificing capability in favor of domestic production . 
COMMENTS -------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) As with the rest of the [ORG Defense Strategy  ] , the sections on restructuring of the [MISC Brazilian  ] military are a compromise between setting conditions for a military role in a broader plan for national development and the goal of having a modern , effective military . 
After more than twenty years outside the political mainstream , and twenty years of minimal resources , the [MISC Brazilian  ] military is now making a case for its modernization . 
Making the case , however , means that the [ORG Defense Strategy  ] must observe the conventional wisdom of [MISC Brazilian  ] politics . 
There is no threat , for example , to [LOC Brazil  ] , s maritime oil deposits , but [MISC Brazilian  ] leaders and media have routinely cited oil discoveries off the coast as an urgent reason for better maritime security . 
This concern has been merged with [LOC Brazil  ] , s twenty year quest to develop a nuclear submarine to give new impetus to research on a small reactor for naval propulsion . 
While the [ORG Army  ] chapter of the strategy includes the seemingly mandatory caution about being prepared to protect [LOC Brazil  ] , s sovereignty against a country or group of countries acting " on pretext of the supposed interests of humanity , " it remains primarily focused on more realistic security challenges . 
The political preoccupation with imagined threats to sovereignty in the [LOC Amazon  ] , however , serves the practical purpose of tasking the military with developing greater capabilities to project power into the region most likely to be affected by instability in neighboring countries. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) A [MISC Brazilian  ] military that is more capable and deployable can support [LOC U.S.  ] interests by exporting stability in [LOC Latin America  ] and be available for peacekeeping elsewhere . 
The plans by the [MISC Brazilian  ] services , as evidenced in those parts of the defense strategy likely contributed by the services , are consistent with this interest , and , if implemented , will lead to [LOC Brazil  ] becoming a more effective security partner . 
There are however , serious questions as to how much of these plans will see follow through , particularly with other supposed strategic priorities , including national service , nuclear submarines and government support to non-competitive defense industries , providing black holes to suck in all available resources .
