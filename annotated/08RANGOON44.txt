End Summary . 
[MISC Chinese  ] Fed Up -------------- <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Guan Mu  ] no longer tries to defend the regime as making any progress on political dialogue . 
He admitted that he did not know why the dialogue apparently stopped last November , although he added that some in the senior leadership understand that they must open up to the outside world . 
He acknowledged that accurate information about the current situation does not get passed up to the senior levels . 
Although claiming that it was un-Buddhist for monks to become involved in politics , [PER Guan  ] agreed that the monks’ involvement indicated how bad the situation had become in [LOC Burma  ] . 
He pointed out the designated liaison officer met with [PER Aung San Suu Kyi  ] last week after a two-month hiatus , but quickly admitted that this gap was “too long.” Charge pointed to Senior General [PER Than Shwe  ] as the main obstacle to moving forward . 
The Ambassador responded that he believed that [PER Than Shwe  ] would be ready to open up in a few more years . 
The [MISC Burmese  ] people can’t wait that long , the Charge warned , stressing that further delays would only increase the possibility of further turmoil. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) Ambassador [PER Guan  ] stated the various [MISC Chinese  ] officials traveling to [LOC Burma  ] have counseled the senior generals to speed up the political dialogue and warned them that the international community would not accept any backtracking . 
He agreed that the various parties just needed to start talking , and urged us to offer positive , constructive comments . 
Charge said “start talking now” was very constructive advice , and real dialogue would be welcomed by the whole world . 
If the generals were serious about a dialogue , they should be meeting everyday , not just with [PER Aung San Suu Kyi  ] , but with ethnic leaders , and other interested citizens as well . 
A one hour meeting with one person after two months was just for show , claimed the Charge , not serious . 
In addition , she continued , the regime has not permitted ASSK to meet with anyone else . 
The regime should be easing the restrictions on her , so she can get advice and counsel from a wide variety of people . 
Control vs. Turmoil ------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) [PER Guan  ] cited two concerns that might be hindering the political dialogue from getting started: losing power and economic interests . 
[PER Guan  ] suggested , if the senior leaders could be offered assurances that they would not “lose their lives” and could keep their economic interests , they might be more amenable to ceding power gradually . 
He implied that the economic interests were of higher priority for the generals and their families . 
Charge replied that this could all be negotiated , reiterating the need to get started now . 
If turmoil breaks out as people’s frustration continues to grow , there might be nothing left to negotiate , she added. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) The generals want to stick to their roadmap , stated [PER Guan  ] . 
Charge suggested that they could still call it a roadmap while increasing participation at each of the remaining steps , including the current constitution drafting . 
Even though this might slow the roadmap process , she said it could produce more broadly accepted results in the end , which would be better for all . 
The roadmap process as it is will RANGOON 00000044 002 OF 003 not deliver the stability that everyone wants to see , the Charge said , because it does not incorporate provisions the pro-democracy supporters and ethnic minorities want to see . 
Instead of taking credit for speeding up the roadmap as he has in previous meetings , [PER Guan  ] nodded in agreement . 
He repeated the [MISC Chinese  ] interest in stability . 
Charge said more demonstrations were likely in the coming months if the people saw no signs a genuine dialogue was underway . 
She expressed confidence that many issues could be easily resolved , if the various parties just started talking and kept talking. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) [PER Guan  ] acknowledged that the regime has done nothing to improve the lives of the [MISC Burmese  ] people , even though they recieved increased oil and gas revenues . 
He recognized that the huge increase in satellite fees will further turn the public against the military . 
Charge characterized the latter as an attempt to keep people from the news , but also effectively blocking them from some of their few escapes--soccer and [MISC Korean  ] soap operas . 
[PER Guan  ] mentioned that [LOC China  ] had learned that when the government tried to press down too hard , it increased the likelihood of an eruption ; he understood the risks of more turmoil in [LOC Burma.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) [PER Guan  ] questioned whether democracy could work in [LOC Burma  ] citing the experience of their first decade of independence and [PER Ne Win’s  ] efforts to promote a democratic transition in 1988 . 
[PER Charge  ] explained that many nations went through the same struggles after independence , and reminded [PER Guan  ] that it was the current generals who blocked a transition in 1988 . 
The [MISC Burmese  ] have learned from the past , according to the Charge , if they have a voice in deciding their political future then they will have an interest in maintaining stability . 
[PER Guan  ] said there were some issues that were inappropriate for outsiders to decide , like sexual problems in a family . 
Charge agreed saying the role of the outsiders should be in persuading the parties to talk ; what they talked about and the decisions they came to was up to them . 
[PER Charge  ] urged [LOC China  ] to join with the [LOC U.S.  ] in urging genuine talks get started now and keep going until a more broadly acceptable way forward can be agreed upon by all the relevant parties of [LOC Burma  ] . 
Meet the [ORG USDA  ] , not the [ORG NLD  ] -------------------------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) [PER Charge  ] noted that the most recent [MISC Chinese  ] visitor had spent a lot of time with [ORG Union Solidarity and Development Association  ] ( [ORG USDA-the  ] regime’s mass member organization ) members . 
[PER Guan  ] described He [MISC Luli  ] as a senior official from one of [MISC China’s  ] eight political parties , and of the [ORG People’s Congress  ] . 
[PER Guan  ] did not believe that her meetings meant [ORG USDA  ] was preparing to formally become a political party . 
He noted that while [ORG USDA  ] claimed 24 million members , 60% were under the age of 18 , so could not vote . 
[PER Charge  ] asked if the He met with the [ORG National League of Democracy  ] ( [ORG NLD  ] ) , and [PER Guan  ] quickly replied that the “government would not permit that , ” referring to the [MISC Burmese  ] government. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) [PER Charge  ] mentioned that the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] had complained that we visited [ORG NLD  ] “excessively” and asked if the [MISC Chinese  ] had been called in . 
He smiled , shook his head no , and asked if [PER Charge  ] visited [ORG NLD  ] . 
Yes , she replied , adding she would be pleased to introduce the Ambassador to [ORG NLD  ] members . 
He said he received a letter from U [PER Aung Shwe  ] , the [ORG NLD  ] Chairman , requesting a meeting , had not scheduled anything , but shook their hands when he encountered them at [ORG National Day  ] receptions . 
He noted that the [ORG Foreign Ministry  ] did not prohibit [PER Charge  ] from seeing [ORG NLD  ] , just advised against too many visits . 
[PER Charge  ] said we would go on meeting with [ORG NLD  ] regularly since they were always willing to talk with us , unlike the government . 
[PER Guan  ] stated that [MISC Chinese  ] officials had recommended to senior leaders that they meet with [PER Charge  ] , and said [PER Than Shwe  ] had told the [MISC Chinese  ] Vice Foreign Minister that he would. <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( C ) Comment: The [MISC Chinese  ] clearly are fed up with the footdragging by the [PER Than Shwe  ] regime . 
While democracy , demonstrations , and politically active monks make them nervous , they recognize that the risks of further turmoil are RANGOON 00000044 003 OF 003 increasing so long as the generals refuse to talk . 
This turmoil will inevitably affect [MISC Chinese  ] business interests here , making them more amenable to our approaches regarding [LOC Burma  ] in the interests of promoting stability . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] can no longer rely on the generals to protect their interests here , and recognize the need to broker some solution that keeps the peace , including bringing in the pro-democracy supporters . 
Those discussions need to get started now . 
The generals no doubt fear for their futures , so some quiet assurances of protection might help bring them to the negotiating table . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] share our desire to get them to the negotiating table . 
The [MISC Chinese  ] Ambassador has made clear his continuing interest in working together with us .
