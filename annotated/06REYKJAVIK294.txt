END SUMMARY . 
2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Ministry for [ORG Foreign Affairs  ] officials have confirmed to post that [LOC Iceland  ] has no plans to withdraw its peacekeepers from the [ORG Nordic-run Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission  ] ( [ORG SLMM  ] ) following the withdrawal last month of the [MISC Swedish  ] , [MISC Danish  ] and [MISC Finnish  ] [ORG SLMM  ] contingents after the Liberation Tigers questioned the [ORG EU  ] 's neutrality . 
[LOC Iceland  ] currently has five personnel assigned to the [ORG SLMM  ] , now staffed only by [MISC Norwegians  ] and Icelanders after the withdrawal of personnel from the three [ORG EU  ] member states. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Acting Director of the [ORG Iceland Crisis Response Unit  ] ( [ORG ICRU  ] ) [PER Thorbjorn Jonsson  ] told [ORG Poloff  ] August 2 that the [ORG GOI  ] intends to stay the course in [LOC Sri Lanka  ] and may expand its [ORG SLMM  ] staffing if the mission is unable to recruit new states as participants ( [PER Jonsson  ] specifically mentioned [LOC Australia  ] , [LOC New Zealand  ] , and [LOC Singapore  ] as possible contributors ) . 
On August 8 , Advisor to the Foreign Minister [PER Jorundur Valtysson  ] told [ORG Poloff  ] that the [ORG ICRU  ] would " more than likely " send an additional five Icelanders to [LOC Sri Lanka  ] , but that a final decision would depend on consultations between [MISC Icelandic  ] Foreign Minister [PER Valgerdur Sverrisdottir  ] , her [MISC Norwegian  ] counterpart ( expected here on August 14 ) , and [LOC Sri Lanka  ] Special Envoy [PER Jon Hanssen-Bauer  ] ( due here August 18 ) . <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The [ORG EU  ] members' withdrawal , however , has raised the mission 's profile considerably here , and sparked questions in the media regarding the appropriateness of continuing [LOC Iceland  ] 's participation , let alone expanding it . 
[PER Jonsson  ] and [PER Valtysson  ] both dismissed increasingly skeptical coverage - including an August 2 editorial in leading daily [PER Morgunbladid  ] suggesting that [LOC Iceland  ] should call its monitors home - as the product of " slow news days " at the height of summer holiday season . 
Prime Minister [PER Geir Haarde  ] has said that no decision had been taken and that it might even be necessary to withdraw [LOC Iceland  ] 's monitors from the mission. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The killing of 17 humanitarian workers in [LOC Sri Lanka  ] on August 6 has given the story new legs . 
[PER Morgunbladid  ] , expanding on its earlier doubts , questioned in an August 9 editorial whether Icelanders should take part in any military-related peacekeeping operations anywhere given that [LOC Iceland  ] , as a country without its own military , " has not trained people to work in areas where military attacks can happen without warning . 
" The editorial revived criticism of [MISC Icelandic  ] civilian peacekeepers in [LOC Afghanistan  ] , whose penchant for carrying arms and wearing battle dress uniform has in the past led [MISC Icelandic  ] media and politicians to debate the existential question of when does a peacekeeper become a warrior. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) [MISC Comment:  ] Absent a direct attack on [ORG SLMM  ] personnel before Hanssen-Bauer 's August 18 visit here , we expect the [ORG GOI  ] to proceed with its plans to expand [MISC Icelandic  ] participation in the mission . 
However , given current media attention , the death or injury of an [MISC Icelander  ] in [LOC Sri Lanka  ] could have a grave impact on the [ORG GOI  ] 's stated plans to double its peacekeeping participation by 2008 .
