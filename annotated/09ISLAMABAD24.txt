( [ORG S  ] ) Summary: President [PER Zardari  ] told the Ambassador January 2 he would have no choice but to respond militarily to an [MISC Indian  ] attack .

End summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Ambassador called on President [PER Zardari  ] January 2 to discuss follow-up to the [LOC Mumbai  ] investigation . 
[PER Zardari  ] said he had been briefed by Lt. General [PER Pasha  ] on his meeting with [ORG DCIA  ] , and he had approved the release of “tearline” information to the [MISC Indians  ] . 
He wanted to emphasize he ( and General [PER Kayani  ] ) were fully committed to better relations with [LOC India  ] . 
He reminded the Ambassador that it had only taken a “phone call” from the [LOC U.S.  ] to ensure that [LOC Pakistan  ] did not oppose the [LOC U.S./India  ] civil nuclear deal at the [ORG Nuclear Suppliers Group  ] . 
[PER Zardari  ] emphasized he had no problem making decisions , recalling that we had asked him to refuse the release of detainees in the context of “peace deals” when the [ORG Army  ] and [ORG ISI  ] were pressing to do so . 
But he said there was no way that he could let [LOC India  ] attack [MISC Pakistan:  ] many in the [LOC West  ] did not understand the importance of [LOC Kashmir  ] in [MISC Pakistani  ] public opinion. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) [PER Zardari  ] indicated clearly that he was disinclined to repeal with 17th amendment ( which gives the President the power to appoint the service chiefs , judges , and the Election Commissioner . 
) He justified this on the grounds that the initiative had to come from parliament . 
( [PER Nawaz Sharif  ] lately has been pressing [PER Zardari  ] to fulfill his electoral commitment to repeal this amendment , which codified [ORG Musharraf’s Legal Framework Order  ] . 
) <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Zardari  ] said that he was increasingly losing patience with [PER Nawaz Sharif’s  ] government in the [LOC Punjab  ] , and he believed that a confrontation was looming . 
He said that [MISC Pakistani  ] Muslim League-Nawaz Chief Minister [PER Shabbaz Sharif  ] had tipped off the [ORG JUD  ] about the [ORG UNSCR  ] 1267 mandated asset freeze , resulting in almost empty bank accounts . 
( Information from MOI does indicate that bank accounts contained surprisingly small amounts . 
) [PER Zardari  ] suggested [ORG Lahore Principal  ] Officer might mediate between the [ORG Pakistan People’s Party  ] ( [ORG PPP  ] ) Governor and [PER Shabbaz Sharif  ] who increasingly are publicly at odds . 
Ambassador noted that his government had been “holding over [ORG Nawaz’s  ] head” the [ORG Supreme Court’s  ] decision on [ORG Nawaz’s  ] eligibility to run for office . 
[PER Zardari  ] replied , “yes , but it doesn’t seem to be doing much good anymore.” [PER Zardari  ] dismissed [ORG Nawaz’s  ] ability to bring crowds into the street in the [LOC Punjab  ] if his party was removed from the [LOC Punjab  ] government. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) Ambassador and [PER Zardari  ] discussed [LOC U.S.  ] assistance issues , particularly in regard to upcoming visits of [ORG A/S Boucher  ] and [PER CODEL Reed  ] . 
As usual , [PER Zardari  ] asked for additional support , particularly to fund additional police in [LOC FATA  ] and [ORG NWFP  ] , which could hold territory after the army and the [ORG Frontier Corps  ] moved out . 
He said that he needed 100,000 police in each province . 
( There are now 48,000 police in [ORG NWFP  ] . 
) And he needed equipment quickly . 
He said that he was going to ask us to reprogram some of our funding , since “without security , none of the other programs matter.” <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Zardari  ] confirmed again at the end of the conversation that [LOC Pakistan  ] would not allow non-state actors to dictate state policy , but that the [MISC GOP  ] would respond if the [MISC Indians  ] attacked . 
He recommended a report done in [LOC India  ] which indicated that [MISC Indian  ] Muslims are treated poorly and are among the least prosperous members of society . 
He said that the [ORG Bharatiya Janata Party  ] ( [ORG BJP  ] ) was trying to whip up anti-Muslim sentiment . 
Morever , there were plenty of extremist groups in [LOC India  ] that could have assisted [MISC Lashkar-e-Taiba.  ] <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Ambassador asked about Swat . 
He said flatly they did not have the troops to hold it . 
Ambassador asked the status of [PER Asfandyar Wali Khan  ] , the head of [ORG Awami National Party  ] , who was ostensibly in charge of the [ORG NWFP  ] government . 
[PER Zardari  ] just rolled his eyes. <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG S  ] ) [PER Zardari  ] said his trip to [LOC Afghanistan  ] had been rescheduled for January 7 . 
He laughed about the rumors that civilian military struggles in [LOC Pakistan  ] had prompted the delay . 
In truth , he said , he did not like to fly in bad weather , and he was worried about security . 
Ambassador had asked Interior Minister [PER Rehman Malik  ] several times about the status of [PER Brahamdagh Bugti  ] who is in exile in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
( Readers will recall that the status of [PER Mr. Bugti  ] was a major bilateral irritant between [LOC Afghanistan  ] and the [PER Musharraf  ] government , since [PER Musharraf  ] wanted [PER Bugti  ] “deported” to [LOC Pakistan  ] by [PER Karzai  ] to “face justice” for participation in separatist activities . 
) [PER Zardari  ] said he was going to ask [PER Karzai  ] to keep him in [PER Afghanistan: Bugti  ] was now involved in conflicts for supremacy in his tribe . 
[PER Zardari  ] said that government was drafting legislation to give the [MISC Balochis  ] more autonomy and political control .
