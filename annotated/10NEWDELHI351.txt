End Summary. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Senator [PER Kerry  ] ( [ORG D-MA  ] ) and Ambassador [PER Roemer  ] met with [MISC Indian  ] Foreign Secretary [PER Rao  ] on February 15 for forty-five minutes for a wide-ranging discussion of upcoming [MISC Indo-Pakistan  ] talks , [LOC Afghanistan  ] , implementing the [ORG U.S.-India  ] civil nuclear agreement , defense sales and climate change . 
The [MISC Senator’s  ] talks with Prime Minister [PER Singh  ] , [ORG National Security Advisor Menon and Defense  ] Minister [PER Antony  ] will be reported septel . 
Senator [PER Kerry  ] was accompanied by [ORG Senate  ] Foreign Relations Committee staffers [PER Jonah Blank  ] and [PER Fatema Sumar  ] and military escort LCDR [PER Greg Kausner  ] . 
MEA Joint Secretary ( [ORG Americas  ] ) [PER Gaitri Kumar  ] joined the Foreign Secretary . 
[MISC Indo-Pakistan  ] Talks Still On ---------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( C ) After expressing his condolences over the February 13 terrorist bombing in [LOC Pune  ] , Senator [PER Kerry  ] focused on the proposed talks between Foreign Secretary [PER Rao  ] and her [MISC Pakistani  ] counterpart , now scheduled for February 25 . 
[PER Kerry  ] stressed [LOC U.S.  ] interest in and support for the talks and noted that there was a long history of distrust to overcome . 
He noted he would be meeting with the [MISC Pakistani  ] leadership later on February 15 and pressed [PER Rao  ] for her sense of where the talks were heading. <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) FS [PER Rao  ] underlined that support for moving ahead with the talks came from Prime Minister [PER Singh  ] and that he remained strongly committed to dialogue with [LOC Pakistan  ] despite incidents such as the November 2008 [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks . 
She explained that the PM had to take public opinion into account , which had worn thin after [LOC Mumbai  ] , so there had been a pause in talks for the past 15 months . 
Responding to Kerry’s question about what the [MISC GOP  ] needed to do to make such talks productive , [PER Rao  ] said that a helpful environment could be created if [LOC Pakistan  ] took steps to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure . 
She recognized there had been progress through some arrests and through the [MISC Pakistani  ] trial of seven accused in the [LOC Mumbai  ] attacks , although the trial would move forward slowly because of [ORG Pakistan’s  ] complicated domestic problems . 
At the same time , terrorist camps still remained open ; infiltration over the [ORG Line of Control  ] had seen an unseasonable increase during the winter ; LeT and [ORG JuD  ] leaders like [PER Hafiz Saeed  ] had threatened [LOC India  ] with jihaad at large public rallies ; and [MISC GOP  ] rhetoric against [LOC India  ] was on the rise . 
[LOC India  ] wanted to see concrete steps to dismantle these structures. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) FS [PER Rao  ] was careful to note that it would take some time to move from the latest round of talks to the formal [ORG Composite Dialogue  ] between [LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] that had been paused following [LOC Mumbai  ] . 
Such talks “can’t just be switched on” and [LOC India  ] needed “a climate of confidence” in order to proceed to a resumption of the full dialogue . 
She speculated that [MISC Pakistani  ] COAS General [PER Kayani  ] was likely to tell the Senator that [MISC India’s  ] military doctrine continued to pose a threat to [LOC Pakistan  ] and observed that the [MISC Pakistani  ] military was “hypnotically obsessed” with [MISC India’s  ] military posture [ORG NEW DELHI  ] 00000351 002 OF 003 despite constant reassurances from [LOC India  ] about its intentions . 
No [LOC U.S.  ] Help Needed on [MISC Peace Talk Process  ] ---------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Kerry  ] asked if there were ways the [LOC United States  ] could engage differently that would support the talks , perhaps through a regional approach that offered security guarantees with other interested states that would promote stability . 
[PER Rao  ] urged that the [LOC U.S.  ] use it “enormous power” to encourage [LOC Pakistan  ] to move forward in a productive way to create a positive climate for discussions . 
On process , [PER Rao  ] assured [PER Kerry  ] that [LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] had established bilateral processes that should be used . 
As to Kerry’s suggestion of a regional approach that also involved outside powers , [PER Rao  ] said her instinctive reaction was that [LOC India  ] and [LOC Pakistan  ] needed to engage more effectively to create a level of trust that would support bilateral talks first . 
[LOC Afghanistan  ] ---------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) Senator [PER Kerry  ] stressed that the [LOC U.S.  ] was serious about its commitment to the region and that there were different possibilities for success than there had been even six months ago . 
He assured [PER Rao  ] that the July 2011 date to begin withdrawal of combat forces from [LOC Afghanistan  ] would not end [LOC U.S.  ] commitment in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
The date was intended to bring leverage to bear on [MISC Afghan  ] officials to make necessary reforms . 
On the [MISC Pakistani  ] side of the border , a change was needed in the dynamics of how a fragile [MISC Pakistani  ] civilian government and its strong military interacted with groups such as the [ORG Quetta Shura  ] and [PER Haqqani  ] . 
[PER Rao  ] stressed [MISC India’s  ] commitment to its reconstruction efforts in [LOC Afghanistan  ] . 
She criticized [MISC Pakistani  ] attempts to try to exclude [LOC India  ] from regional discussions of [LOC Afghanistan  ] and dismissed [MISC GOP  ] criticism of [MISC India’s  ] presence in consulates in [LOC Jalalabad  ] and [LOC Kandahar  ] , noting the consultates had originally been established in the fifties and were carrying out normal consular responsibilities . 
[ORG Civil Nuclear Agreement  ] , [ORG Clean Energy  ] , Climate Change ---------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Senator [PER Kerry  ] urged that the [ORG U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Agreement  ] be fully implemented , noting that there had been questions raised in [LOC Washington  ] about delays in moving forward . 
[PER Rao  ] assured him that the [ORG GOI  ] recognized the necessity of coming to closure and said that nuclear liability legislation was being “further refined” and it would be ready for the next session of Parliament which opens on February 22 . 
[PER Kerry  ] stressed that the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC India  ] could work together and become leaders in the field of alternative energy and [PER Rao  ] pointed to a bilateral [ORG MOU  ] signed in November 2009 as supporting such cooperative efforts. <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) Referring to the [LOC Copenhagen Summit  ] , FS [PER Rao  ] said it was positive that agreement had been reached , but noted that the Accord was not a legally binding agreement . 
She expressed concern that pending climate change legislation in the [ORG U.S. Congress  ] might include trade-related provisions . 
Senator [PER Kerry  ] reassured her that there was no intention to act in a unilateral or punitive fashion , but noted that an agreement among the largest emitters could not be sustained if there was no enforcement mechanism . 
Legislation in [ORG Congress  ] needed to address that possibility in order to be politically sustainable . 
Military Sales and [ORG Export Controls  ] ----------- <a id='par10' href='#par10'>¶</a>10 . 
( [ORG SBU  ] ) The Senator encouraged [LOC India  ] to consider bids by [ORG Boeing  ] and [ORG Lockheed Martin  ] in the competition to award a contract for fighter aircraft purchases . 
[PER Rao  ] assured [PER Kerry  ] that [LOC India  ] was open-minded and was using open and transparent procedures . 
She hailed the increase in defense cooperation [ORG NEW DELHI  ] 00000351 003 OF 003 as measured by increased [LOC U.S.  ] defense sales , while noting that liberalization of export controls was a necessity if both sides wanted the relationship to grow further. <a id='par11' href='#par11'>¶</a>11 . 
( U ) This message has been cleared by [PER Codel Kerry  ] .
