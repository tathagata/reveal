Summary: Ambassador 's courtesy call was characterized by good atmospherics but little indication that the [ORG GOS  ] will move significantly on the issues of concern to us . 
Minister [PER Calvo  ] started by enthusiatically describing [ORG U.S.- Spain  ] cultural cooperation hightlights , especially the upcoming [PER Picasso  ] exhibit . 
The Minister agreed with the Ambassador on the need to fight [ORG Intellectual Property Rights  ] ( [ORG IPR  ] ) violations but did not indicate that the [ORG GOS  ] would put more energy into implementing its own excellent anti-piracy plan . 
[PER Calvo  ] said that the [LOC U.S.  ] firm , [ORG Odyssey Exploration Ltd.  ] , could look for [LOC HMS Sussex  ] if it provided a work plan to the regional government in [LOC Andalucia  ] , although work plans have been delivered in the past . 
[PER Calvo  ] said that the [ORG GOS  ] believed it was more appropriate for the [ORG Thyssen Foundation  ] to respond to Ambassador [PER O'Donnell  ] 's letter to her regarding the [PER Pissarro  ] painting claimed by [PER Claude Cassirer  ] , although the [ORG GOS  ] is on the [ORG Foundation  ] board and has a lot of influence over what the board does . 
End Summary ------------ Participants ------------ <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
[ORG International Cooperation and Cultural Communication  ] Director General [PER Carlos Alberdi Alonso  ] accompanied the Minister . 
Economic Officer accompanied the Ambassador. -------------------------------------------- [ORG U.S.- Spain Cultural/Educational Cooperation  ] -------------------------------------------- <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
Minister [PER Calvo  ] mentioned the upcoming 2006 Prado [PER Picasso  ] exhibit , which will include loaned works from several [MISC American  ] institutions . 
The [ORG Embassy  ] 's [ORG Public Affairs  ] section is working to facilitate these loans with a number of [LOC U.S.  ] institutions . 
[PER Calvo  ] also mentioned that prior to her political career ( she was [ORG Andalucia  ] 's equivalent of Minister of Culture before President [PER Zapatero  ] invited her to assume the national cultural portfolio ) she was a professor at the [ORG University of Cordoba  ] . 
She said that she had worked on the [LOC PRESHCO  ] ( [ORG Oberlin College  ] , [ORG Smith College  ] , [ORG The College of Wooster  ] , [ORG Trinity College  ] , [ORG Wellesley College  ] , and [ORG Wheaton  ] ) [ORG Hispanic Studies Program  ] with the [ORG University of Cordoba  ] which was enormously successful . 
The Minister also mentioned she was a [PER Bruce Springsteen  ] fan. ------------------------ [ORG IPR Protection Important  ] ------------------------ <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
The Ambassador said the September 28 ( ref A ) [ORG IPR Roundtable  ] had been a successful instance of [MISC U.S.-Spain  ] cooperation . 
The Minister agreed and said that the police had told her that [ORG IPR  ] violators made more money than drug traffickers . 
She added that [ORG IPR  ] violations were a " big problem " in [LOC Spain  ] . 
Local industry groups have been making the [ORG GOS  ] aware of the extent of the [ORG IPR  ] problem. -------------- [PER Cassirer Claim  ] -------------- <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
Ambassador mentioned that Ambassador [PER O'Donnell  ] had not received a response to his June 27 , 2005 letter to Minister [PER Calvo  ] re:the [PER Cassirer  ] claim . 
[PER Calvo  ] acknowledged that she had not responded . 
She also said that Foreign Minister [PER Moratinos  ] had raised the issue with her . 
[PER Calvo  ] said that because the [LOC Pisarro  ] painting claimed by [PER Cassirer  ] belonged to the [ORG Thyssen Foundation  ] ( of which the [ORG GOS  ] is a board member ) , it would be more appropriate for the [ORG Foundation  ] to respond to Ambassador [PER O'Donnell  ] 's letter . 
She added that while the [ORG GOS  ] " presides over the patrimony " of the [ORG Foundation  ] , the [ORG GOS  ] cannot " unilaterally " decide what to do . 
She asked her staffer , [PER Alberdi Alonso  ] , to follow up with Economic Officer on this matter . 
( Note: Economic Officer discussed the [PER Cassirer  ] claim with [PER Alberdi Alonso  ] . 
He noted that [ORG Spanish Cultural  ] Counselor [PER Sobredo  ] had recently discussed the claim with Ambassador [PER O'Donnell  ] . 
[PER Alberdi Alonso  ] said that Ambassador [PER O'Donnell  ] had conveyed " disappointment " to [PER Sobredo  ] re: this matter . 
[PER Alberdi Alonso  ] committed to following up . 
[ORG Embassy  ] will continue to press the [ORG GOS  ] on the desirability of the [ORG Foundation  ] meeting directly with the family to resolve the claim . 
) ------------------------------------- [ORG Odyssey  ] and the Search for [LOC HMS Sussex  ] ------------------------------------- <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
Ambassador mentioned that the [ORG Regional Authority of Andalucia  ] had still not responded to [ORG Odyssey  ] 's request to name an observer to accompany the [ORG Odyssey  ] in its search for [LOC HMS Sussex  ] . 
( [ORG Note:  ] The [ORG Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ] authorized in an August 18 , 2005 diplomatic note to the [ORG Embassy  ] the [ORG Odyssey  ] to search for the [ORG Sussex  ] as long as the [ORG Odyssey contacted  ] the regional authorities to get a representative to accompany the [ORG Odyssey  ] . 
The authorities have , however , never responded to [ORG Odyssey  ] 's inquiries re ; the topic . 
See refs B and C . 
) [PER Calvo  ] said she was intimately acquainted with this subject and said that the [ORG Odyssey had  ] never provided the regional authorities with a work plan as had been requested . 
She suggested that once a work plan was provided , the issue could be resolved . 
( Note: Emboffs remain in regular contact with [ORG Odyssey  ] officials in the [LOC U.S.  ] and [ORG Odyssey  ] 's attorneys in [ORG Madrid  ] . 
The Minister was disingenuous in her response to the Ambassador because [ORG Odyssey  ] has provided voluminous information to both [ORG GOS  ] and [MISC Andalucian  ] authorities . 
) ------- Comment ------- <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
The atmospherics of the meeting were good . 
[PER Calvo  ] clearly has religion like the rest of her cabinet colleagues on the need have good relations with the [LOC U.S.  ] However , with respect to the three big issues we have with her [ORG Ministry  ] , her ability/willingness to deliver is questionable . 
On [ORG IPR  ] matters there is philosophical agreement between the [LOC U.S.  ] and [LOC Spain  ] on most issues , but so far her [ORG Ministry  ] has not implemented its otherwise excellent anti-piracy plan vigorously . 
On the [PER Cassirer  ] claim , the [ORG GOS  ] could get the [ORG Foundation  ] to , at a minimum , provide an interim response to Ambassador [PER O'Donnell  ] 's letter without paying a discernible price . 
The [ORG Odyssey  ] is a six year saga with Minister [PER Calvo  ] on record in the past as saying that the [ORG Odyssey  ] would only search for [LOC HMS Sussex  ] " over her dead body " . 
The [MISC American  ] company is likely to commence the search for the [ORG Sussex  ] in the coming weeks and take the risk of having a [ORG Civil Guard  ] boat boarding the vessel . 
The [LOC U.S.  ] company is in a legally strong position given the [ORG MFA  ] diplomatic note authorizing the search . 
Minister [PER Calvo  ] 's staffer , [PER Carlos Alberdi Alonso  ] , said the [ORG MFA  ] had mistakenly provided the authorization as compentency lies with the regional authorities , but given the [ORG MFA  ] note and the overwhelming weight of international law favoring the [LOC U.S.  ] firm , the risk of boarding may well be worth taking for the [ORG Odyssey  ] .
