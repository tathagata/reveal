( C ) SUMMARY . 
The [MISC Boeing F18 Super  ] Hornet has had success in establishing itself as a strong candidate to be [LOC Brazil  ] 's next generation fighter but still faces strong political opposition . 
To succeed , the [ORG USG  ] and [ORG Boeing  ] will need a coordinated strategy aimed at highlighting the [ORG Super Hornet  ] 's advantages , correcting misinformation and building confidence in the [ORG USG  ] 's support for the purchase . 
Ideally , this will involve ongoing outreach from the [ORG USG  ] at high levels to the key [MISC Brazilian  ] decision makers . 
See Paragraph 9 for specific recommendations . 
END SUMMARY. <a id='par2' href='#par2'>¶</a>2 . 
( C ) As reported in ref a , the [MISC Boeing F18 Super  ] Hornet has become a serious option in [LOC Brazil  ] 's fighter competition , and is acknowledged by contacts in the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] as offering the best plane for a competitive price . 
Although these factors will continue to weigh in [ORG Boeing  ] 's favor , the [ORG Super Hornet  ] cannot at this point be considered the favorite in the competition . 
There continues to be a strong preconception among many in policy circles that a purchase from [LOC France  ] would be in [LOC Brazil  ] 's best interest , a view strengthened by the recent , well-publicized visit of President [PER Sarkozy  ] to Rio . 
Even though [PER Sarkozy  ] did not add any new substance to the " strategic partnership " ( deals to sell helicopters and submarines were already well-known ) , the optic of the Presidential visit has worked in [ORG Dassault  ] 's favor. <a id='par3' href='#par3'>¶</a>3 . 
( SBU ) In the last week , there has been new focus in the [MISC Brazilian  ] press on the fighter purchase , including some positive statements from [ORG Boeing  ] officials and accurate reporting that the [ORG Rafale  ] 's high price and limited capabilities have caused it to lose every foreign sale for which it has thus far competed . 
[MISC French  ] representatives have tried to spin the [ORG Rafale  ] 's dismal performance in the global market to be the result [ORG USG  ] political pressure rather than the aircraft 's shortcomings . 
The continuing challenge for [ORG Boeing  ] in press reporting is the ongoing assumption that there is a risk to choosing the [ORG Super Hornet  ] that the [ORG USG  ] will exercise some sort of " veto " over the sale at a later date . 
ELEMENTS OF A SUCCESSFUL BID ---------------------------- <a id='par4' href='#par4'>¶</a>4 . 
( C ) As noted in reftels , the FX2 decision will not be based on the capabilities of the aircraft selected and will only be marginally influenced by the price . 
[MISC Brazilian  ] decision makers will be looking at the offers of the competitors to determine which will benefit [LOC Brazil  ] , particularly [MISC Brazilian  ] defense industry . 
[ORG Boeing  ] , with its worldwide business and access to commercial aircraft production will have an attractive offer , but faces a challenge . 
Both [ORG Dassault  ] and [ORG Saab  ] are offering essentially new planes , not yet in production . 
They are therefore able to offer [LOC Brazil  ] whatever role it wants in the fabrication of the planes , not just the final assembly that [ORG Boeing  ] will offer. <a id='par5' href='#par5'>¶</a>5 . 
( C ) Ref b highlighted the critical importance of technology transfer . 
With current efforts in [LOC Washington  ] to approve technology sharing to the fullest extent possible , we expect [ORG Boeing  ] will have a strong offer by the Feb. 2 deadline to respond to the Request for Proposal ( [ORG RFP  ] ) . 
It will be vital , before the final response goes forward , to ensure that it meets all [MISC Brazilian  ] requirements . 
As noted in ref b , it will be critical for the [ORG Boeing  ] offer to keep open the possibility of integrating [MISC Brazilian  ] made weapons on the F18 at some point . 
Given the huge emphasis the new [ORG National Defense Strategy  ] places on support to [MISC Brazilian  ] industry , excluding any opportunity for indigenous products to be used would be a major blow to [ORG Boeing  ] 's chances. <a id='par6' href='#par6'>¶</a>6 . 
( C ) It will be as important as approving the tech transfer itself to overcome the assumption that the [ORG USG  ] can step in at a later date to restrict the transfer . 
While we can explain that we stopped transfer of [LOC F16s  ] to [LOC Venezuela  ] because of setbacks in democratic governance and interference in the security of neighboring states -- circumstances [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000041 002 OF 003 unthinkable in the [MISC Brazilian  ] context -- the [MISC Brazilians  ] tend to take the fact that we stopped the transfer as evidence that the [LOC United States  ] is an unreliable supplier . 
To combat this assumption will require ongoing high level [ORG USG  ] assurances , both directly to the [MISC Brazilian  ] leadership and publicly , that we can foresee no circumstance in which we would restrict the transfer of fighters to [LOC Brazil  ] . 
As the [ORG State Department  ] is perceived by [MISC Brazilians  ] as the most likely source of a potential veto , it will be critical for high level [ORG Department  ] involvement in this effort. <a id='par7' href='#par7'>¶</a>7 . 
( C ) In ref b , post reported on the [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] 's likely requirements for financing of the new fighters . 
With the [ORG USG  ] 's long experience in Foreign Military sales , it should be possible to work out a set of financing arrangements that would offer an advantage over the competition , especially since [ORG Boeing  ] believes its aircraft will have the lowest life cycle costs . 
KEY PLAYERS ----------- <a id='par8' href='#par8'>¶</a>8 . 
( C ) The strongest supporters of the [ORG Super Hornet  ] are likely to be the military leadership , in particular [MISC Brazilian  ] [ORG Air Force  ] chief [PER Brig. Junito Saito  ] , who we believe perceive the [ORG Boeing  ] offer as the best deal on the best aircraft and see the [LOC United States  ] military as the better choice of a partner going forward . 
We may also be able to garner support from [MISC Brazilian  ] industry , including [ORG Embraer  ] , if [ORG Boeing  ] can offer strong prospects for longer-term cooperation and mutual profit . 
While the initial review of the proposals will be done by the [ORG Air Force  ] , final decisions will be made at higher levels of the [MISC Brazilian  ] government . 
The final decision will be made by President [PER Lula  ] , who is likely to take a more pragmatic view of which offer would most benefit [LOC Brazil  ] , but will also be swayed by arguments regarding how the purchase will affect [LOC Brazil  ] 's standing as an independent global power . 
In making a recommendation to [PER Lula  ] , Defense Minister [PER Jobim  ] will play the key role at the policy level . 
While [PER Jobim  ] has a good relationship with the [ORG USG  ] , he has been a strong public supporter of the strategic partnership with [LOC France  ] . 
Foreign Minister [PER Amorim  ] and Minister for [ORG Strategic Planning  ] [PER Roberto Mangabeira Unger  ] will also have a say ; both see a purchase from the [LOC U.S.  ] as leading to an undesirable " dependency . 
" Finally , presidential advisors , including Civilian Household Minister [PER Dilma Rousseff  ] and Foreign Policy Advisor [PER Marco Aurelio Garcia  ] , will likely serve as sounding boards for [PER Lula  ] as he makes a decision . 
RECOMMENDATIONS --------------- <a id='par9' href='#par9'>¶</a>9 . 
( C ) As we look to the next three to four months as the key period in which the fighter competition may be won , there are several opportunities for the [ORG USG  ] to maximize our chances: -- The key step for the [ORG USG  ] over the next month will be to get the question of technology transfer right . 
While the [MISC Brazilians  ] will not get the keys to the proverbial candy store , there should be enough sweeteners in [ORG Boeing  ] 's offer to make the case that the [ORG Super Hornet  ] includes the best tech . 
The offer must also address the key points raised in ref b ( source codes , weapons integration , etc . 
) . 
-- Once the [ORG RFP  ] response is in , we should be prepared to raise the FX2 at every high level contact with [LOC Brazil  ] . 
There has been a perception that [ORG USG  ] support is weak that needs to be countered . 
The most effective way of doing so would be to have President [PER Obama  ] make a strong statement advocating the [ORG Super Hornet  ] to President [PER Lula  ] at the earliest opportunity . 
The President Elect 's outstanding popularity with [MISC Brazilians  ] , the personal affinity that [PER Lula  ] has publicly expressed , and the high expectations for relations with the new [ORG U.S. Administration  ] will ensure that his advocacy will have an impact . 
-- We should follow up the [ORG RFP  ] response submission with visits from appropriate officials to reassure the [MISC Brazilian  ] government of [ORG USG  ] support for [ORG Boeing  ] 's proposal . 
Ideally , this would begin with an interagency team ( State , [LOC OSD  ] , [LOC DTSA  ] , [ORG SOUTHCOM  ] ) visit in February at Assistant Secretary level to try to put to rest the notion that there could be a [ORG USG  ] veto . 
Visits should include a public diplomacy component . 
-- Government to government efforts should be supplemented [LOC BRASILIA  ] 00000041 003 OF 003 by improved outreach to highlight the advantages of the [ORG Super Hornet  ] and counter misinformation campaigns from the other competitors that the [ORG USG  ] will not be a reliable partner . 
-- [LOC Washington  ] agencies should be prepared to receive [ORG BRAF  ] finance representatives in February to discus likely [MISC Brazilian  ] requirements .
